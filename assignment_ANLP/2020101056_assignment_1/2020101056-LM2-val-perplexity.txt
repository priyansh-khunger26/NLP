“Adieu till then.”	343.5150477955657
Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo, whose	353.6700975196042
lips turned pale, but who preserved his ceremonious smile, Andrea	310.4362897901463
seized the count’s hand, pressed it, jumped into his phaeton, and	373.6591919618243
disappeared.	338.0125428718548
The four or five remaining hours before nine o’clock arrived, Andrea	398.79888768941316
employed in riding, paying visits,—designed to induce those of whom he	386.160545273684
had spoken to appear at the banker’s in their gayest	336.51308271153596
equipages,—dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have	347.8119614195698
since turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the	373.65180290549426
initiative.	405.81403630812656
In fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon, the gallery	366.4583829013832
adjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same floor, were	401.92321122567654
filled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little in the event,	465.5861413977081
but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there	359.6441103592329
is anything fresh to be seen. An Academician would say that the	390.07727350247444
entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers	468.2641609059333
which attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing	314.5957016823397
drones.	314.11766154853194
50025m	457.45890116811825
No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light	359.61294056949396
streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the	473.9116718007766
bad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of,	380.18378415418954
shone in its splendor. Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant	441.082250195542
simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half	426.1121468501336
concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by	402.18668557392067
a single jewel. Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence	364.704590284263
which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire.	388.8531494471813
Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray,	434.13383469030396
Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud. Debray was admitted to the house for	421.10006978023654
this grand ceremony, but on the same plane with everyone else, and	475.9458360673381
without any particular privilege. M. Danglars, surrounded by deputies	487.48276225088864
and men connected with the revenue, was explaining a new theory of	410.3625154442461
taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had	484.62428922026334
compelled the government to call him into the ministry. Andrea, on	495.04371135220237
whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the Opera, was	460.67525994623816
explaining to him rather cleverly, since he was obliged to be bold to	441.3225126652618
appear at ease, his future projects, and the new luxuries he meant to	431.6550391777878
introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy-five	417.154930070546
thousand livres per annum.	462.59388914820653
The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of	385.44959454225716
turquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds. As usual, the oldest	366.83312848351704
women were the most decorated, and the ugliest the most conspicuous. If	335.27656947108056
there was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it,	451.16727667616755
concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with	385.1624924142039
a bird-of-paradise.	405.2778893995836
At each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the	392.5710881274398
laughter, the door-keeper’s voice was heard announcing some name well	486.82547801997663
known in the financial department, respected in the army, or	376.79829211378814
illustrious in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a	462.8271630606633
slight movement in the different groups. But for one whose privilege it	357.5047974811423
was to agitate that ocean of human waves, how many were received with a	319.0623922760694
look of indifference or a sneer of disdain!	309.45389356396436
At the moment when the hand of the massive time-piece, representing	380.255604681194
Endymion asleep, pointed to nine on its golden face, and the hammer,	398.9301242077828
the faithful type of mechanical thought, struck nine times, the name of	418.4956558578889
the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn, and as if by an	337.64528781049717
electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door. The count was	447.91661165948784
dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his white waistcoat	326.5407526649595
displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly	456.9027789063386
noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his	394.8695073423435
face. His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the slender gold	417.6070429378168
thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat.	428.2537981311228
A circle was immediately formed around the door. The count perceived at	408.1512331421547
one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars	334.12789194401086
at the other, and Eugénie in front of him. He first advanced towards	330.09356027646083
the baroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come	431.5661552741183
alone, Valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so	420.5594551199476
clear was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to	324.2148593976587
Eugénie, whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that	493.83432504272804
the proud artist was quite struck. Near her was Mademoiselle Louise	361.6643339553998
d’Armilly, who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had	377.6379726895192
so kindly given her for Italy, which she intended immediately to make	380.99805204032464
use of. On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars, who had	463.37439273634396
advanced to meet him.	352.6036741060358
Having accomplished these three social duties, Monte Cristo stopped,	362.46814795469237
looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class,	441.2739985285687
which seems to say, “I have done my duty, now let others do theirs.”	348.2089666151022
Andrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation	479.83872280791826
caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his	397.55996978414447
respects to the count. He found him completely surrounded; all were	348.7663953045016
eager to speak to him, as is always the case with those whose words are	407.4699695432057
few and weighty. The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged	440.9885891782577
their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which	384.71512368568546
covered the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table	373.2989075540242
supported on lions’ claws. One of the notaries sat down, the other	454.9812620653612
remained standing. They were about to proceed to the reading of the	485.1075909798715
contract, which half Paris assembled was to sign. All took their	390.00094894022254
places, or rather the ladies formed a circle, while the gentlemen (more	408.1570681547604
indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the _style	428.9356064455751
énergique_) commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea, on M.	430.8848425597447
Danglars’ riveted attention, Eugénie’s composure, and the light and	436.6951298690404
sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair.	490.03016303607274
The contract was read during a profound silence. But as soon as it was	346.563929456904
finished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the	422.00127580060985
brilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command of	410.34862776431834
the two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding	345.2289212061096
presents and the young lady’s diamonds, which had been made in a room	463.1608568330288
entirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their	360.4720815784281
delusions over the envious assembly.	424.0307748011954
Mademoiselle Danglars’ charms were heightened in the opinion of the	431.1945313372754
young men, and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor. As	402.0021789895361
for the ladies, it is needless to say that while they coveted the	479.5098626546302
millions, they thought they did not need them for themselves, as they	356.71830862607237
were beautiful enough without them. Andrea, surrounded by his friends,	483.7233695415219
complimented, flattered, beginning to believe in the reality of his	398.0103022970196
dream, was almost bewildered. The notary solemnly took the pen,	406.2090235130889
flourished it above his head, and said:	323.51229459645424
“Gentlemen, we are about to sign the contract.”	342.66648891193483
The baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti,	299.22834902821023
senior, then the baroness, afterwards the “future couple,” as they are	490.717469316893
styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents.	417.08432320266036
The baron took the pen and signed, then the representative. The	337.6115355490705
baroness approached, leaning on Madame de Villefort’s arm.	361.56351766040586
“My dear,” said she, as she took the pen, “is it not vexatious? An	417.5613656787288
unexpected incident, in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of	453.456444132159
Monte Cristo’s, in which he nearly fell a victim, deprives us of the	405.28318512785864
pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort.”	376.44743409702886
“Indeed?” said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have	462.2888063725121
said, “Oh, well, what do I care?”	303.8219449716298
“As a matter of fact,” said Monte Cristo, approaching, “I am much	311.48818467334723
afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence.”	424.6018864070056
“What, you, count?” said Madame Danglars, signing; “if you are, take	380.8971449866038
care, for I shall never forgive you.”	477.4798891216773
Andrea pricked up his ears.	363.82792348398505
“But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.”	404.720504560614
Everyone listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips,	402.11124124876955
was about to speak.	401.5108651134379
“You remember,” said the count, during the most profound silence, “that	462.3771364763529
the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house; the supposition	424.81687736442257
is that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting to leave it.”	307.7825324635817
“Yes,” said Danglars.	378.4139815365212
“In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his	402.0965117949608
clothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up,	456.5865529902324
with the exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked.”	329.41716231808545
Andrea turned pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in	410.1262475453097
the horizon, which appeared to forebode a coming storm.	489.01803931060095
“Well, this waistcoat was discovered today, covered with blood, and	299.2399333717275
with a hole over the heart.” The ladies screamed, and two or three	497.9917318685766
prepared to faint. “It was brought to me. No one could guess what the	477.5530196576851
dirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the	436.53833294893184
murdered man. My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper	429.1106340697286
in the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you,	370.0541585021787
baron.”	301.9654818724056
“To me?” cried Danglars.	426.8016389501825
“Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the	395.2545942688396
blood with which the letter was stained,” replied Monte Cristo, amid	457.5040588744605
the general outburst of amazement.	423.1706727771105
“But,” asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness,	477.29475176613636
“how could that prevent M. de Villefort——”	323.49429642821934
“In this simple way, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “the waistcoat and	496.6479240925577
the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I	399.80652317284284
therefore sent them to the king’s attorney. You understand, my dear	355.2556738051675
baron, that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was,	404.0605528459705
perhaps, some plot against you.” Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo	322.8702521901088
and disappeared in the second drawing-room.	427.9819971565499
“Possibly,” said Danglars; “was not this murdered man an old	322.5296705300441
galley-slave?”	386.3684211109889
50025m	355.4841328398996
“Yes,” replied the count; “a felon named Caderousse.” Danglars turned	345.5675791746811
slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little	318.2402110956127
drawing-room.	492.9670080252077
“But go on signing,” said Monte Cristo; “I perceive that my story has	405.0158173475868
caused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and	344.6850231981009
to Mademoiselle Danglars.”	386.0426060472139
The baroness, who had signed, returned the pen to the notary.	412.6165609728788
“Prince Cavalcanti,” said the latter; “Prince Cavalcanti, where are	378.161708137613
you?”	481.42019525192643
“Andrea, Andrea,” repeated several young people, who were already on	442.493253558692
sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.	341.0355725304655
“Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign,” cried	382.58520633615024
Danglars to one of the floorkeepers.	497.15431423982454
But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the	326.07782743070646
principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the	369.9315990007138
apartments, _quærens quem devoret_. There was, indeed, reason to	411.27429970864637
retreat, to be alarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two	435.30605409225643
soldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards	434.0091803435977
Danglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf.	486.0550975491069
Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted. Danglars, who thought	331.86889817683664
himself threatened (certain consciences are never calm),—Danglars even	478.69145742143564
before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror.	354.65492002577827
“What is the matter, sir?” asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the	345.99410987083417
commissioner.	306.42708123157047
“Which of you gentlemen,” asked the magistrate, without replying to the	470.99417893267685
count, “answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?”	397.8620779642234
A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room. They	339.3427010774608
searched; they questioned.	320.6451519823055
“But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti?” asked Danglars in amazement.	414.5517365308515
“A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon.”	368.7884407024934
“And what crime has he committed?”	422.71800640786046
“He is accused,” said the commissary with his inflexible voice, “of	364.0939031424114
having assassinated the man named Caderousse, his former companion in	402.36880688555004
prison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the	307.87079121178976
Count of Monte Cristo.”	434.97893722471565
Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him. Andrea was gone.	352.6899765046426
 Chapter 97. The Departure for Belgium	440.966598397778
A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M.	486.4762553723415
Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and	435.22052618894395
by the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as	465.1383623594793
much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken	422.1700363855367
out among the guests.	498.51891826413265
In a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the staircases, by	452.3458783625405
every exit, everyone hastened to retire, or rather to fly; for it was a	313.02510963013805
situation where the ordinary condolences,—which even the best friends	497.1943871954572
are so eager to offer in great catastrophes,—were seen to be utterly	370.6226821326759
futile. There remained in the banker’s house only Danglars, closeted in	339.51803131829223
his study, and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes; Madame	490.70642721116565
Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we are acquainted; and	342.91525980892015
Eugénie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her	318.6340147019672
room with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.	303.97364075136306
As for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than usual,	491.9155438229414
for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Café de	394.2313059462804
Paris), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the	488.2721270500565
insult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups in	457.67861089247566
the hall, in the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of	306.017103002589
their duty, which was thus naturally interrupted. Of all this	331.3131455469222
household, only two persons deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle	496.03360448558175
Eugénie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.	397.4463477727802
The betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful	301.5987814195985
lip, and the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion,	496.2210410990518
who was paler and more disturbed than herself. On reaching her room	349.44993358556076
Eugénie locked her door, while Louise fell on a chair.	437.4384699036781
“Ah, what a dreadful thing,” said the young musician; “who would have	438.56904341627273
suspected it? M. Andrea Cavalcanti a murderer—a galley-slave escaped—a	370.6696567271077
convict!”	389.79718716534484
An ironical smile curled the lip of Eugénie. “In truth, I was fated,”	300.03711413012184
said she. “I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti.”	349.1795563309322
“Oh, do not confound the two, Eugénie.”	331.9195426629991
“Hold your tongue! The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be able	395.4366882246246
now to do more than detest them—I despise them.”	423.1171741527494
“What shall we do?” asked Louise.	392.6803806435914
“What shall we do?”	379.73778858827865
“Yes.”	399.4835843208651
“Why, the same we had intended doing three days since—set off.”	401.1219561009311
“What?—although you are not now going to be married, you intend	303.352778367355
still——”	300.91455709942954
“Listen, Louise. I hate this life of the fashionable world, always	311.8047552410936
ordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper. What I have always	425.61460662096425
wished for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and	479.6419001675372
independent, relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to	313.88876224906954
myself. Remain here? What for?—that they may try, a month hence, to	421.4371054369671
marry me again; and to whom?—M. Debray, perhaps, as it was once	319.50806409286554
proposed. No, Louise, no! This evening’s adventure will serve for my	388.64540021602136
excuse. I did not seek one, I did not ask for one. God sends me this,	330.4740450071709
and I hail it joyfully!”	384.0140982709128
“How strong and courageous you are!” said the fair, frail girl to her	321.9998550741568
brunette companion.	341.635551651532
“Did you not yet know me? Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs. The	364.4514315053202
post-chaise——”	420.644282329863
“Was happily bought three days since.”	368.9807574825488
“Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?”	477.660164703308
“Yes.”	390.2679677939986
“Our passport?”	342.2201826848264
“Here it is.”	454.09482652665645
And Eugénie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and	402.5353764323901
read:	310.4663146453299
“M. Léon d’Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist; hair	383.0963432984987
black, eyes black; travelling with his sister.”	324.5730093076665
“Capital! How did you get this passport?”	373.4278625809059
“When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of	341.91583633271273
the theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as	372.71731925100215
a woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me	460.3630699436321
a man’s passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have	391.1660514602041
added with my own hand, ‘travelling with his sister.’”	374.5613908034866
50035m	321.56729551099824
“Well,” said Eugénie cheerfully, “we have then only to pack up our	476.06537122854456
trunks; we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract,	442.03613305347005
instead of the evening of the wedding—that is all.”	354.01157006046463
“But consider the matter seriously, Eugénie!”	360.45138785339657
“Oh, I am done with considering! I am tired of hearing only of market	454.019932727825
reports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish	439.0832889690794
funds, of Haitian bonds. Instead of that, Louise—do you	401.65620718174915
understand?—air, liberty, melody of birds, plains of Lombardy, Venetian	494.3805718401667
canals, Roman palaces, the Bay of Naples. How much have we, Louise?”	386.77102628282415
The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid	445.85412825626315
secretaire a small portfolio with a lock, in which she counted	453.7724593891973
twenty-three bank-notes.	422.2832342047138
“Twenty-three thousand francs,” said she.	311.25348286534864
“And as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels,” said Eugénie.	485.5246972066494
“We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs we can live like	448.37952858558276
princesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six	380.1941636325877
months—you with your music, and I with my voice—we shall double our	431.2517791842061
capital. Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the jewel-box;	426.05309269905507
so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other	465.867519346579
would still have hers left. Now, the portmanteau—let us make haste—the	465.4435249835414
portmanteau!”	365.4082723416007
“Stop!” said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars’ door.	462.6883594218873
“What do you fear?”	368.6526901211425
“That we may be discovered.”	378.6809987055929
“The door is locked.”	318.1044849014389
“They may tell us to open it.”	468.82072733274646
“They may if they like, but we will not.”	405.81006027529907
“You are a perfect Amazon, Eugénie!” And the two young girls began to	390.7811408336805
heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.	452.80246319061393
“There now,” said Eugénie, “while I change my costume do you lock the	455.0952864306572
portmanteau.” Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands	410.9169919658374
on the top of the portmanteau.	383.4315798601524
“But I cannot,” said she; “I am not strong enough; do you shut it.”	388.7988285185446
“Ah, you do well to ask,” said Eugénie, laughing; “I forgot that I was	488.19863374226
Hercules, and you only the pale Omphale!”	497.7076182341086
And the young girl, kneeling on the top, pressed the two parts of the	330.9307209803414
portmanteau together, and Mademoiselle d’Armilly passed the bolt of the	488.73081383841327
padlock through. When this was done, Eugénie opened a drawer, of which	340.39656342721764
she kept the key, and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling	419.69848266267786
cloak.	401.266977163558
“Here,” said she, “you see I have thought of everything; with this	311.72384831549596
cloak you will not be cold.”	329.3569024412059
“But you?”	310.07550126393164
“Oh, I am never cold, you know! Besides, with these men’s clothes——”	443.91302582442756
“Will you dress here?”	360.3682273363378
“Certainly.”	489.13263556510867
“Shall you have time?”	330.19584180590806
“Do not be uneasy, you little coward! All our servants are busy,	369.6707405802483
discussing the grand affair. Besides, what is there astonishing, when	318.0177915889745
you think of the grief I ought to be in, that I shut myself up?—tell	362.7576436322238
me!”	498.9643570854056
“No, truly—you comfort me.”	318.36987439986996
“Come and help me.”	357.4667292025753
From the same drawer she took a man’s complete costume, from the boots	391.1659504502618
to the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing	453.6666741521333
superfluous, but every requisite. Then, with a promptitude which	351.07783568862425
indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by	480.688552208087
adopting the garb of the opposite sex, Eugénie drew on the boots and	364.5924040081474
pantaloons, tied her cravat, buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat,	425.6849142822048
and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure.	498.9141937459239
“Oh, that is very good—indeed, it is very good!” said Louise, looking	328.50765749586003
at her with admiration; “but that beautiful black hair, those	476.5031157522801
magnificent braids, which made all the ladies sigh with envy,—will they	312.6934814221503
go under a man’s hat like the one I see down there?”	369.4712417311506
“You shall see,” said Eugénie. And with her left hand seizing the thick	463.7691510215891
mass, which her long fingers could scarcely grasp, she took in her	490.4980284646347
right hand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel met through the	480.15332122464315
rich and splendid hair, which fell in a cluster at her feet as she	321.2239375268474
leaned back to keep it from her coat. Then she grasped the front hair,	356.81511234976085
which she also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the	321.2976833231396
contrary, her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her	391.0892383000211
ebony eyebrows.	488.92451046278705
50039m	396.31573598612715
“Oh, the magnificent hair!” said Louise, with regret.	357.7270161728243
“And am I not a hundred times better thus?” cried Eugénie, smoothing	362.439780585975
the scattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine	340.9466193236384
appearance; “and do you not think me handsomer so?”	445.37887874263026
“Oh, you are beautiful—always beautiful!” cried Louise. “Now, where are	376.3896862529988
you going?”	345.2318916016955
“To Brussels, if you like; it is the nearest frontier. We can go to	354.31021259761394
Brussels, Liège, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasbourg. We	359.07470674343773
will cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard.	491.82092902090756
Will that do?”	317.6233336123799
“Yes.”	312.3787124974124
“What are you looking at?”	437.77792161353256
“I am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! One would say	403.79195936290483
you were carrying me off.”	367.24498027173547
“And they would be right, _pardieu!_”	360.6366129246753
“Oh, I think you swore, Eugénie.”	317.33453767306986
And the two young girls, whom everyone might have thought plunged in	433.0842227888324
grief, the one on her own account, the other from interest in her	477.2997055178648
friend, burst out laughing, as they cleared away every visible trace of	305.6145261920447
the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their	325.0638932405789
escape. Then, having blown out the lights, the two fugitives, looking	491.8641935092525
and listening eagerly, with outstretched necks, opened the door of a	449.75067655398163
dressing-room which led by a side staircase down to the yard,—Eugénie	348.5475304080516
going first, and holding with one arm the portmanteau, which by the	448.84836345015975
opposite handle Mademoiselle d’Armilly scarcely raised with both hands.	355.81556952369795
The yard was empty; the clock was striking twelve. The porter was not	318.49231942412564
yet gone to bed. Eugénie approached softly, and saw the old man	370.3762407306932
sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge. She returned to Louise,	355.30284596737573
took up the portmanteau, which she had placed for a moment on the	421.0685522855447
ground, and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall.	360.25764938249887
Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway, so that if the	489.4976469484093
porter chanced to awake he might see but one person. Then placing	373.6697300025895
herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard:	437.83632792106505
“Gate!” cried she, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping at the	383.8886835098541
window.	438.7249857509038
The porter got up as Eugénie expected, and even advanced some steps to	358.9518747321777
recognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking	496.7612712130771
his boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.	336.3576961846636
Louise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded	299.3019332241392
lightly forward. Eugénie, apparently calm, although in all probability	311.36038806650595
her heart beat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn.	408.42827278450557
A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two	327.6069093447063
young girls, having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire,	473.2653347578164
walked behind this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for	389.44862745866004
Eugénie, she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at	307.40283450482144
the appointed spot. Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the	426.0559486621878
portmanteau, gave him some pieces of money, and having rapped at the	399.8009076331573
shutter sent him away. The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of	492.1190126617517
a little laundress, who had been previously warned, and was not yet	400.50227641778747
gone to bed. She opened the door.	435.86243450816795
“Mademoiselle,” said Eugénie, “let the porter get the post-chaise from	314.1696350290737
the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel. Here are	319.7744642184672
five francs for his trouble.”	484.2340355510988
“Indeed,” said Louise, “I admire you, and I could almost say respect	471.21228940828064
you.” The laundress looked on in astonishment, but as she had been	337.62899582202084
promised twenty louis, she made no remark.	420.034694536354
In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses,	487.50053990986567
which were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the	314.57540722058854
porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and	349.97998632960486
strap.	471.48986719272284
“Here is the passport,” said the postilion, “which way are we going,	478.5280236129098
young gentleman?”	358.3451741075777
“To Fontainebleau,” replied Eugénie with an almost masculine voice.	424.0455921577469
“What do you say?” said Louise.	477.748857053116
“I am giving them the slip,” said Eugénie; “this woman to whom we have	498.12604239312157
given twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our	432.31057494121137
direction.”	430.3766794400335
And the young girl jumped into the britzka, which was admirably	378.0241035306035
arranged for sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.	353.3219254319995
“You are always right,” said the music teacher, seating herself by the	484.5252594411089
side of her friend.	487.95627125041494
A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion, having been put in the	491.9571588456197
right road, passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the	494.05820590434575
Barrière Saint-Martin.	462.33577256473086
“Ah,” said Louise, breathing freely, “here we are out of Paris.”	410.6915695906547
“Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact,” replied Eugénie.	393.83744141496544
“Yes, and without violence,” said Louise.	491.21148092955207
“I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance,” replied	492.3882014434806
Eugénie.	453.88212612970096
These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling	331.6354462933476
over the pavement of La Villette. M. Danglars no longer had a daughter.	358.49892258076557
 Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern	378.4907328396772
And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing	434.67101078887913
their way to Brussels, and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so	490.74208967469184
inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune. Notwithstanding his	439.16966076438484
youth, Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy. We have	422.7796072801371
seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually	433.8669926130923
approached the door, and crossing two or three rooms at last	455.58888966381664
disappeared. But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance, which	451.1784357910377
nevertheless ought not to be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed,	486.0990496876575
the _trousseau_ of the bride-elect was on exhibition. There were	421.2045328355747
caskets of diamonds, cashmere shawls, Valenciennes lace, English veils,	414.60733928136807
and in fact all the tempting things, the bare mention of which makes	353.6810269716137
the hearts of young girls bound with joy, and which is called the	387.45971480951226
_corbeille_.22 Now, in passing through this room, Andrea proved himself	431.3106639082421
not only to be clever and intelligent, but also provident, for he	312.7877390723817
helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him.	471.34007601347906
Furnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from	365.36319181564255
the window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes. Tall	299.7254152606164
and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a	469.6108445418954
Spartan, he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to	390.6204129006605
direct his steps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the	419.41921413669905
spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken. Having	449.1502858709546
passed through the Rue du Mont-Blanc, guided by the instinct which	391.38645199462053
leads thieves always to take the safest path, he found himself at the	459.33580404329496
end of the Rue La Fayette. There he stopped, breathless and panting. He	407.38592986648575
was quite alone; on one side was the vast wilderness of the	450.47044042977706
Saint-Lazare, on the other, Paris enshrouded in darkness.	372.7589411078643
“Am I to be captured?” he cried; “no, not if I can use more activity	311.54391253214607
than my enemies. My safety is now a mere question of speed.”	463.5507256980224
At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnière.	350.49753538755857
The dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits	474.33846383459564
of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his	432.73713890880657
station.	391.57957648177006
“Ho, friend!” said Benedetto.	442.12784769795917
“What do you want, sir?” asked the driver.	328.12274111212014
“Is your horse tired?”	322.9778981810898
“Tired? oh, yes, tired enough—he has done nothing the whole of this	394.9122433458366
blessed day! Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all	326.05118245955464
seven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to	421.055522829613
the owner.”	361.4872729056555
“Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?”	408.9855574639047
“With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. Tell me what	312.232931951164
I am to do for this.”	395.9615406608515
“A very easy thing, if your horse isn’t tired.”	470.9811005816306
“I tell you he’ll go like the wind,—only tell me which way to drive.”	382.53633538150393
“Towards the Louvres.”	331.62472943562375
“Ah, I know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there.”	459.7667388455907
“Exactly so; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom I	354.4681171450109
am going to hunt tomorrow at Chapelle-en-Serval. He should have waited	465.2272612004638
for me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and,	363.39986873901546
tired of waiting, he must have gone on.”	430.34093285011204
“It is likely.”	410.3602731309752
“Well, will you try and overtake him?”	302.8297888444664
“Nothing I should like better.”	443.7450799469624
“If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have	334.8306295602709
twenty francs; if not before Louvres, thirty.”	386.70787020469567
“And if we do overtake him?”	455.2239754477896
“Forty,” said Andrea, after a moment’s hesitation, at the end of which	341.2990305994679
he remembered that he might safely promise.	490.98748163813417
“That’s all right,” said the man; “hop in, and we’re off! Who-o-o-pla!”	358.5342441269729
Andrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the Faubourg	336.5794892072243
Saint-Denis, along the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and	424.8029543621381
threaded its way through the interminable Villette. They never overtook	420.6600304514635
the chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot	346.0571322728327
whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green	372.5236961399629
cabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be	347.43400520754477
seen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are	368.99347559652404
green, the inquiries increased at every step. Everyone had just seen it	473.9436478231031
pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in	353.6957356494632
advance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend. Once the	305.5134187660983
cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two	417.06493256066005
post-horses.	332.56930526533665
“Ah,” said Cavalcanti to himself, “if I only had that britzka, those	377.99305454439195
two good post-horses, and above all the passport that carries them on!”	465.2457148148951
And he sighed deeply.	413.8269631464839
The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d’Armilly.	483.17068816800827
“Hurry, hurry!” said Andrea, “we must overtake him soon.”	477.3170349137752
And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since	312.3680315545798
leaving the barrier, and arrived steaming at Louvres.	367.49835180726313
“Certainly,” said Andrea, “I shall not overtake my friend, but I shall	346.70223739092603
kill your horse, therefore I had better stop. Here are thirty francs; I	448.398099700389
will sleep at the _Cheval Rouge_, and will secure a place in the first	374.867276600876
coach. Good-night, friend.”	302.91620454529755
And Andrea, after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man’s	446.32404533035447
hand, leaped lightly on to the pathway. The cabman joyfully pocketed	410.6758621520295
the sum, and turned back on his road to Paris. Andrea pretended to go	327.094570419989
towards the hotel of the _Cheval Rouge_, but after leaning an instant	401.0868659543653
against the door, and hearing the last sound of the cab, which was	310.3857033666506
disappearing from view, he went on his road, and with a lusty stride	483.06037101543427
soon traversed the space of two leagues. Then he rested; he must be	384.55638960804595
near Chapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going.	377.16055782279875
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form	411.1308634738075
some resolution, adopt some plan. It would be impossible to make use of	411.14529140248965
a diligence, equally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a	487.9274435376273
passport was necessary. It was still more impossible to remain in the	379.06621646994324
department of the Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in	355.38456656374495
France; this was quite out of the question, especially to a man like	308.268887186996
Andrea, perfectly conversant with criminal matters.	337.4718265718598
He sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and	487.30028491052167
reflected. Ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was	341.8951965065693
made. He threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to	443.296857109382
unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume, and going	359.12673603176574
to Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in	346.9715526601218
the place.	318.958097966094
The host opened.	360.9681401201444
“My friend,” said Andrea, “I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis,	375.65615100527566
when my horse, which is a troublesome creature, stumbled and threw me.	490.5946444183447
I must reach Compiègne tonight, or I shall cause deep anxiety to my	341.4430686879968
family. Could you let me hire a horse of you?”	373.4459382115412
An innkeeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad. The	344.7866015032627
host called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then	393.9285872625437
he awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride	370.34147650010624
before the gentleman and bring back the horse. Andrea gave the	472.5698091587815
innkeeper twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a	336.8687986245194
visiting card. This belonged to one of his friends at the Café de	445.0309789254835
Paris, so that the innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was	304.3910402660151
convinced that he had let his horse to the Count of Mauléon, 25 Rue	344.1789672685372
Saint-Dominique, that being the name and address on the card.	359.9390758034218
_Le Blanc_ was not a fast animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace;	422.74633858129147
in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which	430.0619907047849
separated him from Compiègne, and four o’clock struck as he reached the	390.50732596732377
place where the coaches stop. There is an excellent tavern at	461.62221283131805
Compiègne, well remembered by those who have ever been there. Andrea,	345.8086689624751
who had often stayed there in his rides about Paris, recollected the	391.57006431761
Bell and Bottle inn; he turned around, saw the sign by the light of a	497.7568719898197
reflected lamp, and having dismissed the child, giving him all the	337.48368762533096
small coin he had about him, he began knocking at the door, very	331.642726756612
reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he	391.26444972044465
had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound	496.83639497466766
sleep and a good supper. A waiter opened the door.	388.92164396917815
“My friend,” said Andrea, “I have been dining at Saint-Jean-aux-Bois,	437.49816347108725
and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a	439.03452434612564
fool I have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours	402.1733475827032
in the forest. Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which	361.01335332142486
overlook the court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux.”	408.3654214774496
The waiter had no suspicions; Andrea spoke with perfect composure, he	478.0460647602084
had a cigar in his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat;	493.0460744843991
his clothes were fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots	398.74074765253613
irreproachable; he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late,	314.7325686314542
that was all. While the waiter was preparing his room, the hostess	405.1797078087416
arose; Andrea assumed his most charming smile, and asked if he could	332.6661950875161
have No. 3, which he had occupied on his last stay at Compiègne.	376.4101081425208
Unfortunately, No. 3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with	490.7153903588865
his sister. Andrea appeared in despair, but consoled himself when the	485.4631725512928
hostess assured him that No. 7, prepared for him, was situated	397.4030771205189
precisely the same as No. 3, and while warming his feet and chatting	356.3244164589187
about the last races at Chantilly, he waited until they announced his	381.1168637040436
room to be ready.	470.9003900751193
Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out	422.47286504706403
upon the court of the Bell Hotel, which with its triple galleries like	483.70409521455827
those of a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the	489.4450907006451
light columns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you	412.61491266494716
can imagine. The fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and	381.4757949765491
sparkling, and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good	484.1539453563556
an appetite as though nothing had happened. Then he went to bed and	486.8570707006745
almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men	488.8921727628084
of twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse. Now, here	399.6006072468001
we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that	351.3900693782054
he did not.	435.55816153825145
This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance	373.3624290896769
of his security. Before daybreak he would awake, leave the inn after	319.7845241637115
rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would, under	498.08065081332677
pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of some	329.3150889567886
peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet,	353.1204971428704
casting off the lion’s skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with	472.5350377071109
his hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden	394.44898620040317
comb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his	427.5570242065413
old comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the	495.33802396793396
wooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and	437.8195495349172
sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering	343.1170787291698
inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.	450.65298172518345
Once past the frontier, Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds;	336.4876643714108
and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about	435.44116653630357
with him in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of	484.9533228484298
about 50,000 livres, which he philosophically considered as no very	400.0144140931519
deplorable condition after all. Moreover, he reckoned much on the	311.3921325675967
interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own	325.72780655618703
misadventures. These were the reasons which, added to the fatigue,	376.35203073265745
caused Andrea to sleep so soundly. In order that he might wake early he	387.63700133405655
did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the door	381.0943325025211
and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose	482.8405949244156
temper he well knew, and which was never absent from him.	472.65998416477225
About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight,	306.5396202083908
which played, warm and brilliant, upon his face. In all well-organized	440.37103454640504
brains, the predominating idea—and there always is one—is sure to be	401.85404029518907
the last thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the	469.3560340082607
morning. Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating	490.93356775476286
idea presented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too	450.6062675391539
long. He jumped out of bed and ran to the window. A gendarme was	421.07335052998826
crossing the court. A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in	479.8787707083002
the world, even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a	414.16882816464187
timid conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white	447.53588477587766
uniform is really very alarming.	493.67791374886724
“Why is that gendarme there?” asked Andrea of himself.	442.9691765892665
Then, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has,	440.0275152947476
doubtless, remarked in him, “There is nothing astonishing in seeing a	372.2789664667653
gendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.”	339.0208814099587
And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had	338.02672344786265
failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had	361.097903271924
led in Paris.	343.2861211198041
“Now then,” said Andrea, while dressing himself, “I’ll wait till he	484.497410130394
leaves, and then I’ll slip away.”	351.01484679411806
50047m	392.0878932629653
And, saying this, Andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat,	307.80042287262614
stole gently to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin	433.68029375713024
curtain. Not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man	471.80160733160517
now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of	483.82958890766145
the staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third,	402.45474469916854
on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at	314.8026560232733
the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress. The	394.34842207501924
appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of	494.679233815383
curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the	459.8159463052132
entrance to the hotel.	398.6774416603837
“They’re after me!” was Andrea’s first thought. “_Diable!_”	324.2029370808228
A pallor overspread the young man’s forehead, and he looked around him	417.36147862203006
with anxiety. His room, like all those on the same floor, had but one	311.4592515258739
outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody. “I am lost!” was his	467.35575793026464
second thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea’s situation, an arrest	299.6561028325401
meant the assizes, trial, and death,—death without mercy or delay.	437.3577180589905
For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands, and	345.7474744172477
during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon a	477.43407013948206
ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his	410.0478710511528
mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks.	465.5351007548635
He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the	301.67236681632073
chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper. With forced composure	427.8975241428443
he dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a	498.62647760497623
sheet of paper:	398.6072530826359
“I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave	304.99809741771884
behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount. I shall be	376.94888931919974
excused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.”	362.31013262334204
He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper. This	396.34337165439183
done, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and	435.1658717514927
even placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting	319.6029731445807
to close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to	429.33586368040557
that kind of gymnastic exercise, after replacing the chimney-board,	347.8580560866711
which represented Achilles with Deidamia, and effacing the very marks	352.9565074146561
of his feet upon the ashes, he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel,	378.1817902139914
which afforded him the only means of escape left.	384.51339961391204
At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked	470.66498469636514
upstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the	359.7774408714211
second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by	374.7595213076827
the one stationed at the door.	439.19410077400664
Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. At	447.49757058011915
daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost	334.167516477381
immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost	473.071275731394
endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse. Compiègne, that royal	405.96014015216883
residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,	374.8678782906
gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations	427.3742190302887
as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle	318.2922592147457
being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed	359.1139954469993
their first inquiries there.	456.25895725540295
Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville,	403.3764772238655
which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others	308.0164817726959
that a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel	303.0990460456812
who was relieved at six o’clock in the morning, remembered perfectly	396.8053778123564
that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young	335.84322635881136
man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man,	485.21873534040185
having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel,	437.7225197055776
which was opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late	436.47620023928476
arrival had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other	390.03366128533906
than Andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed	463.072867351758
their steps towards his room. They found the door ajar.	427.10491213720144
“Oh, oh,” said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; “a	319.35507785981906
bad sign to find the door open! I would rather find it triply bolted.”	425.8481479111093
And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or	379.738996610573
rather corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled. We say	380.16179791193247
corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced	492.05808830751846
by a single proof. He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the	410.86139330304644
curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.	310.3023326085978
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the	458.48105071949294
ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be	383.54817184965367
passed over without serious investigation.	429.2411479320524
The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the	307.2523840435378
chimney with them, set a light to it. The fire crackled, and the smoke	330.0758285470092
ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell	390.49226807343814
down, as they expected. The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society	376.04001523993776
ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he	495.9899647044153
were advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the	339.14888295066874
fire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the	489.4187313971237
chimney-pots.	492.6778584272312
50049m	440.90399020003997
At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim	352.39824629663775
in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, “He is not here!” But venturing	355.2219648179564
to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as might	393.69255072444923
have been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching	407.22486904777827
with increased attention.	458.7914343235441
It was now his turn to look about him; the Hôtel de Ville, a massive	306.3572720999132
sixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from	435.306508711255
the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below,	483.4315038380841
and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at	449.9182739196566
one of these openings. If once discovered, he knew he would be lost,	392.6418638789726
for the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to	439.9777249013669
descend, not through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a	404.78180517375665
similar one conducting to another room.	407.2400666569479
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having	465.82916928945787
reached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by	334.98044440549586
anyone. At the same minute, one of the little windows of the Hôtel de	396.9925617560781
Ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared. For an	354.02187708686495
instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the	373.27962490215793
building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head	494.26107093902687
disappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he	477.7763238072349
represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand	442.75452108777546
questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.	381.02174767050434
“Well?” asked the two gendarmes.	385.5984624115579
“Well, my boys,” said the brigadier, “the brigand must really have	379.2035133327666
escaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets	373.30615659747207
and Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no	457.5783185870917
doubt.”	476.8672544642435
The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that	460.58535240993655
intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a	477.3990015599694
loud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded	310.8103926862692
through the court of the hotel.	404.5700342066514
“Ah, what is that?” cried the brigadier.	463.39381588024963
“Some traveller seems impatient,” said the host. “What number was it	490.14217659112927
that rang?”	492.6090668715266
“Number 3.”	337.7989270323422
“Run, waiter!”	392.26736529056
At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.	329.575142312396
“Aha!” said the brigadier, stopping the servant, “the person who is	338.05314081526643
ringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend	423.22047146882636
upon him with a gendarme. Who occupies Number 3?”	320.32458342914765
“The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his	353.22209238499755
sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.”	349.840895394891
The bell here rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.	330.91219829061635
“Follow me, Mr. Commissary!” said the brigadier; “tread in my steps.”	451.59561975333725
“Wait an instant,” said the host; “Number 3 has two staircases,—inside	319.22861941803086
and outside.”	338.62545520115503
“Good,” said the brigadier. “I will take charge of the inside one. Are	419.5189575649701
the carbines loaded?”	422.69405825578036
“Yes, brigadier.”	493.2412700833503
“Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon	330.8642983310821
him; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.”	426.6549264698322
The brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside	481.0435423853627
staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting	474.8942420108071
Andrea had excited in the crowd.	310.35824860714433
This is what had happened: Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend	328.61551553189435
two-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and	396.5408705911098
notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed	406.4577103641101
and noise than he intended. It would have signified little had the room	399.5372287369903
been empty, but unfortunately it was occupied. Two ladies, sleeping in	379.05619645257934
one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the	318.220918404908
spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man. One of these ladies,	391.94170608534387
the fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through	351.2177212071751
the house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope, rang with all her	466.27007203907567
strength. Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.	408.05922958571773
“For pity’s sake,” he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom	477.26310318430626
he was addressing,—“for pity’s sake do not call assistance! Save me!—I	407.9666662330733
will not harm you.”	450.78779472579106
“Andrea, the murderer!” cried one of the ladies.	307.78971439722216
“Eugénie! Mademoiselle Danglars!” exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.	489.05893336152917
“Help, help!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, taking the bell from her	445.219033378644
companion’s hand, and ringing it yet more violently.	389.1932097232209
“Save me, I am pursued!” said Andrea, clasping his hands. “For pity,	463.716673632813
for mercy’s sake do not deliver me up!”	339.7206000616467
“It is too late, they are coming,” said Eugénie.	452.9484156983906
“Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed;	421.61665955144537
you can turn their suspicions and save my life!”	463.21608352283636
50053m	424.60581196765514
The two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the	412.53497174234485
bedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating	360.5348958374159
voice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.	432.92026554649846
“Well, be it so,” at length said Eugénie; “return by the same road you	451.4129361891563
came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.”	387.3028329513747
“Here he is, here he is!” cried a voice from the landing; “here he is!	312.0201829856148
I see him!”	427.48072592731296
The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had discovered Andrea	425.52908324694556
in a posture of entreaty. A violent blow from the butt end of the	329.3881038330762
musket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts, and the	399.3769807056696
broken door fell in. Andrea ran to the other door, leading to the	451.54517760380014
gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood with	362.97278763627264
his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in his	356.3189184539424
clenched hand.	446.1099917468563
“Fly, then!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, whose pity returned as her	310.514093668084
fears diminished; “fly!”	443.26868198802737
“Or kill yourself!” said Eugénie (in a tone which a Vestal in the	303.4378271285685
amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to	480.6934967857225
finish his vanquished adversary). Andrea shuddered, and looked on the	323.7850523166496
young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood	318.4184192632531
such ferocious honor.	435.52272716829975
“Kill myself?” he cried, throwing down his knife; “why should I do so?”	341.5440225208478
“Why, you said,” answered Mademoiselle Danglars, “that you would be	438.92253701451705
condemned to die like the worst criminals.”	308.54880189501756
50055m	376.9822861097182
“Bah,” said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, “one has friends.”	454.2546126351809
The brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.	343.19840164378405
“Come, come,” said Andrea, “sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there	364.37868852290933
is no occasion to make such a fuss, since I give myself up;” and he	407.7130596626314
held out his hands to be manacled.	355.8860733340099
The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the	391.46632085553443
man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a	469.01974273528225
galley-slave. Andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile	350.08602499005184
asked, “Have you any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars,	419.85276148005386
for in all probability I shall return to Paris?”	366.05369991526123
Eugénie covered her face with her hands.	441.51376006701776
“Oh, oh!” said Andrea, “you need not be ashamed, even though you did	468.2977280366346
post after me. Was I not nearly your husband?”	493.82578639439555
50056m	341.0978677350309
And with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to	423.1876775574979
their own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour	425.4697154317589
after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.	419.4083109749972
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but	406.80634726082025
they were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of	490.7610806605768
curious glances and whispering voices.	380.1920163904681
Eugénie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear,	493.2828380483005
and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage.	485.76104280622695
“Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?” she exclaimed, throwing	335.6306021236974
herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d’Armilly, her eyes sparkling	339.3749795357724
with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world	358.71561666760715
had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow.	435.8290495706075
The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre, at Brussels. The	337.605988303671
same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.	455.1660392029199
 Chapter 99. The Law	401.82332591589693
We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle	477.30704260469355
d’Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being	404.0094487414274
that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think	372.3469758403858
of theirs.	488.8589318432996
We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his	476.89041773223414
debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who	491.4266919813551
after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had	481.56513627284136
struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray. The	366.3507480639024
baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her	334.0540899888473
of a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugénie’s character, could not	367.85517139166996
fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations	389.59975194394355
which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her	408.957584468293
ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom	479.22984486426645
and a type of perfection.	452.08370839456836
Now, Madame Danglars feared Eugénie’s sagacity and the influence of	377.32126573403355
Mademoiselle d’Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous	421.95959398270463
expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,—an expression	408.93066188925
which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother’s amorous and	468.21633044188536
pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw	338.7104295121237
that Eugénie detested Debray, not only because he was a source of	302.3284306922456
dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at	453.7881282452237
once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to	359.92673290793743
withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as	478.2536857952191
animals upon two legs without feathers.	341.9808072427114
Unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through	336.1561318055067
a certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as	392.5969787195131
others, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the	480.5406166080919
marriage of Eugénie had not taken place, not only because the match was	433.1574980316432
good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it	365.448391954243
would also set her at liberty. She ran therefore to Debray, who, after	425.327274113933
having, like the rest of Paris, witnessed the contract scene and the	461.6553861624012
scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was	466.6726827650691
chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of	441.447695944398
conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the	302.0995224203168
world.	455.44633926845654
At the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and	346.1729877904023
concealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray’s	387.9934067694246
apartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the	302.36438986094754
young man was not at home, Debray was occupied in repelling the	419.74255325860304
insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the	453.6751318236697
terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the	399.55421878973334
family, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions. Debray did	315.1553985195141
not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his	467.06443333872767
mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of	372.8379779945585
Eugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the	491.24707486639534
same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in	465.5507360416349
his heart. Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become	343.2868291552844
interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till	332.870655399197
one o’clock in the morning.	304.314571869676
Meanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of	308.91421521074693
Debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,	439.98705657291896
which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed,	417.0002546432818
Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his	311.8187222360504
absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.	335.5198926760659
At twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting,	375.80204839800626
returned home. Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes	483.64801109917664
in one respect, they seldom return home after twelve o’clock. The	460.8214918310747
baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in	483.7993864650936
leaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered	455.8948222111361
her apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugénie. She was	342.2602784889133
fearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter’s	380.954960175549
innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eugénie’s	412.1429744108763
door, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place.	465.06058501006567
Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome	315.8186992716613
with the terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to	371.9598650589041
sleep. She called the maid and questioned her.	377.81800682173684
“Mademoiselle Eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with	484.14114876237323
Mademoiselle d’Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they	351.82966849527475
desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.”	452.89896630468854
Since then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought	402.4519375042468
the young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore,	391.78754344860454
went to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the	445.6852530329718
recent events. In proportion as her memory became clearer, the	379.8762570153392
occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she	376.2187812056568
had taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as	314.0905270977159
something distressing, was in reality a disgrace. And then the baroness	303.31990983760903
remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès, who had been	383.0828412889807
afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son.	480.3619566545417
“Eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we. The affair, as	465.38141036892017
it will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as	435.04745063441055
ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound. How fortunate that	380.451154847272
Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made	452.59141846222707
me tremble!”	391.77155615832595
And her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious Providence	453.6183808991968
disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes	324.4936812775966
produces a blessing. And then her thoughts, cleaving through space like	450.0152266877231
a bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti. This Andrea was a wretch, a	411.8843265562818
robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort	432.96897803529293
of education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world	375.4284990709553
with the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable	468.3352260226508
name. How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth? To whom	350.30861562129627
would she apply to help her out of this painful situation? Debray, to	336.1021917174725
whom she had run, with the first instinct of a woman towards the man	481.1671254133797
she loves, and who yet betrays her,—Debray could but give her advice,	380.59453188409344
she must apply to someone more powerful than he.	307.6212590730579
The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort. It was M. de Villefort	375.7797954826036
who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though	346.2105350879778
they had been strangers. But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not	413.9113956844921
a merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties,	490.7601885975813
but the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the	491.1651115253747
very core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the	407.4647790823335
surgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious	409.06914974873564
association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the	436.3522995706384
world as their son-in-law. And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars,	439.1216887542685
had acted in this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously	324.6075934599808
acquainted with, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea’s intrigues.	467.6297258698529
Villefort’s conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the	324.9750101204333
baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage. But the inflexibility	398.1590712822984
of the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and	372.38164955833685
if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she	305.0010005808995
would, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow. She would	355.9097940201672
invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by	356.2302623343449
the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days. M. de Villefort would stifle	387.2930961546345
the affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea	402.7670707749492
to fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called	421.5925853368652
contempt of court. And after this reasoning she slept easily.	463.2691849585284
At nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her	338.46215365851765
maid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in	461.978567681159
the same simple style as on the previous night; then running	437.37776647880486
downstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a	313.4976442353448
cab, and drove to M. de Villefort’s house.	479.4056774021127
For the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy	475.00129178313716
appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague. Some of the	373.3618128068547
apartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only	307.916124196769
opened to admit a minute’s air, showing the scared face of a footman,	416.5508474179269
and immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a	315.5289221486641
gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each	323.18359669216625
other in a low voice, “Will there be another funeral today at the	348.92230882742825
procureur’s house?”	406.839621632957
Madame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the	467.27020092897544
mansion; descending from the cab, she approached the door with	410.98418018542355
trembling knees, and rang the bell. Three times did the bell ring with	429.275000403299
a dull, heavy sound, seeming to participate, in the general sadness,	401.31446989625636
before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door, which he	429.18214123218354
opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard. He saw a lady,	472.9902326532162
a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady, and yet the door remained almost	419.2982145984174
closed.	492.9288112996227
“Do you intend opening the door?” said the baroness.	468.5317984473354
“First, madame, who are you?”	367.78451887198435
“Who am I? You know me well enough.”	378.681836435888
“We no longer know anyone, madame.”	392.1576234501709
“You must be mad, my friend,” said the baroness.	354.09290825748036
“Where do you come from?”	485.138627216886
“Oh, this is too much!”	390.83367378129196
“Madame, these are my orders; excuse me. Your name?”	416.6291739756682
“The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times.”	437.1356726777003
“Possibly, madame. And now, what do you want?”	401.80253309269835
“Oh, how extraordinary! I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the	480.3126976736137
impertinence of his servants.”	452.5493877704928
“Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here	349.98784724934075
without an order from M. d’Avrigny, or without speaking to the	345.8019145170167
procureur.”	367.56177511822034
“Well, I have business with the procureur.”	371.1350177881962
“Is it pressing business?”	364.2485842830613
“You can imagine so, since I have not even brought my carriage out yet.	381.4450070900516
But enough of this—here is my card, take it to your master.”	398.6812694339893
“Madame will await my return?”	351.4965778714081
“Yes; go.”	493.8700342454526
The concierge closed the door, leaving Madame Danglars in the street.	494.05266218022683
She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide	446.4150335486711
enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again	442.9906686232019
shut. Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge took a	386.5364030768399
whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and blew it.	305.23405999151225
The valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps.	368.7072448989522
“You will excuse this poor fellow, madame,” he said, as he preceded the	421.97618549492256
baroness, “but his orders are precise, and M. de Villefort begged me to	366.3780902465859
tell you that he could not act otherwise.”	449.5894112259448
In the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been	392.6824933215347
admitted with the same precautions. The baroness ascended the steps;	332.3365761456585
she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to	331.27836972654325
magnify her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never	402.81802536225086
lost sight of her for an instant, she was introduced to the	401.74261743871887
magistrate’s study.	358.91957708724294
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit,	490.837040297195
the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so	486.22757406072253
insulting, that she began by complaining of it. But Villefort, raising	328.32032973386265
his head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile	358.76737728036005
that her complaints died upon her lips.	400.05201743937124
“Forgive my servants,” he said, “for a terror I cannot blame them for;	430.73679351278963
from being suspected they have become suspicious.”	471.8433254796904
Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate	348.62021505172703
alluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never	498.77185963968213
have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far.	479.6000079822354
“You too, then, are unhappy?” she said.	453.40281833675516
“Yes, madame,” replied the magistrate.	483.99075687357697
“Then you pity me!”	385.1822168923465
“Sincerely, madame.”	484.0514924912423
“And you understand what brings me here?”	338.96594393719346
“You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just	486.68051644399793
happened?”	389.06540794744814
“Yes, sir,—a fearful misfortune.”	467.41259652762966
“You mean a mischance.”	324.32761829783965
“A mischance?” repeated the baroness.	441.764558781251
“Alas, madame,” said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of	464.40163009573155
manner, “I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.”	416.404532186068
“And do you suppose this will be forgotten?”	422.3154851661445
“Everything will be forgotten, madame,” said Villefort. “Your daughter	398.253934325777
will be married tomorrow, if not today—in a week, if not tomorrow; and	420.38587757693676
I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter.”	404.32779413082034
Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort, stupefied to find him so almost	398.45458936630854
insultingly calm. “Am I come to a friend?” she asked in a tone full of	354.3268457933425
mournful dignity.	438.38628619786437
“You know that you are, madame,” said Villefort, whose pale cheeks	388.806457640757
became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance. And truly this	416.4378766681436
assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying	372.540988138018
the baroness and him.	396.7754375471859
“Well, then, be more affectionate, my dear Villefort,” said the	388.4189840563708
baroness. “Speak to me not as a magistrate, but as a friend; and when I	448.7645160676313
am in bitter anguish of spirit, do not tell me that I ought to be gay.”	414.0697795434194
Villefort bowed.	325.84699329219944
“When I hear misfortunes named, madame,” he said, “I have within the	470.80988808920137
last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own, and	429.65683276332413
then I cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind. That	308.3134902520917
is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me	323.5535605572896
mere mischances; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear	484.8630119496605
enviable. But this annoys you; let us change the subject. You were	443.8872020632849
saying, madame——”	381.9769806091936
“I came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done	417.899790359014
with this impostor?”	464.6066542845491
“Impostor,” repeated Villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to	386.1957810387323
extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others. Impostor, indeed!—M.	440.56976617610707
Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather M. Benedetto, is nothing more nor less	391.70412607058455
than an assassin!”	480.37244693722016
“Sir, I do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more	417.9176896934059
severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply	466.941943319624
will you strike our family. Come, forget him for a moment, and instead	309.51099467979884
of pursuing him, let him go.”	425.90649418517745
“You are too late, madame; the orders are issued.”	462.14316755812956
“Well, should he be arrested—do they think they will arrest him?”	310.9108488246875
“I hope so.”	313.4176885377873
“If they should arrest him (I know that sometimes prisons afford means	325.621269155286
of escape), will you leave him in prison?”	403.6778300372407
The procureur shook his head.	409.71394323109735
“At least keep him there till my daughter be married.”	314.74664170913996
“Impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.”	353.7416860678826
“What, even for me?” said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.	439.2573552739848
“For all, even for myself among the rest,” replied Villefort.	387.4296245791288
50063m	457.73893033406466
“Ah!” exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the	340.06389878827173
exclamation betrayed. Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance	456.5396274388546
which reads the secrets of the heart.	497.86585216413823
“Yes, I know what you mean,” he said; “you refer to the terrible rumors	320.4223327032164
spread abroad in the world, that the deaths which have kept me in	407.17133313824337
mourning for the last three months, and from which Valentine has only	323.75477577590965
escaped by a miracle, have not happened by natural means.”	340.1914945478113
“I was not thinking of that,” replied Madame Danglars quickly.	495.66171442623937
“Yes, you were thinking of it, and with justice. You could not help	360.7078923111302
thinking of it, and saying to yourself, ‘you, who pursue crime so	329.23198759499076
vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your	419.82615124659105
dwelling?’” The baroness became pale. “You were saying this, were you	474.3891177369162
not?”	389.0414627794037
“Well, I own it.”	486.77067262036564
“I will answer you.”	327.91574313449826
Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting	404.93000762487844
both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual:	471.3468245458855
“There are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are	443.37549781024944
unknown, and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but	447.70590622886266
when the culprits are discovered” (Villefort here extended his hand	339.61437366926003
toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)—“when they are	468.86781586432585
discovered, I swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever	322.6486648087344
they may be they shall die. Now, after the oath I have just taken, and	365.1705291662772
which I will keep, madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!”	435.89994978752543
“But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?”	462.7663966644476
“Listen; this is his description: ‘Benedetto, condemned, at the age of	311.8398968283317
sixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.’ He promised well,	306.36212365465843
as you see—first a runaway, then an assassin.”	449.23898376826696
“And who is this wretch?”	428.49497834343055
“Who can tell?—a vagabond, a Corsican.”	374.44143472913544
“Has no one owned him?”	333.601515204256
“No one; his parents are unknown.”	444.0769435621044
“But who was the man who brought him from Lucca?”	374.8505650761162
“Another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice.” The baroness	372.04521305138735
clasped her hands.	486.14998522341097
“Villefort,” she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner.	422.9437939782597
“For Heaven’s sake, madame,” said Villefort, with a firmness of	446.28894720764777
expression not altogether free from harshness—“for Heaven’s sake, do	393.0364937242381
not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch! What am I?—the law. Has the	490.375659259402
law any eyes to witness your grief? Has the law ears to be melted by	313.0573734926048
your sweet voice? Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections	394.20909065360917
you endeavor to recall? No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it	322.6863643018381
commands it strikes. You will tell me that I am a living being, and not	313.3748015085463
a code—a man, and not a volume. Look at me, madame—look around me. Has	438.2775277315385
mankind treated me as a brother? Have men loved me? Have they spared	312.3352011004123
me? Has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands?	496.850015292115
No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!	425.5550454953724
50065m	329.51343735026387
“Woman, siren that you are, do you persist in fixing on me that	478.72379190090584
fascinating eye, which reminds me that I ought to blush? Well, be it	468.88997944522674
so; let me blush for the faults you know, and perhaps—perhaps for even	315.7659327009427
more than those! But having sinned myself,—it may be more deeply than	450.8869352819065
others,—I never rest till I have torn the disguises from my	442.4564853304638
fellow-creatures, and found out their weaknesses. I have always found	465.8225266619679
them; and more,—I repeat it with joy, with triumph,—I have always found	425.5479160030668
some proof of human perversity or error. Every criminal I condemn seems	433.64525432330555
to me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the rest.	318.61635445500485
Alas, alas, alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike at	314.7814907460642
wickedness!”	465.79116919455055
Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave	390.9432163276471
a ferocious eloquence to his words.	430.05230852609515
“But”’ said Madame Danglars, resolving to make a last effort, “this	393.2625766240809
young man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody.”	426.2923927464011
“So much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so	326.0878598712513
ordained that he may have none to weep his fate.”	347.11027825834634
“But this is trampling on the weak, sir.”	446.27724712683244
“The weakness of a murderer!”	480.3186967689069
“His dishonor reflects upon us.”	387.4243165564609
“Is not death in my house?”	443.7413907910774
“Oh, sir,” exclaimed the baroness, “you are without pity for others,	363.0539376749858
well, then, I tell you they will have no mercy on you!”	479.3790209853415
“Be it so!” said Villefort, raising his arms to heaven with a	321.9483410593911
threatening gesture.	324.77013419410537
“At least, delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have	323.22899871813536
six months before us.”	479.47377253842876
“No, madame,” said Villefort; “instructions have been given. There are	395.17770830616814
yet five days left; five days are more than I require. Do you not think	453.5173785873227
that I also long for forgetfulness? While working night and day, I	388.0461353192219
sometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the	472.56471865433804
same sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better	329.1306594482862
than suffering.”	367.01940351206133
“But, sir, he has fled; let him escape—inaction is a pardonable	409.4776610719876
offence.”	360.9490530528967
“I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was	307.45832724551764
employed, and at this very minute——”	374.9091980907032
“Sir,” said the valet de chambre, entering the room, “a dragoon has	420.60644684571616
brought this despatch from the Minister of the Interior.”	340.9409664402623
Villefort seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame	361.1745800505816
Danglars trembled with fear; Villefort started with joy.	435.7577913412215
“Arrested!” he exclaimed; “he was taken at Compiègne, and all is over.”	400.3500879573761
Madame Danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.	380.4575096140237
“Adieu, sir,” she said.	459.0024794281844
“Adieu, madame,” replied the king’s attorney, as in an almost joyful	367.4574429177352
manner he conducted her to the door. Then, turning to his desk, he	403.4903870972204
said, striking the letter with the back of his right hand:	378.5699160028816
“Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and two cases of arson, I only	468.3866663067944
wanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a splendid session!”	363.69340495340344
 Chapter 100. The Apparition	312.0242756540173
As the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet	449.153366347902
recovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;	449.84698556558385
and it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,	494.57887253786924
that she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the	299.08671307804696
flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather	421.62669970995904
Benedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against	350.5954913974781
him. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the	435.3617027422765
same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	382.7665499734534
health. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and	431.07318238990206
confused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented	337.7676956020286
themselves before her eyes.	444.0395075106876
During the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,	326.20564335407437
owing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be	488.74232198023424
carried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal	341.53289415038506
tenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,	490.0865385693387
frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.	459.2172167909748
At six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny	423.724203468018
himself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young	341.2743757854564
girl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s	449.82531331271935
choice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,	414.74023665920606
when Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of	469.60179644011725
Valentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the	432.4234185348198
sick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little	454.22018707523046
Edward.	477.3997764695288
Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,	405.2353463969091
and, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.	388.23561085166364
Certainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous	309.52830172050324
excitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him	440.1046232821026
when, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she	469.7661037444626
were not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had	495.53982022670755
elapsed, and Valentine still lived.	404.7775540789532
The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her	466.9326412629309
sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking	404.00715430878756
hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from	408.53195818164966
the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass	306.21777100464726
and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with	402.2077058500099
their trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother	341.420983940036
threatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes	429.19236463238747
mere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even	419.5728662963708
the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and	354.8053619926218
this state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep,	466.35608257265835
heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake	436.9282695955695
till daylight.	472.9425499652175
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight	452.5035567516453
of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto,—Villefort having retired as	395.4092815722597
well as Noirtier and d’Avrigny,—her thoughts wandered in a confused	454.36805337011606
maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had	488.35186924893725
just heard.	459.64297954763094
Eleven o’clock had struck. The nurse, having placed the beverage	332.27849760246346
prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the	422.7613400356927
door, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the	350.69578004752714
kitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had	358.5539763722449
for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the	426.228247731088
house of the king’s attorney. Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing	406.4794650179364
in the room which had been so carefully locked.	330.9572615224513
Ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left; Valentine, who for	354.39475190637404
the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly,	482.22419342242756
incapable of controlling her ideas, was forced to yield to the	380.4136516746596
excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a	389.2175012410024
succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images. The	317.546145722249
night-lamp threw out countless rays, each resolving itself into some	308.25280837240206
strange form to her disordered imagination, when suddenly by its	498.4360992821349
flickering light Valentine thought she saw the door of her library,	362.28453474357417
which was in the recess by the chimney-piece, open slowly, though she	436.8180218244845
in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned.	412.860843883995
At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and	326.6027693975657
summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present	479.91688879564055
situation. Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but	498.87256418961584
the children of her imagination, and the conviction was strengthened by	365.2571485853202
the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal	395.6187517448834
phantoms, who disappeared with the coming of daylight.	331.48331495749215
From behind the door a human figure appeared, but the girl was too	465.60678903695725
familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only	495.007948250499
stared, hoping to recognize Morrel. The figure advanced towards the bed	448.97974758161286
and appeared to listen with profound attention. At this moment a ray of	302.78410709269195
light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor.	383.72165725145874
“It is not he,” she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this	393.40383451418063
was but a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form.	492.22198842832887
Still, she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she	305.71281985342074
remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to	423.85939573827136
drink, for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay	411.64647602419814
her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time	378.7011316896774
she suffered less. Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the	364.7282718300838
glass, but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition	388.50801644906954
advanced more quickly towards her, and approached the young girl so	474.23555199737905
closely that she fancied she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of	334.18820714355513
his hand.	410.48016732711835
This time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything	384.7254151631694
Valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really	401.79610623579265
alive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not	402.4779273624505
deceived made her shudder. The pressure she felt was evidently intended	491.5614991652498
to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it. Then the figure, from	369.1397690532409
whom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting	475.09387242872424
than menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held	407.59294797465424
it up, as if to test its transparency. This did not seem sufficient;	410.37727413730306
the man, or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was	409.6393638641348
heard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.	390.85743533368304
Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction. Every	319.42792609817457
minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another	439.66058452786797
vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again	460.147418225786
approached her, and said in an agitated voice, “Now you may drink.”	364.5467092842016
Valentine shuddered. It was the first time one of these visions had	417.2783043355611
ever addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an	329.66184654349735
exclamation. The man placed his finger on her lips.	315.2593369145923
“The Count of Monte Cristo!” she murmured.	354.45694628170054
It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl’s mind	413.27037218453927
as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands	418.93364478491554
trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her. Still, the	321.8042244872845
presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and	445.2098581261966
extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem	413.789027494282
impossibilities to her shattered reason.	341.1028675962687
“Do not call anyone—do not be alarmed,” said the count; “do not let a	407.6710544466415
shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast; the man	410.0432896252404
standing before you, Valentine (for this time it is no ghost), is	463.62101074483337
nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend	403.72117719789486
you could dream of.”	365.11606501620224
Valentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence	366.0479327299895
of a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a	463.39169139581173
syllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, “If your	436.4555785713827
intentions are pure, why are you here?” The count’s marvellous sagacity	324.5211657325831
understood all that was passing in the young girl’s mind.	358.10377015292653
“Listen to me,” he said, “or, rather, look upon me; look at my face,	336.0897711899253
paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days I	322.30433932214527
have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to	457.2979597711676
protect and preserve you for Maximilian.”	325.5786521305809
The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just	317.7634103312048
announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence	430.7301479027887
had inspired her.	386.24509457116636
“Maximilian!” she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her,	461.68118912380737
that she repeated it—“Maximilian!—has he then owned all to you?”	432.82057351328274
“Everything. He told me your life was his, and I have promised him that	489.0838876927733
you shall live.”	437.024221021456
“You have promised him that I shall live?”	415.60581854884595
“Yes.”	478.4678387421285
“But, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection. Are you a doctor?”	300.00642082071596
“Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.”	482.5162117713965
“But you say you have watched?” said Valentine uneasily; “where have	416.9252735676436
you been?—I have not seen you.”	463.5881438680406
The count extended his hand towards the library.	444.7845336581859
“I was hidden behind that door,” he said, “which leads into the next	404.5061331072908
house, which I have rented.”	456.4884656037482
Valentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of	411.21436298882475
pride and modest fear, exclaimed:	368.56607150200244
“Sir, I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and	302.9381565284613
that what you call protection is more like an insult.”	308.00789837823856
“Valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all I have	364.3201641370322
observed has been what people visited you, what nourishment was	437.11706640384796
prepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared	429.1243537611383
dangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the	450.2087628615361
place of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing	435.37772324925544
the death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.”	412.49278407527663
“Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the	488.1008131516463
influence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?”	441.9229931210715
50071m	449.49742582517615
“Hush, my child,” said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her	430.6438324273598
lips, “I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;” and the	365.54190632051314
count took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which	443.30580213965663
he poured a few drops into the glass. “Drink this, and then take	401.5491933115902
nothing more tonight.”	303.32525228175786
Valentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the	384.6602441142029
glass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the glass, drank	497.6199459065552
half its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who smiled and	334.7765829278625
swallowed the rest.	345.99330827341237
“Oh, yes,” she exclaimed, “I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal	437.4800003510455
beverage which refreshed me so much, and seemed to ease my aching	395.3071964031062
brain. Thank you, sir, thank you!”	473.10465101138254
“This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,”	391.66069227889454
said the count. “But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched	329.9431688105295
hours I have endured—the torture to which I have submitted when I saw	380.0420343751425
the deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you	466.8102876141442
should drink it before I could find time to throw it away!”	359.1631894991864
“Sir,” said Valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you	364.48846198507556
endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass;	423.26918076285796
but if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?”	397.65220083031676
“Yes.”	379.9474856517156
Valentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which	426.1744082271529
appeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with	329.4496657445354
the cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.	327.1781136158467
“You saw the person?” repeated the young girl.	442.31506430383257
“Yes,” repeated the count.	398.382157974555
“What you tell me is horrible, sir. You wish to make me believe	448.2805131726989
something too dreadful. What?—attempt to murder me in my father’s	448.24279378102506
house, in my room, on my bed of sickness? Oh, leave me, sir; you are	366.7288662990163
tempting me—you make me doubt the goodness of Providence—it is	338.5274112969931
impossible, it cannot be!”	417.1347607190731
“Are you the first that this hand has stricken? Have you not seen M. de	343.8109751442783
Saint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran, Barrois, all fall? Would not M.	442.33189335360663
Noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been	421.2885342518333
pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the	439.80152284419415
poison?”	458.26464694648314
“Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has	413.4613699683485
made me share all his beverages during the last month?”	380.21628161845734
“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of	482.2203175087936
dried orange-peel?”	438.89874648132763
“Oh, yes, yes!”	338.2372441154042
“Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo. “Your grandfather knows,	393.03489273471513
then, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.	460.6122474650489
He has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal	387.2713550162081
effects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already	378.61808878172167
impregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a	370.267888811067
more deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally	463.01339308213403
but too fatal.”	466.5236096312901
“But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?”	403.6802181611334
“Let me also ask you a question. Have you never seen anyone enter your	411.4707342836816
room at night?”	313.89606403692545
“Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach,	447.05377526452725
and disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish	444.1698091494634
imagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the	490.1260939585215
influence of delirium.”	324.2035673149927
“Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?”	323.53893705419364
50073m	336.5042746212182
“No,” said Valentine; “who could desire my death?”	460.2122199050701
“You shall know it now, then,” said Monte Cristo, listening.	381.39511151898273
“How do you mean?” said Valentine, looking anxiously around.	305.71208528523096
“Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight, but thoroughly	330.7940518926511
awake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose.”	436.93372746968004
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, wiping off the drops which ran down	473.2305776676688
her forehead. Midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to	420.1127721944051
strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl.	429.03504917776127
“Valentine,” said the count, “summon up all your courage; still the	365.17279755552937
beatings of your heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be	367.4621091657456
asleep; then you will see.”	484.4027457780163
Valentine seized the count’s hand. “I think I hear a noise,” she said;	382.01129833518445
“leave me.”	490.39442066526544
“Good-bye, for the present,” replied the count, walking upon tiptoe	468.25630728312433
towards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and	433.5117878489576
paternal that the young girl’s heart was filled with gratitude.	334.77095427811463
Before closing the door he turned around once more, and said, “Not a	401.3088716583559
movement—not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be	326.86529429741995
killed before I have the power of helping you.”	369.6996319672482
And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the	397.8340770482549
door, which noiselessly closed after him.	498.2937336931757
 Chapter 101. Locusta	331.45593214372667
Valentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of	446.7748810896999
Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different	372.3891070502467
directions, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was	316.2306593986006
silent. Then Valentine’s attention was engrossed by the clock in her	325.95090912104126
room, which marked the seconds. She began counting them, remarking that	455.6209633524237
they were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she	330.4679741106429
doubted,—the inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should	486.9286588814481
desire her death. Why should they? To what end? What had she done to	405.82156520243166
excite the malice of an enemy?	423.0732009464265
There was no fear of her falling asleep. One terrible idea pressed upon	347.12158113197506
her mind,—that someone existed in the world who had attempted to	319.24565256987654
assassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again.	311.87701021863734
Supposing this person, wearied at the inefficacy of the poison, should,	339.3382997048548
as Monte Cristo intimated, have recourse to steel!—What if the count	465.402607046737
should have no time to run to her rescue!—What if her last moments were	376.4719443628344
approaching, and she should never again see Morrel!	498.7955726613396
When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself, Valentine was	374.62400676278213
nearly persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help. But through the	351.15137897534703
door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count—that eye which	381.27304165565107
lived in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much	303.15251846642224
shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever	471.49649051901764
repay his adventurous and devoted friendship.	485.4992438670451
Twenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more, and	480.0260497758446
at last the clock struck the half-hour.	404.7061576078212
Just then the sound of finger-nails slightly grating against the door	463.3497786736822
of the library informed Valentine that the count was still watching,	364.6942495236724
and recommended her to do the same; at the same time, on the opposite	476.6932245319788
side, that is towards Edward’s room, Valentine fancied that she heard	304.8938658533589
the creaking of the floor; she listened attentively, holding her breath	401.86230239031676
till she was nearly suffocated; the lock turned, and the door slowly	486.2492121431087
opened. Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely	306.3657617267181
time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm;	446.6352729043384
then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable	467.36370386710377
terror, she awaited the event.	444.59368107056696
Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine	363.5213767116199
summoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which	415.0872387588223
announces tranquil sleep.	309.68896167888846
“Valentine!” said a low voice.	370.3676589136461
The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.	495.57951107299834
“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.	325.9481615941746
Still silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was	350.08906569803617
still, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of	408.3427672150108
some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she	375.30234236166416
ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw	484.8078907557003
a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her	441.64577358433166
glass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or	487.24069553815946
moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and	434.731078879635
leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine	448.1426432616961
slept: it was Madame de Villefort.	361.07753007079606
On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,	337.97627126025236
which caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly	357.55517380561514
stepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,	372.059738261735
she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of	491.1519771555964
Valentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;	385.0538943569264
she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp	320.8851898173452
knife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself	327.56545988457657
to close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate	332.1635106477203
organs of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost	366.84411831050795
impossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the	312.21186409832933
eyelid open and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however,	476.18161237670364
reassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular	324.9944303909982
breathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the	412.8893080430901
curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the	349.0686767044036
glass. Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had	316.35721187935974
left the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair	441.7275332567676
round arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread	484.04572308526195
death around her.	391.2200852887887
50077m	421.0408944953096
It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine	353.81856336636133
during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.	380.80029077335917
The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the	446.04773060519034
stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to	482.7372077344902
insensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door	463.93475458330124
again turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.	420.93473440210994
“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?”	446.9472982395599
“Oh,” murmured the young girl.	366.196312764265
“Have you seen?”	317.605790899716
“Alas!”	352.0442986390359
“Did you recognize?” Valentine groaned.	447.09459452917
“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!”	475.97580896521833
“Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian’s death?”	414.1217275460011
“Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the	472.6705745608758
house?—can I not escape?”	401.0281471006751
“Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you	313.37207330363265
everywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be	379.2262728104372
offered to you disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water	391.5392875197909
you drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.”	416.96405922713217
“But did you not say that my kind grandfather’s precaution had	453.2053807273427
neutralized the poison?”	365.15729974068154
“Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and	399.3431583143383
the quantity increased.” He took the glass and raised it to his lips.	316.0152669618744
“It is already done,” he said; “brucine is no longer employed, but a	317.419900134843
simple narcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it	436.9129303465138
has been dissolved. If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has	328.67303078614475
poured into your glass, Valentine—Valentine—you would have been	473.4735830012804
doomed!”	481.1932391030904
“But,” exclaimed the young girl, “why am I thus pursued?”	397.4444514940609
“Why?—are you so kind—so good—so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot	393.8188964831925
understand, Valentine?”	331.383129995509
“No, I have never injured her.”	391.18823877900456
“But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you	416.78072219096646
prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.”	442.1379145245777
“How so? The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my	458.7023519201264
relations.”	462.8881688779252
“Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died;	310.3431934677056
that is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir;	399.20379214842416
that is why you, in your turn, are to die—it is because your father	421.77343204634013
would inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to	407.1958774687778
his.”	342.33389028133547
“Edward? Poor child! Are all these crimes committed on his account?”	416.4648043586701
“Ah, then you at length understand?”	329.7616818119892
“Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!”	341.2568699354203
“Valentine, you are an angel!”	445.8389895331113
“But why is my grandfather allowed to live?”	320.113334862942
“It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert	356.22151640283977
to your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime	489.3398160248937
appearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.”	399.29707466572927
“And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been	428.99043048004165
invented by a woman?”	429.5973705228093
“Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hôtel des Postes, at Perugia,	431.9765901489062
seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning	308.8737104686825
upon _aqua tofana_? Well, ever since then, the infernal project has	467.9891505377421
been ripening in her brain.”	466.6459178284427
“Ah, then, indeed, sir,” said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, “I see	440.5535297891613
that I am condemned to die!”	337.9448128104027
“No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is	409.29854986006126
conquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine—live to be	340.94387784817286
happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to	393.13205938681415
insure this you must rely on me.”	404.60873143806754
“Command me, sir—what am I to do?”	352.77360782788725
“You must blindly take what I give you.”	341.18887309489446
“Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!”	475.2362202667374
“You must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.”	362.86781078378783
“My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?” asked	498.7090031995191
Valentine, clasping her hands.	357.42615635453944
“No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations,	406.1322975657135
ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally;	490.7054496368325
it is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my	428.0454540296074
place—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against	361.27587160158356
the assassin. Spectre against spectre!” he murmured in a low voice, as	358.21065229085195
he concluded his sentence.	481.3962384147249
“Sir,” said Valentine, “I will do all I can to live, for there are two	428.6679991922823
beings who love me and will die if I die—my grandfather and	483.50031687813686
Maximilian.”	494.87231718540386
“I will watch over them as I have over you.”	306.2052169229472
“Well, sir, do as you will with me;” and then she added, in a low	437.24577962367255
voice, “oh, heavens, what will befall me?”	417.92133034071173
“Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer;	339.99775738532696
though you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though you	427.2806861923327
should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear; even	317.16373629376676
though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.	309.8715817317277
Reassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: ‘At this moment, a	323.01116569827235
friend, a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian,	495.50802680704686
watches over me!’”	313.8891396185519
“Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!”	360.90979459895766
“Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?”	494.9446564696584
“I would rather die a hundred times—oh, yes, die!”	373.1995146694611
“No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that	412.4702107762892
you will not complain, but hope?”	447.3925845214071
“I will think of Maximilian!”	465.4336041006522
“You are my own darling child, Valentine! I alone can save you, and I	423.87487157370924
will.”	400.5038037078656
Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,—for she felt	320.4023863791847
that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,—and began to pray, and	478.60521052471347
while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her	427.1043230820761
white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and that the	431.17225996836316
pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her	431.9564996200305
nightdress. Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl’s arm,	392.795115322435
drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat, and said with a paternal	326.3331003159273
smile:	420.63149557068976
“My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness	489.1396527704093
of Providence and the love of Maximilian.” Valentine gave him a look	455.20722774441555
full of gratitude, and remained as docile as a child.	316.3871013996735
Then he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised	300.3935669946324
the golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea,	391.64245527437475
which he placed in her hand. She took it, and looked attentively on the	387.03354739914835
count; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector	320.0320158996544
which commanded her veneration. She evidently interrogated him by her	466.75841607897587
look.	447.0717635326129
“Yes,” said he.	309.5321380005786
Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it.	450.8127189760288
“And now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try and gain a	309.99250326625935
little sleep, for you are saved.”	423.65800622927327
“Go,” said Valentine, “whatever happens, I promise you not to fear.”	371.51847729823965
Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who	432.05827511827374
gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the	460.42104498215747
count had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the	398.8520112308364
contents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had	435.8905820809489
taken it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after	452.09960066818576
throwing a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence	469.0871945127808
and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord.	373.81703904003484
 Chapter 102. Valentine	317.872173692133
The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the	490.8220370686154
last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe	419.9075505847133
of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening	345.79097441048407
before it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate	353.50050701807197
object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human	347.4109242069023
creature in its final agonies. A dull and dismal light was shed over	344.4284866217046
the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl. All noise in	484.84871183687187
the streets had ceased, and the silence was frightful.	411.8090714650307
It was then that the door of Edward’s room opened, and a head we have	452.7518908718788
before noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was Madame de	388.5505339097715
Villefort, who came to witness the effects of the drink she had	415.99764235466307
prepared. She stopped in the doorway, listened for a moment to the	349.64548530327886
flickering of the lamp, the only sound in that deserted room, and then	324.08610662612244
advanced to the table to see if Valentine’s glass were empty. It was	366.5038341377581
still about a quarter full, as we before stated. Madame de Villefort	379.4882778984547
emptied the contents into the ashes, which she disturbed that they	355.4104038596671
might the more readily absorb the liquid; then she carefully rinsed the	480.7627145069247
glass, and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table.	375.93435007882874
If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have	377.90572695150604
noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the	401.2696984407344
bed and looked fixedly on Valentine. The dim light, the profound	484.9139702209809
silence, and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more	351.45818328459256
by her own conscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the	406.0678016457387
poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work.	303.769388890656
At length she rallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the	487.74878284995896
pillow gazed intently on Valentine. The young girl no longer breathed,	489.58045588233426
no breath issued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no	409.7821137251442
longer quivered—the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the	377.7955122813745
long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax. Madame de Villefort	384.9564749011604
gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she	448.95159459370194
ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl’s	342.13997279578575
heart. It was cold and motionless. She only felt the pulsation in her	434.8515434406379
own fingers, and withdrew her hand with a shudder. One arm was hanging	428.750201583055
out of the bed; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of	301.24860179522153
Germain Pillon’s “Graces,”23 but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly	455.13819886936375
distorted by convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was	390.63803624687444
resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed.	336.9777261983685
The nails, too, were turning blue.	430.548856350298
Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt; all was over—she had	467.3397209452978
consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish. There was no	383.167036490429
more to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though	462.8981127598546
fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she	345.18861988725956
still held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction	341.04875304141444
always exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely	410.25421597241194
mysterious and does not excite disgust.	412.9163513025487
The minutes passed; Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain	356.24466800512835
which she held like a funeral pall over the head of Valentine. She was	418.6070879116853
lost in reverie, and the reverie of crime is remorse.	423.33233131768066
Just then the lamp again flickered; the noise startled Madame de	409.9891226428119
Villefort, who shuddered and dropped the curtain. Immediately	493.2518304117737
afterwards the light expired, and the room was plunged in frightful	389.0265979864982
obscurity, while the clock at that minute struck half-past four.	355.2778094871254
Overpowered with agitation, the poisoner succeeded in groping her way	436.4924896764436
to the door, and reached her room in an agony of fear. The darkness	349.2113316114517
lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept through the	330.8206097045972
Venetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in the room.	472.17600051660804
About this time the nurse’s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman	394.2001200304335
entered the room with a cup in her hand. To the tender eye of a father	479.43466812340955
or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine’s	377.1968717515547
condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to sleep.	489.5970436082939
“Good,” she exclaimed, approaching the table, “she has taken part of	427.17499416313547
her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.”	485.01994604537543
Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she had	474.39148482680304
just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by	477.5840113874034
Valentine’s sleep, so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a	366.4889240384906
little more rest. The clock striking eight awoke her. Astonished at the	314.72223563859995
prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm	313.98009928832937
was still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and	368.0828836759821
for the first time noticed the white lips. She tried to replace the	390.95165718044154
arm, but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a	421.5365630758349
sick-nurse. She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed:	371.6678159989656
“Help, help!”	342.6586020905223
50083m	309.5085687211184
“What is the matter?” asked M. d’Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it	348.5167950301974
being the hour he usually visited her.	350.42109439666467
“What is it?” asked Villefort, rushing from his room. “Doctor, do you	477.75305286839455
hear them call for help?”	371.9940143439113
“Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine’s room.”	399.29249606220833
But before the doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants	311.6926048738847
who were on the same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and	347.04938568278965
motionless on her bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and	364.49128980883336
stood transfixed, as though struck by lightening.	421.8953507575078
“Call Madame de Villefort!—Wake Madame de Villefort!” cried the	493.9803575381645
procureur from the door of his chamber, which apparently he scarcely	405.2254609366413
dared to leave. But instead of obeying him, the servants stood watching	406.5678379642018
M. d’Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised her in his arms.	384.1164237871001
“What?—this one, too?” he exclaimed. “Oh, where will be the end?”	352.8947759242806
Villefort rushed into the room.	463.60827813888625
“What are you saying, doctor?” he exclaimed, raising his hands to	412.7763266529413
heaven.	361.6645643394873
“I say that Valentine is dead!” replied d’Avrigny, in a voice terrible	483.68351481782827
in its solemn calmness.	480.1855547133675
50085m	317.4857070447937
M. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed. On the	396.92835648479974
exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all	395.5351089691506
fled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the	448.47239633464557
stairs and through the long passages, then there was a rush in the	425.40010135525404
court, afterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the	321.2655999619744
accursed house.	440.0226407152678
Just then, Madame de Villefort, in the act of slipping on her	485.2587797536801
dressing-gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood	444.82411570088016
motionless, as though interrogating the occupants of the room, while	494.18628471533805
she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears. On a sudden she	328.74987820649915
stepped, or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table.	492.68022715113256
She saw d’Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain	455.9055140956971
of having emptied during the night. It was now a third full, just as it	416.8954307879116
was when she threw the contents into the ashes. The spectre of	498.07570802883333
Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less. It	316.5259681386926
was, indeed, the same color as the draught she had poured into the	421.2260625885582
glass, and which Valentine had drunk; it was indeed the poison, which	466.5720713507119
could not deceive M. d’Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it	339.3761142399395
was doubtless a miracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her	441.61682689875903
precautions, there should be some trace, some proof remaining to reveal	445.14111268748877
the crime.	444.069373398528
While Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of	400.352676753993
terror, and Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw	483.4766675024358
nothing around him, d’Avrigny approached the window, that he might the	471.4631633960515
better examine the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his	314.172010573596
finger in, tasted it.	321.1025844018293
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “it is no longer brucine that is used; let me see	477.2350653200972
what it is!”	343.6504807516003
Then he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine’s room, which had been	452.10939438157016
transformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a	477.0555196621324
small bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor,	369.8073940067625
which immediately changed to a blood-red color.	371.114512655182
“Ah,” exclaimed d’Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge	336.35974003636306
unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a	374.17110778425956
discovery.	404.9861583597048
Madame de Villefort was overpowered; her eyes first flashed and then	410.86770497908645
swam, she staggered towards the door and disappeared. Directly	448.0401464621351
afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground	357.5417020775965
was heard, but no one paid any attention to it; the nurse was engaged	314.0549897497433
in watching the chemical analysis, and Villefort was still absorbed in	323.8403848043088
grief. M. d’Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his	341.80813158542907
eyes, and watched her hurried retreat. He lifted up the drapery over	331.53697506887005
the entrance to Edward’s room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de	343.8157428046969
Villefort’s apartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor.	391.69009368362555
“Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort,” he said to the nurse.	348.28990944614793
“Madame de Villefort is ill.”	382.31649559367406
50087m	363.8945486380944
“But Mademoiselle de Villefort——” stammered the nurse.	365.37089643325214
“Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help,” said d’Avrigny,	450.92954187495417
“since she is dead.”	480.60210153168924
“Dead,—dead!” groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which	400.8631930480731
was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron	404.13428330167056
heart of that man.	410.61813487069537
“Dead!” repeated a third voice. “Who said Valentine was dead?”	343.0355420333242
The two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and	367.7133027300856
terror-stricken. This is what had happened. At the usual time, Morrel	407.6501422022243
had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier’s room.	398.67478358959136
Contrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring	420.9649370051404
he entered. He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant	380.5952945972813
to conduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants	332.801392334712
having, as we know, deserted the house. Morrel had no particular reason	435.00067731548324
for uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should	460.65786670609634
live, and so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the	394.9755946196565
count had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by	354.7505333595003
Noirtier. Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and	460.5484213564447
he called a second and third time; still no answer. Then he determined	407.9326143452423
to go up. Noirtier’s room was opened, like all the rest. The first	443.58671972144714
thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual	312.3013364143764
place, but his eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor	337.1298006666257
which overspread his features.	426.9053799197386
“How are you, sir?” asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart.	338.1257703405622
“Well,” answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance	340.1468098337176
manifested increasing uneasiness.	473.44530385391926
“You are thoughtful, sir,” continued Morrel; “you want something; shall	419.4740040334339
I call one of the servants?”	363.22610909488117
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.	358.1551851628236
Morrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one	454.83315485387124
answered. He turned towards Noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed	317.37725891946855
on his countenance momentarily increased.	426.4532928708353
“Oh,” exclaimed Morrel, “why do they not come? Is anyone ill in the	312.9210701073071
house?” The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from	406.08439501999453
their sockets. “What is the matter? You alarm me. Valentine?	357.7745737464573
Valentine?”	399.0843894838946
“Yes, yes,” signed Noirtier.	359.5582244816768
Maximilian tried to speak, but he could articulate nothing; he	457.68737220654907
staggered, and supported himself against the wainscot. Then he pointed	347.03083928046107
to the door.	322.0556240771998
“Yes, yes, yes!” continued the old man.	370.12160433973685
50089m	469.680091466709
Maximilian rushed up the little staircase, while Noirtier’s eyes seemed	479.1270810223192
to say,—“Quicker, quicker!”	443.85999563827124
In a minute the young man darted through several rooms, till at length	390.6047682922999
he reached Valentine’s.	330.83958247220244
There was no occasion to push the door, it was wide open. A sob was the	446.5008384322327
only sound he heard. He saw as though in a mist, a black figure	394.5137710646177
kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery. A terrible	395.32619367008226
fear transfixed him. It was then he heard a voice exclaim “Valentine is	450.3036021640527
dead!” and another voice which, like an echo repeated:	333.84470638196655
“Dead,—dead!”	493.1251128979061
50090m	427.309377985865
 Chapter 103. Maximilian	359.81371410745675
Villefort rose, half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of	447.38070540756286
grief. The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had	309.425243444295
succeeded in making him more or less than man. His glance, at first	383.0378040244502
wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel. “Who are you, sir,” he asked,	361.2432263923187
“that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with	376.2863313260942
death? Go, sir, go!”	372.651884824526
But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that	425.66899195903704
disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on	333.80239234420566
it.	349.44710430252843
“Go!—do you hear?” said Villefort, while d’Avrigny advanced to lead	364.03661815410726
Morrel out. Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse, gazed all	412.66547169545714
around the room, then upon the two men; he opened his mouth to speak,	336.2153479451792
but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas	424.14575937012444
that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his hands through his	492.24058818126605
hair in such a manner that Villefort and d’Avrigny, for a moment	488.719240352293
diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances, which seemed to	433.2659006382644
say,—“He is mad!”	381.03243036780304
But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an	329.19653422710724
extraordinary weight. Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman	399.7220982327741
strength, the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs. When he reached	305.65885197784127
the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it	327.3297194573149
into Valentine’s room. This could only have been accomplished by means	464.1738586266561
of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement. But the most	399.50727322349144
fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face	463.64419562418834
expressing all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every	373.598540484502
other faculty. That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort	355.36339356460917
like a frightful apparition. Each time he had been brought into contact	406.02242060888716
with his father, something terrible had happened.	377.6173218716334
“See what they have done!” cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the	473.0001118930307
back of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine. “See, my	443.31762787272464
father, see!”	488.08702408083843
Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,	313.19700264479064
almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father. At this moment	437.9270335441422
the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became	399.8564807170735
bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples	488.03482390856425
became purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was	419.43471955573915
wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry. And the cry issued	492.17470877387905
from his pores, if we may thus speak—a cry frightful in its silence.	349.21703738803313
D’Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful	384.10093346795026
restorative.	479.5424737678092
“Sir,” cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, “they ask	453.8782116814489
me who I am, and what right I have to be here. Oh, you know it, tell	433.1848896907019
them, tell them!” And the young man’s voice was choked by sobs.	321.79170567809865
As for the old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. One	378.53607529155704
could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.	467.33997903843556
At length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping,	375.0039698787282
tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.	300.3045109100442
“Tell them,” said Morrel in a hoarse voice, “tell them that I am her	460.9875530724455
betrothed. Tell them she was my beloved, my noble girl, my only	303.288636172603
blessing in the world. Tell them—oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to	306.46728126639584
me!”	408.73768290321397
The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily on	359.6919992166779
his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive	312.05535059042376
energy. D’Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion,	443.09644154918374
turned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further explanation,	312.8146561239478
and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us	424.2841698211958
towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn, extended his	382.66779198776334
hand towards the young man.	470.62488795345007
But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the hand of Valentine, and	402.4250579749769
unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets. For	323.1693577346824
some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs, exclamations, and	396.62052699354905
prayers. At length Villefort, the most composed of all, spoke:	447.23602057993287
“Sir,” said he to Maximilian, “you say you loved Valentine, that you	438.8298064120662
were betrothed to her. I knew nothing of this engagement, of this love,	392.4487465157304
yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that your grief is real and	361.7451652858691
deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place	322.5982262389585
in my heart. But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left	315.93115487713453
this earth—she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men. Take a	445.63853851150895
last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to	437.50627862564284
possess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her	310.7123574326433
forever. Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest.”	451.8795154892599
50093m	489.27868307933045
“You are mistaken, sir,” exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on one knee,	408.5623469555817
his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt—“you	366.73154021087566
are mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest,	353.35893980441483
but an avenger. _You_, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; _I_ will	459.1915938192827
be the avenger.”	315.9131748826738
“What do you mean, sir?” asked Villefort, trembling at the new idea	417.30538107706275
inspired by the delirium of Morrel.	361.3071960404779
“I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned	340.40110914970694
sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.”	394.0731682301822
The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d’Avrigny approached.	319.5540845903824
“Gentlemen,” said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of	369.26043417972295
the witnesses to the scene, “I know what I am saying, and you know as	458.68974129107494
well as I do what I am about to say—Valentine has been assassinated!”	484.27556307437715
Villefort hung his head, d’Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said	441.337276415508
“Yes” with his eyes.	378.51773395427654
“Now, sir,” continued Morrel, “in these days no one can disappear by	484.5811831453233
violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her	439.84714184926327
disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful, and adorable	332.70408545897504
creature like Valentine. Now, M. le Procureur du Roi,” said Morrel with	495.3216567718248
increasing vehemence, “no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is	447.1354361648175
your place to seek the assassin.”	363.63993421204935
The young man’s implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his	331.64521441386
side, glanced from Noirtier to d’Avrigny. But instead of finding	323.8451232992287
sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father, he only saw an	407.7610745025599
expression as inflexible as that of Maximilian.	350.5961440815742
“Yes,” indicated the old man.	478.5970010924802
“Assuredly,” said d’Avrigny.	460.85122232237734
“Sir,” said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force	369.57110346181514
and his own emotion,—“sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes	483.4417369648837
here. I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed, but no one	327.0215443352214
assassinates.”	353.1611713631738
The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d’Avrigny prepared to	370.5018164744149
speak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence.	456.38579981883277
“And I say that murders _are_ committed here,” said Morrel, whose	317.5896016184101
voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: “I	391.39698504610885
tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months. I	472.2479169341965
tell you, Valentine’s life was attempted by poison four days ago,	483.3376411625952
though she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier. I tell you	425.0303250480829
that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time	334.0021430534839
it has succeeded. I tell you that you know these things as well as I	338.8308287548926
do, since this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a	496.02680080074146
friend.”	495.7110864516329
“Oh, you rave, sir,” exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape	311.0731407010626
the net in which he was taken.	471.2328086594231
50095m	364.1320045322098
“I rave?” said Morrel; “well, then, I appeal to M. d’Avrigny himself.	464.48860091014757
Ask him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of	473.6666022386413
this house on the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death. You thought	304.56039809247255
yourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the	455.68370795403314
fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of	479.1041846806503
Valentine.” Villefort and d’Avrigny exchanged looks.	424.13739104298594
“Yes, yes,” continued Morrel; “recall the scene, for the words you	442.0799837302061
thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.	312.7986163649908
Certainly, after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de	467.9541362771579
Villefort towards his own relations, I ought to have denounced him to	484.502927632719
the authorities; then I should not have been an accomplice to thy	446.25856953523214
death, as I now am, sweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall	391.25966223637306
become the avenger. This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy	458.0737705487551
father abandon thee, Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall	468.5589227899154
pursue the assassin.”	336.749900770833
And this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the	334.66875398851136
vigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of	428.116806893752
Morrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so	312.46021491964535
long rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on	430.0010990878334
his knees by the side of the bed.	473.4834187309964
Then d’Avrigny spoke. “And I, too,” he exclaimed in a low voice, “I	418.6655583539974
unite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at	493.19026711607273
the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.”	493.0767762533111
“Oh, merciful Heavens!” murmured Villefort. Morrel raised his head, and	439.34716236046313
reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural lustre,—	387.3139096006833
“Stay,” he said, “M. Noirtier wishes to speak.”	317.9117692990089
“Yes,” indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from	463.1009318231803
all his faculties being centred in his glance.	494.0791689803161
“Do you know the assassin?” asked Morrel.	422.83900761207
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.	303.0105888476009
“And will you direct us?” exclaimed the young man. “Listen, M.	347.36758678887225
d’Avrigny, listen!”	409.369714723126
Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which	422.9674696938928
had so often made Valentine happy, and thus fixed his attention. Then,	414.0038687468481
having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own, he glanced	498.7769043997198
towards the door.	447.7846671701209
“Do you wish me to leave?” said Morrel, sadly.	464.82613780911004
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.	396.1950371210611
“Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!”	448.4323838479366
The old man’s eyes remained fixed on the door.	491.5151441633607
“May I, at least, return?” asked Morrel.	326.31584444437834
“Yes.”	374.1703633489445
“Must I leave alone?”	396.69848027486
“No.”	478.4589751310757
“Whom am I to take with me? The procureur?”	339.5486637469585
“No.”	470.6253702528319
“The doctor?”	415.61158106412853
“Yes.”	486.02430797827566
“You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort?”	384.42860332379246
“Yes.”	354.04350403966083
“But can he understand you?”	492.4831423244301
“Yes.”	471.017538327116
“Oh,” said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the	299.10778517388843
inquiries were to be made by him alone,—“oh, be satisfied, I can	456.7206867173121
understand my father.” While uttering these words with this expression	443.81301526106756
of joy, his teeth clashed together violently.	378.8333834484972
D’Avrigny took the young man’s arm, and led him out of the room. A more	487.3660618908147
than deathlike silence then reigned in the house. At the end of a	322.47700159217953
quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort	362.59268130075947
appeared at the door of the apartment where d’Avrigny and Morrel had	365.42855664467714
been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.	388.395486653381
“You can come,” he said, and led them back to Noirtier.	343.3534982552452
Morrel looked attentively on Villefort. His face was livid, large drops	426.42180529891806
rolled down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a	317.8396227941218
quill pen which he had torn to atoms.	423.2612325118199
“Gentlemen,” he said in a hoarse voice, “give me your word of honor	306.5530578949727
that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst	487.83292695408113
ourselves!” The two men drew back.	414.38252014825446
“I entreat you——” continued Villefort.	377.34371899526775
“But,” said Morrel, “the culprit—the murderer—the assassin.”	322.8894202738992
“Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,” said Villefort. “My	394.5626836523436
father has revealed the culprit’s name; my father thirsts for revenge	496.7240743532959
as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this	379.8935819294648
secret. Do you not, father?”	366.7870237379178
“Yes,” resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an exclamation of	349.18483738251416
horror and surprise to escape him.	332.7317119460977
“Oh, sir,” said Villefort, arresting Maximilian by the arm, “if my	356.30508292916096
father, the inflexible man, makes this request, it is because he knows,	327.75211665429873
be assured, that Valentine will be terribly revenged. Is it not so,	376.2699200156119
father?”	474.9801201764918
The old man made a sign in the affirmative. Villefort continued:	401.5116056672591
“He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him. Rest assured,	414.9614417368418
gentlemen, that within three days, in a less time than justice would	343.44845779470273
demand, the revenge I shall have taken for the murder of my child will	402.89315993290444
be such as to make the boldest heart tremble;” and as he spoke these	322.73902774374574
words he ground his teeth, and grasped the old man’s senseless hand.	404.80726130652573
“Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?” asked Morrel, while	366.50128189879615
d’Avrigny looked inquiringly.	413.08469150967494
“Yes,” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.	475.831394544344
“Swear, then,” said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and	372.19486842794
d’Avrigny, “swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave	377.2290140816351
me to avenge my child.”	440.59227725302515
D’Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “Yes,” but Morrel,	462.2990246769697
disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after having pressed the	470.4879575053638
cold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left, uttering a long,	338.82901040748675
deep groan of despair and anguish.	359.7421781199895
We have before stated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort	480.8365985357058
was therefore obliged to request M. d’Avrigny to superintend all the	323.13330710376107
arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a	389.30498633455807
death under such suspicious circumstances.	497.72043775329365
It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair	383.4538035394324
of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort	461.54200974512554
retired to his study, and d’Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the	471.06305287989073
mayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who	299.09340765894916
is expressly named “the doctor of the dead.” M. Noirtier could not be	334.4910993207038
persuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.	371.85900662303607
d’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate	425.9766429958156
closed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was	430.99257574563205
obliged to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the	488.95691216579826
courage to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore,	483.8732069021303
entered the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless,	391.58682454457045
and silent as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the	394.460765641908
indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the	467.12829931884426
dead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just	305.17983041477186
unclosed the lips.	299.23912633322647
“Alas,” said d’Avrigny, “she is indeed dead, poor child!”	400.0929685319297
50099m	360.60341236633974
“Yes,” answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had	424.726639598327
raised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old	365.53270535144634
man’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to	472.6872513532902
behold his child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his	360.4073507345089
companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of	377.17892094807814
the corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face,	401.74762940581206
which looked like that of a sleeping angel.	447.1072856126371
A tear, which appeared in the old man’s eye, expressed his thanks to	363.60175818380344
the doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner	477.593656112271
of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by	406.1176579333196
d’Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few	413.88229510055385
words thanked the district doctor, he turned to d’Avrigny, and said:	352.4292767376543
“And now the priest.”	438.28866832962746
“Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?” asked	372.6024384600957
d’Avrigny.	387.71069838867027
“No.” said Villefort; “fetch the nearest.”	342.32431386867285
“The nearest,” said the district doctor, “is a good Italian abbé, who	354.05238177797816
lives next door to you. Shall I call on him as I pass?”	464.6114540641769
“D’Avrigny,” said Villefort, “be so kind, I beseech you, as to	442.1971105744556
accompany this gentleman. Here is the key of the door, so that you can	493.3550931509419
go in and out as you please; you will bring the priest with you, and	480.0672381115623
will oblige me by introducing him into my child’s room.”	452.9629761978938
50101m	356.0278100320665
“Do you wish to see him?”	422.33276749613674
“I only wish to be alone. You will excuse me, will you not? A priest	376.04276416306664
can understand a father’s grief.”	460.2135339399297
And M. de Villefort, giving the key to d’Avrigny, again bade farewell	436.31718628041574
to the strange doctor, and retired to his study, where he began to	457.6227007740367
work. For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.	401.4167810105203
As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing	319.14438774038115
on the threshold of the next door.	404.0870264659105
“This is the abbé of whom I spoke,” said the doctor to d’Avrigny.	411.3466821313972
D’Avrigny accosted the priest.	378.4332588869327
“Sir,” he said, “are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an	464.88245660322934
unhappy father who has just lost his daughter? I mean M. de Villefort,	365.02408882012753
the king’s attorney.”	435.7495464000899
“Ah,” said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; “yes, I have heard	446.07049685245283
that death is in that house.”	313.22978115769087
“Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.”	389.2478242237621
“I was about to offer myself, sir,” said the priest; “it is our mission	421.82253273653714
to forestall our duties.”	495.17668645376466
“It is a young girl.”	383.9245076996925
“I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me. I	352.91668882962585
also know that her name is Valentine, and I have already prayed for	415.451824537229
her.”	446.7612197230129
“Thank you, sir,” said d’Avrigny; “since you have commenced your sacred	308.92454081807637
office, deign to continue it. Come and watch by the dead, and all the	322.8534659090053
wretched family will be grateful to you.”	495.20342428033206
“I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be	438.599547290984
more fervent than mine.”	376.525413745681
D’Avrigny took the priest’s hand, and without meeting Villefort, who	488.98984457426684
was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine’s room, which on the	426.66855741554616
following night was to be occupied by the undertakers. On entering the	463.97970205596584
room, Noirtier’s eyes met those of the abbé, and no doubt he read some	299.19920133660617
particular expression in them, for he remained in the room. D’Avrigny	470.4529259915641
recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the	402.84742871400033
dead, and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his	463.8802799197335
attentions to Noirtier.	487.72524016481475
In order, doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling	337.6702302738685
his sacred mission, the priest rose as soon as d’Avrigny departed, and	435.85875549799556
not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but	301.46719506971715
also that leading to Madame de Villefort’s room.	329.69159051255906
 Chapter 104. Danglars’ Signature	448.3329267541093
The next morning dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the	323.5172984692827
undertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the	441.32502490895
corpse in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the	348.68615173198754
equality of death, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing	454.36815620488505
in life. This winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of	318.3915800673741
cambric, which the young girl had bought a fortnight before.	433.42890260519164
During the evening two men, engaged for the purpose, had carried	485.5692822794289
Noirtier from Valentine’s room into his own, and contrary to all	394.1896267342106
expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child.	489.12029586515825
The Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight, and then left without	324.810594296963
calling anyone. D’Avrigny returned about eight o’clock in the morning;	481.1559163833987
he met Villefort on his way to Noirtier’s room, and accompanied him to	358.6394885190527
see how the old man had slept. They found him in the large armchair,	455.75167078814763
which served him for a bed, enjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling	444.9186088167189
sleep. They both stood in amazement at the door.	415.90628390012216
“See,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “nature knows how to alleviate the	469.7440526252333
deepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child,	424.9080716818088
and yet he sleeps.”	418.4713352362567
“Yes, you are right,” replied Villefort, surprised; “he sleeps, indeed!	420.2302648836171
And this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him	446.5131091839114
awake all night.”	453.97326011597005
“Grief has stunned him,” replied d’Avrigny; and they both returned	418.91378870199225
thoughtfully to the procureur’s study.	417.33263372369646
“See, I have not slept,” said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;	369.84190508883876
“grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for two nights; but	424.81654648679256
then look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and	478.57461624006055
nights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation	434.03087805416703
against the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,—my passion, my joy, my	325.4065514842151
delight,—it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!” and he convulsively	308.61699166932704
grasped the hand of d’Avrigny.	315.6106258627853
“Do you require my services now?” asked d’Avrigny.	390.05005017587166
“No,” said Villefort; “only return again at eleven o’clock; at twelve	313.44831402013466
the—the—oh, Heavens, my poor, poor child!” and the procureur again	317.0994065383971
becoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.	468.02959283094833
“Shall you be present in the reception-room?”	487.38898218169356
“No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall work,	351.99672638504836
doctor—when I work I forget everything.”	472.9306381124818
And, indeed, no sooner had the doctor left the room, than he was again	315.0632944034244
absorbed in work. On the doorsteps d’Avrigny met the cousin whom	488.5440867395441
Villefort had mentioned, a personage as insignificant in our story as	444.2691086554987
in the world he occupied—one of those beings designed from their birth	447.15202332400895
to make themselves useful to others. He was punctual, dressed in black,	380.4224301727281
with crape around his hat, and presented himself at his cousin’s with a	383.7589768867085
face made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be	496.75667472860687
required.	337.1876383373818
At eleven o’clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and	485.7831739345461
the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers,	492.9744803908762
equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich,	321.4909304467665
and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the	408.22060054698767
marriage of a duchess.	418.7345423750433
Gradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made	361.52769271747434
their appearance—we mean Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp,	414.916361026804
accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in	488.7021691963812
literature, or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first	457.5537061571956
Parisian circles, less owing to his social position than to his	338.294660606153
personal merit.	494.0953939138934
The cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was	419.36377172591165
rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as	443.3509283936812
themselves, and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears, as	316.2156974576909
would have been the case with a father, a brother, or a lover. Those	333.99154955688044
who were acquainted soon formed into little groups. One of them was	334.87380974501673
made of Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp.	347.85371422478886
“Poor girl,” said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute	375.4578189748121
to the sad event,—“poor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! Could	434.26441318173124
you have imagined this scene, Château-Renaud, when we saw her, at the	348.66267219584506
most three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?”	455.9192368548429
“Indeed, no,” said Château-Renaud.”	303.17593429625316
“Did you know her?”	346.2622161761183
“I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf’s, among the rest;	382.76487276545583
she appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is her	370.9025927789153
stepmother? Do you know?”	492.55078826121365
“She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is	471.1863487456835
receiving us.”	414.7583329095034
50105m	348.34348233523696
“Who is he?”	457.37055644320276
“Whom do you mean?”	493.1837195124426
“The gentleman who receives us? Is he a deputy?”	309.00745321709087
“Oh, no. I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,” said	447.70395584700645
Beauchamp; “but he is perfectly unknown to me.”	459.47400247377004
“Have you mentioned this death in your paper?”	453.55599988588494
“It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt if	325.95515024603156
it will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths	489.11035450120215
had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king’s attorney, he	461.5863168423764
would have interested himself somewhat more about it.”	447.35809046356565
“Still,” said Château-Renaud, “Dr. d’Avrigny, who attends my mother,	333.5835170766931
declares he is in despair about it. But whom are you seeking, Debray?”	428.0064501048779
“I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo” said the young man.	391.7215277227941
“I met him on the boulevard, on my way here,” said Beauchamp. “I think	450.30436266533286
he is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.”	468.5250632670443
“His banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?” asked Château-Renaud	419.6468556104221
of Debray.	387.15894558479175
“I believe so,” replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. “But	471.6393263676691
Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.”	459.6073553464204
“Morrel? Do they know him?” asked Château-Renaud. “I think he has only	390.055645859465
been introduced to Madame de Villefort.”	310.94954387321775
“Still, he ought to have been here,” said Debray; “I wonder what will	330.3491638349188
be talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush,	442.97933970371855
here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some	307.2910238112396
little speech to the cousin,” and the three young men drew near to	404.9011307434017
listen.	421.2331721632254
Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he	406.4479953058772
had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la	340.0158716553245
Chaussée d’Antin, to M. Danglars’. The banker saw the carriage of the	447.9155630640541
count enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though	490.70184651623515
affable smile.	457.0659428132583
“Well,” said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, “I suppose you	491.54418215980763
have come to sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken	336.96540804104734
possession of my house. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself	435.71972367236015
whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would	498.95290485818305
have justified the proverb of ‘He who wishes misfortunes to happen to	441.1733760734579
others experiences them himself.’ Well, on my word of honor, I	436.04089968536755
answered, ‘No!’ I wished no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud,	479.94112091900143
perhaps, for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all	348.0539117206628
have our faults. Do you know, count, that persons of our time of	389.9777236870008
life—not that you belong to the class, you are still a young man,—but	449.0392646227149
as I was saying, persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate	384.2638305260899
this year. For example, look at the puritanical procureur, who has just	431.6028344388193
lost his daughter, and in fact nearly all his family, in so singular a	476.53983061755594
manner; Morcerf dishonored and dead; and then myself covered with	460.37294312213646
ridicule through the villany of Benedetto; besides——”	476.5490350461042
“Besides what?” asked the Count.	308.8231245651793
“Alas, do you not know?”	476.78983990715346
“What new calamity?”	350.1356200960488
“My daughter——”	341.2870134343672
“Mademoiselle Danglars?”	342.0461623180666
“Eugénie has left us!”	484.2140501055478
“Good heavens, what are you telling me?”	392.5217333961339
“The truth, my dear count. Oh, how happy you must be in not having	392.0991921416613
either wife or children!”	406.2846603275342
“Do you think so?”	326.7147320641486
“Indeed I do.”	416.4359834858111
“And so Mademoiselle Danglars——”	335.06441041024925
“She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she	366.64450089183094
asked permission to travel.”	487.0914546132878
“And is she gone?”	469.0678218935454
“The other night she left.”	359.1678950376082
“With Madame Danglars?”	464.78623482744933
“No, with a relation. But still, we have quite lost our dear Eugénie;	345.02233013932204
for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France.”	411.5171543756253
“Still, baron,” said Monte Cristo, “family griefs, or indeed any other	364.9367680352332
affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure,	342.0481224525435
are endurable to a millionaire. Philosophers may well say, and	436.18688917060643
practical men will always support the opinion, that money mitigates	314.56479781934127
many trials; and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm, you	371.2784406571584
ought to be very easily consoled—you, the king of finance, the focus of	402.16058184095306
immeasurable power.”	454.7247544068623
Danglars looked at him askance, as though to ascertain whether he spoke	449.9443755996133
seriously.	437.4147728461959
“Yes,” he answered, “if a fortune brings consolation, I ought to be	353.8430287906862
consoled; I am rich.”	401.5176488413804
“So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you	454.1079237364014
wished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you	305.292887887051
would not dare!”	367.5897101820716
Danglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the count. “That	387.5232636341076
reminds me,” he said, “that when you entered I was on the point of	445.15290289904544
signing five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you allow me	488.8832218729451
to do the same to the others?”	363.74672824819226
“Pray do so.”	413.51638417369185
There was a moment’s silence, during which the noise of the banker’s	419.67707185656093
pen was alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on	497.03997811207194
the ceiling.	476.4024502752451
“Are they Spanish, Haitian, or Neapolitan bonds?” said Monte Cristo.	421.36782796517645
“No,” said Danglars, smiling, “they are bonds on the bank of France,	317.97901908041285
payable to bearer. Stay, count,” he added, “you, who may be called the	338.7377260496981
emperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you many pieces	424.95642003041115
of paper of this size, each worth a million?”	490.81884853931194
The count took into his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly	429.08429800148207
presented to him, and read:—	476.7961359416917
“‘To the Governor of the Bank. Please pay to my order, from the fund	305.00530237165634
deposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my	391.65915343829266
account.	399.5309948624888
“Baron Danglars.’”	360.87211493220593
“One, two, three, four, five,” said Monte Cristo; “five millions—why	358.4741718318909
what a Crœsus you are!”	417.3212824510618
“This is how I transact business,” said Danglars.	489.80230643885295
“It is really wonderful,” said the count; “above all, if, as I suppose,	400.6003252554583
it is payable at sight.”	409.12226279107915
“It is, indeed,” said Danglars.	378.79183810326776
“It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in France	303.9265412093082
these things are done. Five millions on five little scraps of paper!—it	363.0602664413043
must be seen to be believed.”	383.0222549171292
“You do not doubt it?”	385.2186930018886
“No!”	489.89093054255466
“You say so with an accent—stay, you shall be convinced; take my clerk	343.28521445569095
to the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the	418.3366874543054
Treasury for the same sum.”	349.94878182902477
“No,” said Monte Cristo folding the five notes, “most decidedly not;	375.3555882501793
the thing is so curious, I will make the experiment myself. I am	384.54643682235195
credited on you for six millions. I have drawn nine hundred thousand	362.8726395743691
francs, you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand	437.44479007871166
francs. I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds,	449.3239586169283
with your signature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the six	451.95955736975077
millions between us. I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in	349.2137735501153
want of money today.”	379.87366317033116
And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand, while	307.20479979365336
with the other he held out the receipt to Danglars. If a thunderbolt	421.2527831762461
had fallen at the banker’s feet, he could not have experienced greater	373.5814846878491
terror.	474.7809728789674
“What,” he stammered, “do you mean to keep that money? Excuse me,	361.061300369808
excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,—a deposit which I	489.80508996985566
promised to pay this morning.”	431.3134329280149
“Oh, well, then,” said Monte Cristo, “I am not particular about these	381.27198325455186
five notes, pay me in a different form; I wished, from curiosity, to	328.01249115265483
take these, that I might be able to say that without any advice or	326.297294706743
preparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a	440.84023921610276
minute’s delay; it would have been remarkable. But here are your bonds;	373.8327787755252
pay me differently;” and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized	448.2099893579702
them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is	471.7707197987328
being wrested from its grasp.	328.1530905438886
Suddenly he rallied, made a violent effort to restrain himself, and	309.41636460793245
then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed	357.1399434299725
countenance.	417.40690234601226
50109m	430.93028308539317
“Certainly,” he said, “your receipt is money.”	363.801808148329
“Oh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson & French	376.10004073683166
would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than	481.00541739252037
you have just done.”	435.8091989222919
“Pardon me, count, pardon me.”	387.2419955932993
“Then I may keep this money?”	412.2047768632662
“Yes,” said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of	435.28096303087386
his hair. “Yes, keep it—keep it.”	446.84221889123944
Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable	378.5880581772798
expression which seemed to say, “Come, reflect; if you repent there is	459.62945454791907
still time.”	373.7747588137609
“No,” said Danglars, “no, decidedly no; keep my signatures. But you	309.22155655534067
know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended	494.710458758826
this money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I	392.5886673499368
did not pay them with these precise bonds. How absurd—as if one crown	488.59343552231843
were not as good as another. Excuse me;” and he began to laugh loudly,	326.3202447906215
but nervously.	415.1549626545744
“Certainly, I excuse you,” said Monte Cristo graciously, “and pocket	378.914794977561
them.” And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.	370.30570545138727
“But,” said Danglars, “there is still a sum of one hundred thousand	424.1529349696126
francs?”	374.39535959487625
“Oh, a mere nothing,” said Monte Cristo. “The balance would come to	329.5211858316224
about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits.”	372.5867780048437
“Count,” said Danglars, “are you speaking seriously?”	490.73992900336475
“I never joke with bankers,” said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner,	344.43170060873445
which repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as the	325.75364012318147
valet de chambre announced:	369.43060443951686
“M. de Boville, Receiver-General of the charities.”	433.41959237580727
“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo; “I think I arrived just in time to	466.8139245945724
obtain your signatures, or they would have been disputed with me.”	388.27340603685366
Danglars again became pale, and hastened to conduct the count out.	367.8654067277513
Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville, who was	352.6554966893799
standing in the waiting-room, and who was introduced into Danglars’	391.9164558497309
room as soon as the count had left.	497.0194232632081
The count’s serious face was illumined by a faint smile, as he noticed	483.4617980739815
the portfolio which the receiver-general held in his hand. At the door	303.1040712824906
he found his carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank.	301.90952967046957
Meanwhile Danglars, repressing all emotion, advanced to meet the	348.13048485404795
receiver-general. We need not say that a smile of condescension was	477.77220118377284
stamped upon his lips.	438.6593417000935
“Good-morning, creditor,” said he; “for I wager anything it is the	458.7193223397268
creditor who visits me.”	357.93221044417754
“You are right, baron,” answered M. de Boville; “the charities present	487.918166336951
themselves to you through me; the widows and orphans depute me to	478.70084630862914
receive alms to the amount of five millions from you.”	492.8651962183385
“And yet they say orphans are to be pitied,” said Danglars, wishing to	311.2563350527531
prolong the jest. “Poor things!”	428.4181837894539
“Here I am in their name,” said M. de Boville; “but did you receive my	428.49363765646444
letter yesterday?”	326.9248980998151
“Yes.”	442.41400961101755
“I have brought my receipt.”	398.81979292110776
50111m	462.91008443912295
“My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by	398.70361098165165
waiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw	468.66004124534425
leaving here—you did see him, I think?”	487.8959260048613
“Yes; well?”	498.90418780499726
“Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions.”	330.56755154013456
“How so?”	423.667053510035
“The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by Thomson	365.9034102668095
& French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once, which I	390.8286109096165
paid him with checks on the bank. My funds are deposited there, and you	414.223818086587
can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will	341.9149108427551
appear rather strange to the governor. Two days will be a different	497.169818350394
thing,” said Danglars, smiling.	425.1567608111245
“Come,” said Boville, with a tone of entire incredulity, “five millions	417.1861719409771
to that gentleman who just left, and who bowed to me as though he knew	310.8994679383888
me?”	433.48767952385174
“Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte Cristo	362.30909375310625
knows everybody.”	335.5473234639512
“Five millions!”	489.0863650124868
“Here is his receipt. Believe your own eyes.” M. de Boville took the	345.6862712554526
paper Danglars presented him, and read:	367.1138231989665
“Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred	486.57617149829446
thousand francs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson &	466.86334155493375
French of Rome.”	347.63021691884535
“It is really true,” said M. de Boville.	299.15840305064734
“Do you know the house of Thomson & French?”	436.95716076400544
“Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000	490.28946401926305
francs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned.”	476.11643437155556
“It is one of the best houses in Europe,” said Danglars, carelessly	485.8764022299841
throwing down the receipt on his desk.	463.55747212441713
“And he had five millions in your hands alone! Why, this Count of Monte	395.896927000899
Cristo must be a nabob?”	394.8128567860048
“Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits—one on	481.69837577541466
me, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see,” he added	342.7966565487039
carelessly, “he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance of	343.5794696788335
100,000 francs.”	438.1678300630682
M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration.	490.76409409089274
“I must visit him,” he said, “and obtain some pious grant from him.”	305.8152541783896
“Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000	344.5347818409306
francs a month.”	438.6643605393008
“It is magnificent! I will set before him the example of Madame de	415.90507914176874
Morcerf and her son.”	334.49782030730967
“What example?”	437.4418636862149
“They gave all their fortune to the hospitals.”	425.2838745313907
“What fortune?”	307.31257932068814
“Their own—M. de Morcerf’s, who is deceased.”	348.9283142735626
“For what reason?”	437.4959099332198
“Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired.”	354.65032806772575
“And what are they to live upon?”	466.5965072491375
“The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.”	302.52523133184
50113m	324.47170915733466
“Well, I must confess, these are scruples.”	452.21072713497034
“I registered their deed of gift yesterday.”	430.91082012484077
“And how much did they possess?”	373.8556440354962
“Oh, not much—from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs. But to	390.667529377266
return to our millions.”	445.2247646416374
“Certainly,” said Danglars, in the most natural tone in the world. “Are	476.4138447546399
you then pressed for this money?”	338.03701305293663
“Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow.”	355.82179750847496
“Tomorrow? Why did you not tell me so before? Why, it is as good as a	333.14985141792283
century! At what hour does the examination take place?”	326.1400682713848
“At two o’clock.”	320.7545813868128
“Send at twelve,” said Danglars, smiling.	455.0244710641772
M. de Boville said nothing, but nodded his head, and took up the	325.7394243223125
portfolio.	400.7243831141301
“Now I think of it, you can do better,” said Danglars.	408.05328944498706
“How do you mean?”	488.7064940859041
“The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to	358.3747578624964
Rothschild’s or Lafitte’s, and they will take it off your hands at	381.60492968983164
once.”	373.7604675564383
“What, though payable at Rome?”	374.5839922132615
“Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.”	334.5391222765821
The receiver started back.	329.85274552551914
“_Ma foi!_” he said, “I prefer waiting till tomorrow. What a	402.8427403072826
proposition!”	337.9916858467168
“I thought, perhaps,” said Danglars with supreme impertinence, “that	325.3836959805017
you had a deficiency to make up?”	308.05469307017825
“Indeed,” said the receiver.	442.9628788581999
“And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some	446.90876774597086
sacrifice.”	432.63863867721994
“Thank you, no, sir.”	314.05226110678046
“Then it will be tomorrow.”	324.3820689930734
“Yes; but without fail.”	426.51027957305934
“Ah, you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank	469.4610975112903
shall be notified.”	476.80889100048523
“I will come myself.”	397.9284593085694
“Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.”	468.9170636242975
They shook hands.	498.3277213706741
“By the way,” said M. de Boville, “are you not going to the funeral of	449.1425685553127
poor Mademoiselle de Villefort, which I met on my road here?”	396.72325203234413
“No,” said the banker; “I have appeared rather ridiculous since that	472.90002096882205
affair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background.”	332.5082713451819
“Bah, you are wrong. How were you to blame in that affair?”	371.2474598415422
“Listen—when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is rather	456.5391966855886
sensitive.”	389.06694423910426
“Everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, Mademoiselle Danglars!”	406.7447598853634
“Poor Eugénie!” said Danglars; “do you know she is going to embrace a	468.756300600979
religious life?”	445.6830264300097
“No.”	436.46087691113286
“Alas, it is unhappily but too true. The day after the event, she	441.55604577971417
decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone	370.2795826636134
to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.”	433.8739883937036
“Oh, it is terrible!” and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation,	378.222819437431
after expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had scarcely	321.1623952138186
left before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone	437.40860892370296
understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24	427.5671528877414
exclaimed:	426.03146916998514
“Fool!”	309.97334882373167
Then enclosing Monte Cristo’s receipt in a little pocket-book, he	334.29979814142246
added:—“Yes, come at twelve o’clock; I shall then be far away.”	334.2557632078842
Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected	428.8319605653693
about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several papers, left	333.6003140239372
others exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter which he	462.0412703677859
addressed:	321.7060793337256
“To Madame la Baronne Danglars.”	361.78744074427794
“I will place it on her table myself tonight,” he murmured. Then taking	369.741491528651
a passport from his drawer he said,—“Good, it is available for two	370.7411166681741
months longer.”	350.3589033948515
 Chapter 105. The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise	409.7770382972805
M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking	341.31175433977654
Valentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a	322.163817905506
cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the	444.7950249261408
trees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards.	479.53198569666085
M. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of	366.90586814605297
Père-Lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a	496.0699517467384
Parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be	352.3367020355419
surrounded by worthy associates. He had therefore purchased a vault,	385.83569765091306
which was quickly occupied by members of his family. On the front of	323.1247091157273
the monument was inscribed: “The families of Saint-Méran and	340.3096849656151
Villefort,” for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée,	493.8728423719275
Valentine’s mother. The pompous procession therefore wended its way	445.76541133931823
towards Père-Lachaise from the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Having crossed	487.91557982754665
Paris, it passed through the Faubourg du Temple, then leaving the	448.85211313439095
exterior boulevards, it reached the cemetery. More than fifty private	344.25420358335793
carriages followed the twenty mourning-coaches, and behind them more	470.9356737224886
than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot.	446.69823826420316
50117m	372.77609348996754
These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine’s death had	358.31814573820935
struck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness	397.58588730508717
of the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the	358.16589954650715
memory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the	444.96777275842754
flower of her youth.	441.3473470337299
As they left Paris, an equipage with four horses, at full speed, was	379.8868179994986
seen to draw up suddenly; it contained Monte Cristo. The count left the	485.56945674967096
carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot. Château-Renaud	310.22217225438163
perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_, joined him;	473.45732948765146
Beauchamp did the same.	328.13706465362856
The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was	415.8286158019137
evidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment.	429.29481261230285
50119m	442.90049353397444
“Where is Morrel?” he asked; “do either of these gentlemen know where	448.6231215243794
he is?”	411.6743795148813
“We have already asked that question,” said Château-Renaud, “for none	424.0205082006685
of us has seen him.”	354.4660292304927
The count was silent, but continued to gaze around him. At length they	348.96779721200465
arrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced	343.55208890592263
through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon relieved from all	299.79113282918036
anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo	316.94717575199
recognized him whom he sought.	397.4882697868212
One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent	385.53279115606017
metropolis. Black figures are seen scattered over the long white	379.05482648300574
avenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise	424.9818455903057
made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments;	316.6141319443744
then follows the melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then	315.6749132782426
with a sob of anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass	416.6421475729927
of flowers.	385.4965599636195
The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of	492.9625171253694
Abélard and Héloïse, placed itself close to the heads of the horses	442.8131625757212
belonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker’s men, arrived	314.63498154221617
with them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person’s attention	393.51826369492716
was occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one	474.6192305882937
else observed. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object	332.65646077945826
of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the	358.40939144341075
procession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with his	402.92399896507186
coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively	484.5625567960104
crushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated	422.73776160525017
on an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral	352.07795704577103
details could escape his observation.	420.49153207949837
Everything was conducted in the usual manner. A few men, the least	389.3563131582812
impressed of all by the scene, pronounced a discourse, some deploring	464.4608554716226
this premature death, others expatiating on the grief of the father,	312.93621356157695
and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that Valentine had	342.58597256905523
solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice	484.1365154311942
was ready to fall—until at length they exhausted their stores of	468.47714813195694
metaphor and mournful speeches, elaborate variations on the stanzas of	346.2425221084494
Malherbe to Du Périer.	383.2132527120069
Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose	325.9799814120987
calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in	479.99423135053246
his heart.	427.52811303543047
“See,” said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. “What is he doing	388.3189171585932
up there?” And they called Château-Renaud’s attention to him.	390.377061030808
“How pale he is!” said Château-Renaud, shuddering.	425.46224346833446
“He is cold,” said Debray.	441.52519694936007
“Not at all,” said Château-Renaud, slowly; “I think he is violently	400.03601154950417
agitated. He is very susceptible.”	393.8940080047848
“Bah,” said Debray; “he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort; you	408.95780376585395
said so yourself.”	377.56426777592037
“True. Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de	460.11100107458583
Morcerf’s. Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced such	308.0343047753211
an effect?”	494.58341504778343
50121m	317.1902967226116
“No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of what or	463.6754505609333
to whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching Morrel,	438.0088272414032
who was holding his breath with emotion.	453.79041991123097
“The discourse is over; farewell, gentlemen,” said the count,	359.22774187484936
unceremoniously.	393.80582004636415
And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went.	456.80901221100294
The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris. Château-Renaud	458.82148444105565
looked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were watching the	340.1134535532634
departure of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and	460.1353180767611
Château-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp.	311.2944529201435
Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the	315.82400380319166
arrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by	485.0726025792575
spectators and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it	360.49410895389025
reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet	491.4063993174426
nearer, still unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with	354.976122407799
outstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to	367.0298499157169
pounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till	426.26617045739243
it touched the stone, then clutching the grating with both hands, he	308.14263867005525
murmured:	450.8507858552665
“Oh, Valentine!”	476.77883491102773
The count’s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he	392.76164307803265
stepped forward, and touching the young man’s shoulder, said:	329.63176567587203
“I was looking for you, my friend.” Monte Cristo expected a burst of	305.8380841419288
passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning round, said calmly,—	316.04857579319355
“You see I was praying.” The scrutinizing glance of the count searched	332.6337143481154
the young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy.	358.36183568285537
“Shall I drive you back to Paris?” he asked.	451.6346793925692
“No, thank you.”	411.6997861911644
“Do you wish anything?”	371.83855723697536
“Leave me to pray.”	309.99220685674806
The count withdrew without opposition, but it was only to place himself	430.03133434368823
in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel, who at	434.36099189765673
length arose, brushed the dust from his knees, and turned towards	349.3570745775344
Paris, without once looking back. He walked slowly down the Rue de la	346.20266459194465
Roquette. The count, dismissing his carriage, followed him about a	333.88192175159884
hundred paces behind. Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue	420.30884393808606
Meslay by the boulevards.	450.86120870751597
Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrel’s entrance, it	356.359032359702
was again opened for the count. Julie was at the entrance of the	411.0904336707232
garden, where she was attentively watching Penelon, who, entering with	398.03785690414554
zeal into his profession of gardener, was very busy grafting some	424.28505650694075
Bengal roses. “Ah, count,” she exclaimed, with the delight manifested	413.5488846366694
by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Meslay.	343.42133218244743
“Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?” asked the count.	466.37374605266
50123m	355.36542343465266
“Yes, I think I saw him pass; but pray, call Emmanuel.”	299.56790888124067
“Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian’s room this	316.2453576359764
instant,” replied Monte Cristo, “I have something of the greatest	322.7445578740461
importance to tell him.”	408.8154853465951
“Go, then,” she said with a charming smile, which accompanied him until	465.3934021069133
he had disappeared.	423.50952159423207
Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor	476.7178340193983
to Maximilian’s room; when he reached the landing he listened	497.2851846537902
attentively, but all was still. Like many old houses occupied by a	386.61415713818303
single family, the room door was panelled with glass; but it was	387.5198725275569
locked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was impossible to see what was	313.6340308842702
passing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn before the glass.	306.58700710718284
The count’s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom	432.75357356231393
appeared on the face of that imperturbable man.	490.93192498210357
“What shall I do!” he uttered, and reflected for a moment; “shall I	430.87544250520443
ring? No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will but	459.13740256393714
accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilian’s situation, and then	416.1003148628239
the bell would be followed by a louder noise.”	314.8989484906084
Monte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had	434.7329624589775
been taken with the rapidity of lightning, he struck one of the panes	316.5444450766702
of glass with his elbow; the glass was shivered to atoms, then	493.32203692987326
withdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel, who had been writing at his	401.7957996746979
desk, bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window.	357.5949012176516
“I beg a thousand pardons,” said the count, “there is nothing the	341.4180762120723
matter, but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my	424.56935645124713
elbow. Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to enter your	299.38208511570065
room; do not disturb yourself—do not disturb yourself!”	370.88652896533046
And passing his hand through the broken glass, the count opened the	481.53208925428424
door. Morrel, evidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less	383.7839655734906
with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry.	469.90170448266554
“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo, rubbing his elbow, “it’s all your	310.69429389407173
servant’s fault; your stairs are so polished, it is like walking on	467.2644113487946
glass.”	387.70317587251196
“Are you hurt, sir?” coldly asked Morrel.	401.3055906951894
“I believe not. But what are you about there? You were writing.”	378.14520139301607
“I?”	332.4241507414913
“Your fingers are stained with ink.”	458.197256648115
“Ah, true, I was writing. I do sometimes, soldier though I am.”	486.98864722135306
Monte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him	475.06391245295646
pass, but he followed him.	428.0565922604231
“You were writing?” said Monte Cristo with a searching look.	304.26571254931144
“I have already had the honor of telling you I was,” said Morrel.	477.7259947264106
The count looked around him.	309.4578353532277
“Your pistols are beside your desk,” said Monte Cristo, pointing with	399.23934696295856
his finger to the pistols on the table.	333.45221592198794
“I am on the point of starting on a journey,” replied Morrel	438.0513871493572
disdainfully.	317.4674396947565
“My friend,” exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness.	390.96519181225045
“Sir?”	314.73307687078176
“My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I	310.58646489337787
entreat you.”	497.27483888517816
“I make a hasty resolution?” said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; “is	455.00631498985433
there anything extraordinary in a journey?”	307.28029734784934
50125m	480.2639852565777
“Maximilian,” said the count, “let us both lay aside the mask we have	482.62662839857336
assumed. You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose	333.35828265607313
upon you with my frivolous solicitude. You can understand, can you not,	448.4335321510206
that to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to have	415.6064830913165
intruded on the solitude of a friend—you can understand that, to have	431.9840295854249
done all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or rather	443.5980451983712
by a terrible conviction. Morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!”	425.71000380148297
“Indeed, count,” said Morrel, shuddering; “what has put this into your	496.0277317752574
head?”	359.9112626021461
“I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,” continued the	481.9280611698769
count, “and here is proof of what I say;” and, approaching the desk, he	485.7594609139054
removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he	350.2198842755506
had begun, and took the latter in his hands.	400.23491066807685
Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving	356.20417768572844
his intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp.	388.48412012542724
“You wish to destroy yourself,” said the count; “you have written it.”	337.1584286233729
“Well,” said Morrel, changing his expression of calmness for one of	388.44533688207457
violence—“well, and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself,	497.50731475197347
who shall prevent me—who will dare prevent me? All my hopes are	478.93437239492926
blighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything around me is	449.915728526562
sad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and human voices	370.6311958526169
distract me. It is a mercy to let me die, for if I live I shall lose my	350.89254682234497
reason and become mad. When, sir, I tell you all this with tears of	429.986141266495
heartfelt anguish, can you reply that I am wrong, can you prevent my	333.3210406083899
putting an end to my miserable existence? Tell me, sir, could you have	324.8333782119759
the courage to do so?”	393.22068434761917
“Yes, Morrel,” said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted	354.2705655550299
strangely with the young man’s excitement; “yes, I would do so.”	449.89760999807686
“You?” exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach—“you, who	458.73724661886524
have deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with	469.794951435481
vain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have seen	444.96556840952536
her die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand everything, even the	413.60643311770013
hidden sources of knowledge,—and who enact the part of a guardian angel	496.65228942472504
upon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison	337.1690436023074
administered to a young girl! Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with	341.0048157635837
pity, were you not hateful in my eyes.”	410.82089265171163
“Morrel——”	392.1801447540639
“Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be	373.419251132382
satisfied! When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you—my	361.2536617099447
heart was softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But	352.8735469659094
since you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture	481.44146307074897
after I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo	451.33953249735254
my pretended benefactor—then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal	467.51872024152897
guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;”	478.84518556260673
and Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.	417.58298284663226
“And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.”	322.9912343188524
“Prevent me, then!” replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like	451.62651897687294
the first, failed in releasing him from the count’s iron grasp.	354.868844095707
“I will prevent you.”	308.82375105244466
50127m	384.939987968595
“And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right	439.6278824972338
over free and rational beings?”	453.7336512742796
“Who am I?” repeated Monte Cristo. “Listen; I am the only man in the	409.62016807853746
world having the right to say to you, ‘Morrel, your father’s son shall	438.9845249958307
not die today;’” and Monte Cristo, with an expression of majesty and	393.69665161583424
sublimity, advanced with arms folded toward the young man, who,	327.5763250411543
involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man, recoiled a	375.1659247962174
step.	409.09002428408735
“Why do you mention my father?” stammered he; “why do you mingle a	472.4454250978909
recollection of him with the affairs of today?”	379.1341728502225
“Because I am he who saved your father’s life when he wished to destroy	334.7221223383381
himself, as you do today—because I am the man who sent the purse to	353.969030535621
your young sister, and the _Pharaon_ to old Morrel—because I am the	491.3416868961914
Edmond Dantès who nursed you, a child, on my knees.”	398.9472549754242
Morrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then	399.7884480206352
all his strength give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte	401.7220980470092
Cristo. Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden	467.41637029736955
revulsion; he arose, rushed out of the room and to the stairs,	364.81099772766436
exclaiming energetically, “Julie, Julie—Emmanuel, Emmanuel!”	431.0810071814849
Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died	332.73261300026655
rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed	324.94104605531624
upon the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in	375.77177303215933
alarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands,	457.00194539711026
and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs:	464.2510632812879
“On your knees—on your knees—he is our benefactor—the saviour of our	337.0052492034272
father! He is——”	467.1342121570302
He would have added “Edmond Dantès,” but the count seized his arm and	373.2902351699814
prevented him.	354.3683111062908
Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel embraced him	411.00326023091515
as a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and struck the	321.1282648604505
ground with his forehead. Then the iron-hearted man felt his heart	355.8459759969823
swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his	320.54220834566297
eyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the	410.93078316284345
room but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful	336.974615333755
hearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep	330.7311938915295
emotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor,	398.715657929304
ran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal	440.917558914711
globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Allées de	494.73211613516145
Meilhan. Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count:	409.42581387736084
“Oh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown	388.74077404303085
benefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his	391.25932112074264
memory,—how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to	300.14286394828105
us? Oh, it was cruel to us, and—dare I say it?—to you also.”	452.16769776984745
“Listen, my friends,” said the count—“I may call you so since we have	407.0801920334914
really been friends for the last eleven years—the discovery of this	309.83118210296027
secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.	485.6144413656224
I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom, but your	395.2725189417365
brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now,	389.2272627585604
I am sure.”	335.3325991039054
Then turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees, had	329.78633572951173
thrown himself into an armchair, he added in a low voice, pressing	441.63741859939944
Emmanuel’s hand significantly, “Watch over him.”	393.4944102198674
“Why so?” asked the young man, surprised.	323.49991813552833
“I cannot explain myself; but watch over him.” Emmanuel looked around	376.8353187368124
the room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the	452.9407763448034
weapons, and he pointed to them. Monte Cristo bent his head. Emmanuel	446.79953615508987
went towards the pistols.	415.5337659119926
“Leave them,” said Monte Cristo. Then walking towards Morrel, he took	372.0508159251389
his hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a	403.6960393581653
profound stupor. Julie returned, holding the silken purse in her hands,	408.6398561844748
while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks, like dewdrops on the rose.	483.6735136581506
“Here is the relic,” she said; “do not think it will be less dear to us	367.0591322655774
now we are acquainted with our benefactor!”	333.9772020090503
“My child,” said Monte Cristo, coloring, “allow me to take back that	425.0525268699948
purse? Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered alone	401.2408877636468
through the affection I hope you will grant me.	440.1321868805046
“Oh,” said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, “no, no, I beseech	314.1485916077838
you do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us, will you	420.9894493630662
not?”	349.1199232866887
“You have guessed rightly, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, smiling; “in	303.1850033160681
a week I shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit	337.12439141716516
the vengeance of Heaven lived happily, while my father perished of	422.2895075576975
hunger and grief.”	344.0250562809394
While announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on Morrel, and	442.4199135422115
remarked that the words, “I shall have left this country,” had failed	449.7845117752653
to rouse him from his lethargy. He then saw that he must make another	421.4424168810473
struggle against the grief of his friend, and taking the hands of	377.96984930087416
Emmanuel and Julie, which he pressed within his own, he said with the	357.724467106085
mild authority of a father:	418.40171582113885
“My kind friends, leave me alone with Maximilian.”	348.33826208152317
Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic, which	416.0386433928428
Monte Cristo had forgotten. She drew her husband to the door. “Let us	399.24332095917543
leave them,” she said.	361.7527659528954
The count was alone with Morrel, who remained motionless as a statue.	369.4798005147031
“Come,” said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his finger, “are	467.01758402699807
you a man again, Maximilian?”	473.7875468701154
“Yes; for I begin to suffer again.”	439.7555084206824
The count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.	315.1480978634854
“Maximilian, Maximilian,” he said, “the ideas you yield to are unworthy	406.6133429233907
of a Christian.”	484.139389050236
“Oh, do not fear, my friend,” said Morrel, raising his head, and	466.0604499759481
smiling with a sweet expression on the count; “I shall no longer	384.5036813066086
attempt my life.”	418.18263183826286
“Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair?”	396.8218338752532
“No; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or	427.9677429599399
a knife.”	352.59919718117635
“Poor fellow, what is it?”	377.47705612802105
“My grief will kill me of itself.”	382.57012388431417
“My friend,” said Monte Cristo, with an expression of melancholy equal	314.62266070697865
to his own, “listen to me. One day, in a moment of despair like yours,	386.39938892085974
since it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one	336.66842013854443
day your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too. If	448.0241543919443
anyone had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to	326.1716488752697
his head—if anyone had told me, when in my prison I pushed back the	442.2859208485012
food I had not tasted for three days—if anyone had said to either of us	456.22602186555423
then, ‘Live—the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless	367.5288386327117
life!’—no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with	424.8817777806045
the smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,—and yet how many	448.08973193685006
times has your father blessed life while embracing you—how often have I	392.85982828686934
myself——”	419.81120810962807
“Ah,” exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, “you had only lost your	344.66286997643533
liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost	374.52997137550744
Valentine.”	493.11406721234596
“Look at me,” said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes	311.4178151289626
made him so eloquent and persuasive—“look at me. There are no tears in	307.1433575976112
my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer—you,	313.2578847077364
Maximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does not this tell you	449.27197194753387
that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to	426.8408566091657
beyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in the	441.9036564148689
conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your	497.6237130609915
life.”	386.0401681299121
“Oh, heavens,” said the young man, “oh, heavens—what are you saying,	484.7282241206417
count? Take care. But perhaps you have never loved!”	309.8144498476603
“Child!” replied the count.	467.85149672304755
“I mean, as I love. You see, I have been a soldier ever since I	486.1781432532403
attained manhood. I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for	402.34691339573067
none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of	340.9890886218561
love. Well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved	454.36702344989135
her, for two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all	487.5347328019012
the virtues of a daughter and wife. Count, to possess Valentine would	322.2819747109931
have been a happiness too infinite, too ecstatic, too complete, too	480.92472583814003
divine for this world, since it has been denied me; but without	328.9903653460171
Valentine the earth is desolate.”	416.3679570816365
“I have told you to hope,” said the count.	400.6951662779863
“Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you	446.3015301852482
succeed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again	498.46230422728127
behold Valentine.”	498.544968923087
The count smiled.	496.4897162996432
“My friend, my father,” said Morrel with excitement, “have a care, I	356.34512871049327
again repeat, for the power you wield over me alarms me. Weigh your	396.1330139328221
words before you speak, for my eyes have already become brighter, and	384.3513926915366
my heart beats strongly; be cautious, or you will make me believe in	346.5547598054701
supernatural agencies. I must obey you, though you bade me call forth	485.39351061872935
the dead or walk upon the water.”	444.0937141832577
“Hope, my friend,” repeated the count.	471.89815873842474
“Ah,” said Morrel, falling from the height of excitement to the abyss	414.49217586631744
of despair—“ah, you are playing with me, like those good, or rather	315.5836365680996
selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words, because	299.87830258946553
their screams annoy them. No, my friend, I was wrong to caution you; do	473.02529924546934
not fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will disguise it	465.12225289191736
so, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me. Adieu, my	338.8847456724119
friend, adieu!”	474.6597637587737
“On the contrary,” said the count, “after this time you must live with	401.51798781445336
me—you must not leave me, and in a week we shall have left France	446.1480865598466
behind us.”	340.999623788756
“And you still bid me hope?”	345.53782774442664
“I tell you to hope, because I have a method of curing you.”	331.18957949217935
“Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible. You think	364.53491124494167
the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and you	341.82323782399453
would cure it by an ordinary remedy—change of scene.” And Morrel	349.07262155169474
dropped his head with disdainful incredulity.	360.61178151690063
“What can I say more?” asked Monte Cristo. “I have confidence in the	339.19468329505503
remedy I propose, and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its	480.79788116447804
efficacy.”	321.064780918303
“Count, you prolong my agony.”	382.22816806530875
“Then,” said the count, “your feeble spirit will not even grant me the	322.2865250558857
trial I request? Come—do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is	346.6225047576691
capable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his	497.6014448820117
control? nay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well, wait for the	490.2282252438215
miracle I hope to accomplish, or——”	377.67105098538184
“Or?” repeated Morrel.	351.0397878844661
“Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.”	371.43554723159934
“Have pity on me, count!”	490.6825353693929
“I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that—listen to me	381.68978311154996
attentively—if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very	489.7393959779587
hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you,	367.24507877356746
and a cup of the deadliest Italian poison—a poison more sure and prompt	446.22390737424155
than that which has killed Valentine.”	394.25558015569163
“Will you promise me?”	418.5436367114001
“Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also	461.8680629391971
contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have	458.7412926139407
longed for the delights of an eternal sleep.”	321.4243329218199
“But you are sure you will promise me this?” said Morrel, intoxicated.	314.57533998752
“I not only promise, but swear it!” said Monte Cristo extending his	465.5222321931517
hand.	470.05514329780925
“In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let me	325.67873438239343
take my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not	496.82446392040094
call me ungrateful?”	445.10993441229607
“In a month, to the day, the very hour and the date is a sacred one,	451.07543937334697
Maximilian. I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of	377.65768451859407
September; it is ten years today since I saved your father’s life, who	397.53940772897727
wished to die.”	455.84464934367054
Morrel seized the count’s hand and kissed it; the count allowed him to	403.4422152301341
pay the homage he felt due to him.	352.90360196336
“In a month you will find on the table, at which we shall be then	375.5097830142292
sitting, good pistols and a delicious draught; but, on the other hand,	320.83694483332494
you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time.”	348.1289580373422
“Oh, I also swear it!”	413.2894043413532
Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him, and pressed him for some	482.63329076034483
time to his heart. “And now,” he said, “after today, you will come and	346.8337077092061
live with me; you can occupy Haydée’s apartment, and my daughter will	419.1540719647556
at least be replaced by my son.”	489.80578435193775
“Haydée?” said Morrel, “what has become of her?”	440.2017803163734
“She departed last night.”	384.1818602098776
“To leave you?”	395.16616639372035
“To wait for me. Hold yourself ready then to join me at the	404.515362476526
Champs-Élysées, and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	395.12080972188573
departure.”	432.8567758630144
Maximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike reverence.	434.51908626700464
 Chapter 106. Dividing the Proceeds	333.7077428388538
The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue	339.44046099304273
Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for	480.2056532928732
his mother, was let to a very mysterious person. This was a man whose	465.7354108327897
face the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin	301.6108496373184
was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen’s	339.4036377574737
coachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always	381.2253685157193
blowing his nose just as he approached the door. Contrary to custom,	441.46677759659764
this gentleman had not been watched, for as the report ran that he was	482.39177604850124
a person of high rank, and one who would allow no impertinent	401.0164756714961
interference, his _incognito_ was strictly respected.	350.9503078185144
His visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared a	305.5657051756217
little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and	466.27217447105136
winter, he took possession of his apartment about four o’clock, though	428.2046905295772
he never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the	444.56340660976764
fire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence	471.5040424407739
of the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the	343.6766461133749
table at the same hour. At four o’clock, as we have already stated, the	343.5917305781626
mysterious personage arrived.	362.90427702907925
Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady	339.59929794777446
alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled; she	327.60946873263634
passed like a shadow through the lodge, and ran upstairs without a	345.62496207639674
sound escaping under the touch of her light foot. No one ever asked her	404.8847065187009
where she was going. Her face, therefore, like that of the gentleman,	339.0176505323792
was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who were perhaps	437.72141141240957
unequalled throughout the capital for discretion. We need not say she	352.45454892773944
stopped at the first floor. Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a	404.4881285391296
door, which after being opened to admit her was again fastened, and	359.9318782093892
curiosity penetrated no farther. They used the same precautions in	316.72510953571253
leaving as in entering the house. The lady always left first, and as	489.1072444907604
soon as she had stepped into her carriage, it drove away, sometimes	339.5463038279911
towards the right hand, sometimes to the left; then about twenty	330.7531679319748
minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave, buried in his cravat	452.76369210179246
or concealed by his handkerchief.	314.75304446850987
The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious	383.952006633748
lodger entered at ten o’clock in the morning instead of four in the	438.89297709524567
afternoon. Almost directly afterwards, without the usual interval of	443.4803489293016
time, a cab arrived, and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs. The door	376.4514162364991
opened, but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed:	457.2582260103984
“Oh, Lucien—oh, my friend!”	304.78675597078717
The concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger’s name	488.8208461154637
was Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection of a door-keeper, he	480.19475247424737
made up his mind not to tell his wife.	330.9742396281232
“Well, what is the matter, my dear?” asked the gentleman whose name the	398.4426933862759
lady’s agitation revealed; “tell me what is the matter.”	382.8526071966859
“Oh, Lucien, can I confide in you?”	324.5291997650094
“Of course, you know you can do so. But what can be the matter? Your	470.14023176703495
note of this morning has completely bewildered me. This	370.39954015315135
precipitation—this unusual appointment. Come, ease me of my anxiety, or	370.12034074777245
else frighten me at once.”	362.58252213333526
“Lucien, a great event has happened!” said the lady, glancing	446.0273224823551
inquiringly at Lucien,—“M. Danglars left last night!”	434.21848819297884
“Left?—M. Danglars left? Where has he gone?”	491.3598380062931
“I do not know.”	377.5094287492504
“What do you mean? Has he gone intending not to return?”	391.38851075541936
“Undoubtedly;—at ten o’clock at night his horses took him to the	442.470298108546
barrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him—he	412.2608836920756
entered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to	384.4995326893415
Fontainebleau.”	317.8676481881927
“Then what did you mean——”	425.8019749565819
“Stay—he left a letter for me.”	428.747755776126
“A letter?”	419.136083522881
“Yes; read it.”	465.2037029803987
And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to	386.22572210184853
Debray. Debray paused a moment before reading, as if trying to guess	434.426276221193
its contents, or perhaps while making up his mind how to act, whatever	451.7762757081425
it might contain. No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes,	325.1603235374742
for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the	390.21025891815793
heart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:	314.84909208703004
“‘Madame and most faithful wife.’”	394.94638057912067
Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face	471.35935866219126
became covered with blushes.	465.05850311194945
“Read,” she said.	320.91992887773523
Debray continued:	410.2475387793436
“‘When you receive this, you will no longer have a husband. Oh, you	428.5717628389328
need not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your	359.5125958310031
daughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or	374.48642276751355
forty roads leading out of France. I owe you some explanations for my	385.77180873893195
conduct, and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me, I	409.5583701372089
will give them. Listen, then. I received this morning five millions	471.04226051211907
which I paid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the	344.8461600893313
same sum was presented to me; I put this creditor off till tomorrow and	371.53486486387067
I intend leaving today, to escape that tomorrow, which would be rather	436.4562748222486
too unpleasant for me to endure. You understand this, do you not, my	357.9183382360826
most precious wife? I say you understand this, because you are as	417.09309833487725
conversant with my affairs as I am; indeed, I think you understand them	357.45115697616035
better, since I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable	411.46614655407734
portion of my fortune, once very tolerable, while I am sure, madame,	315.71756662012837
that you know perfectly well. For women have infallible instincts; they	370.7742052373086
can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have	417.8345760141357
invented; but I, who only understand my own figures, know nothing more	486.3756471671727
than that one day these figures deceived me. Have you admired the	487.6143815806306
rapidity of my fall? Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden	401.7937378178767
fusion of my ingots? I confess I have seen nothing but the fire; let us	349.3153811374686
hope you have found some gold among the ashes. With this consoling	373.75841795214296
idea, I leave you, madame, and most prudent wife, without any	435.7801003550529
conscientious reproach for abandoning you; you have friends left, and	378.25445618752644
the ashes I have already mentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten	308.66472246786583
to restore to you. And here, madame, I must add another word of	417.7614970100815
explanation. So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our	367.6162318162976
house and for the fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my	442.4682546203718
eyes; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will	304.80150848060373
not be the foundation of another man’s fortune. You were rich when I	466.87559500234534
married you, but little respected. Excuse me for speaking so very	448.22023744003343
candidly, but as this is intended only for ourselves, I do not see why	429.1868160243097
I should weigh my words. I have augmented our fortune, and it has	377.87834336062383
continued to increase during the last fifteen years, till extraordinary	329.3366641054526
and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it,—without any	487.9481059945557
fault of mine, I can honestly declare. You, madame, have only sought to	421.26702465033236
increase your own, and I am convinced that you have succeeded. I leave	399.6547581087078
you, therefore, as I took you,—rich, but little respected. Adieu! I	308.33063149844094
also intend from this time to work on my own account. Accept my	315.2470780810988
acknowledgments for the example you have set me, and which I intend	317.97207484630553
following.	401.7041305708897
“‘Your very devoted husband,	416.2875218706261
“‘Baron Danglars.’”	426.1963835900607
The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful	460.9099262754555
letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color	471.32314139958646
once or twice. When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and	398.66281391323173
resumed his pensive attitude.	317.1959160879024
“Well?” asked Madame Danglars, with an anxiety easy to be understood.	329.04071260448006
“Well, madame?” unhesitatingly repeated Debray.	488.6434247993938
“With what ideas does that letter inspire you?”	365.3367865211487
“Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M.	466.60008232872883
Danglars has left suspiciously.”	462.9180530385637
“Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?”	413.9614729598461
“I do not understand you,” said Debray with freezing coldness.	406.66409660474324
“He is gone! Gone, never to return!”	404.8734795591362
“Oh, madame, do not think that!”	405.3154406730987
“I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is	322.5987489189853
inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests. If he could	367.53918153542736
have made any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me	425.64497964207567
in Paris, as our separation will conduce to his benefit;—therefore he	411.7086733761
has gone, and I am free forever,” added Madame Danglars, in the same	317.00912397338436
supplicating tone.	301.46167941558997
Debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude of	432.70174379278694
nervous inquiry.	498.8523007879309
“Well?” she said at length, “do you not answer me?”	316.4915446616192
“I have but one question to ask you,—what do you intend to do?”	391.8123444856319
“I was going to ask you,” replied the baroness with a beating heart.	315.65442471195195
“Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?”	475.68184677599163
“Yes; I do wish to ask your advice,” said Madame Danglars with anxious	342.0148352345056
expectation.	304.3666988660749
“Then if you wish to take my advice,” said the young man coldly, “I	432.010910115554
would recommend you to travel.”	424.2855122825425
“To travel!” she murmured.	448.47267629177446
“Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free. In	474.72464840344423
my opinion, a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the	299.26613379970956
double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars’ broken contract and M.	343.0595268264072
Danglars’ disappearance. The world will think you abandoned and poor,	455.45485622394267
for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep up	439.7811593817793
an appearance of opulence. You have only to remain in Paris for about a	320.10339948449064
fortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the	344.5186724935974
details of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread	382.5519020187175
the report. Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and	376.50605486620424
giving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with	362.2169436557797
praises of your disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and	299.2496542211585
think you also poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and	393.4169927097747
am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.”	345.9090588460822
The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this,	482.8506056354638
was equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken.	492.0881474305528
“Deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are	476.4194263037765
right, sir, and no one can doubt my position.”	337.3244096193593
These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman	369.7523989260119
could utter in response to Debray.	411.3473158784309
50137m	449.7884109051233
“But then you are rich,—very rich, indeed,” continued Debray, taking	433.94031827084035
out some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.	383.4416546674656
Madame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the	388.72273271934233
beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to	374.5911382010685
gush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not	475.8750933974284
entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the	321.0563448902339
fall of a single tear.	431.367315351158
“Madame,” said Debray, “it is nearly six months since we have been	413.3076996320883
associated. You furnished a principal of 100,000 francs. Our	471.5990672517882
partnership began in the month of April. In May we commenced	479.6166576177467
operations, and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs. In	395.41971292731324
June the profit amounted to 900,000. In July we added 1,700,000	391.9637649935763
francs,—it was, you know, the month of the Spanish bonds. In August we	391.1323647134891
lost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we	491.3603141765214
made up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the	454.0950692826369
first day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed a	487.982539357673
capital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,	387.96217446097324
madame,” said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical	442.67768700369277
manner of a stockbroker, “there are still 80,000 francs, the interest	447.3331765494288
of this money, in my hands.”	498.61223407176453
“But,” said the baroness, “I thought you never put the money out to	358.220092519648
interest.”	352.30495929207274
“Excuse me, madame,” said Debray coldly, “I had your permission to do	354.5879843824784
so, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000 francs for your	453.828789042455
share, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in	389.0676884308596
all 1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the	348.4829709546995
precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is	488.50499833451096
not long ago, you see, and I was in continual expectation of being	355.1665703301667
called on to deliver up my accounts. There is your money,—half in	335.0829816100124
bank-notes, the other half in checks payable to bearer. I say _there_,	393.22648562702153
for as I did not consider my house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently	475.9703064126081
discreet, and as landed property carries evidence with it, and moreover	391.1138728159052
since you have no right to possess anything independent of your	450.39600218850364
husband, I have kept this sum, now your whole fortune, in a chest	409.4966537225692
concealed under that closet, and for greater security I myself	410.1051583917284
concealed it there.	495.64490189470905
“Now, madame,” continued Debray, first opening the closet, then the	463.2203491740951
chest;—“now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each,	328.1163745062911
resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a	361.939668467574
certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash,	353.63146549257
making I think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker,	426.20698621067777
who, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest	445.0370339817197
assured.”	412.7260447883445
Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of	344.35793065019374
bank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the	347.9530596022775
table. Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving	467.6442408263838
with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the	380.21763615727224
certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and	433.7919882570502
mute, awaited one kind word of consolation.	318.0191715306952
But she waited in vain.	416.0021194938519
“Now, madame,” said Debray, “you have a splendid fortune, an income of	481.09615004019156
about 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot	484.446526966922
keep an establishment here for a year, at least. You will be able to	421.642625799621
indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income	365.05967721861356
insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of	425.1504028375659
mine; and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan.”	370.8186490808311
“Thank you, sir—thank you,” replied the baroness; “you forget that what	422.1642978731234
you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who	435.0530370064608
intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.”	339.5718022821741
Debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering	436.6788807364098
himself, he bowed with an air which seemed to say, “As you please,	435.38842377761296
madame.”	301.5207594528316
Madame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when	423.88417667711144
she saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was	454.87367543920726
accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her	321.1039604674444
head, and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran	402.4516878082308
downstairs, disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus	489.4084812950495
part from her.	390.29083586277704
“Bah,” said Debray, when she had left, “these are fine projects! She	436.93557317940144
will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she can	438.6405175936411
no longer do so on the Bourse.”	331.14080153431814
Then taking up his account book, he cancelled with the greatest care	440.36740039887
all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away.	468.13174570101523
“I have 1,060,000 francs remaining,” he said. “What a pity Mademoiselle	347.0951883983736
de Villefort is dead! She suited me in every respect, and I would have	435.1234155789598
married her.”	348.85741148937484
And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame	328.1163647179891
Danglars’ departure before he left the house. During this time he	308.1122291714965
occupied himself in making figures, with his watch by his side.	413.2002007807789
Asmodeus—that diabolical personage, who would have been created by	321.9919065190505
every fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in	428.1146986259895
his great masterpiece—would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if he	308.89793973631004
had lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue	409.8098496287095
Saint-Germain-des-Prés, while Debray was casting up his figures.	420.01970061010445
Above the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a	303.1437399821352
half with Madame Danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have	441.2307572868151
played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their	336.6745934556583
appearance not to create some interest.	448.13415777928566
Mercédès and Albert were in that room.	433.22564620510315
Mercédès was much changed within the last few days; not that even in	301.35968380992387
her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display	325.5070446915137
which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in	465.54664926423015
a plain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state	464.46976150008095
of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no,	370.6104071981879
the change in Mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips no	479.6564098626037
longer smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words	387.28792415954035
which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.	436.87423777118363
It was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of	332.452654326122
courage which rendered her poverty burdensome. Mercédès, although	391.0187362908504
deposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere	352.8216052614776
she had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly	482.128695755353
lighted into utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her	438.5227380207998
palace to a hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither	459.8326782003036
become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to	445.642343913339
place upon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her	441.6640819278891
bed.	492.90866450228657
The beautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud	388.12566381351644
glance and charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around	417.6077111229057
her; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical	384.2748038305616
landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was	391.2557540873526
uncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt	368.67146929737265
at luxury; indeed, everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement	326.84461745980417
and elegance.	497.19120164402676
Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the	374.44898019114214
continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert	325.52274445164346
continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings,	428.19325059793914
she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone,	445.25831113831293
which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually	359.37792359251
shone from her eyes, seemed like “moonlight on a statue,”—yielding	345.43275750003403
light without warmth.	374.39737044974345
Albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from	327.0008842053473
sinking into his actual position. If he wished to go out without	384.5735187479773
gloves, his hands appeared too white; if he wished to walk through the	331.0582119544348
town, his boots seemed too highly polished. Yet these two noble and	384.8012745939707
intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and	301.5259293779391
filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another, and	406.10115168765054
economizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell his mother	450.00321687310304
without extorting a change of countenance:	397.5527767986221
“Mother, we have no more money.”	358.68753415260005
50141m	495.79508593600815
Mercédès had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of	395.36745091003274
poverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there	302.4501098784042
is a wide difference.	419.25840720795384
Amongst the Catalans, Mercédès wished for a thousand things, but still	312.87542583290235
she never really wanted any. So long as the nets were good, they caught	301.8235139782434
fish; and so long as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine	404.35193305207576
for new nets. And then, shut out from friendship, having but one	456.09666854296563
affection, which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits, she	437.181887563181
thought of herself—of no one but herself. Upon the little she earned	368.76809626137685
she lived as well as she could; now there were two to be supported, and	436.26993653591376
nothing to live upon.	458.0439069929396
Winter approached. Mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked	436.5032927190338
room—she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the	326.18640223829925
hall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower—she whose	416.87831523850923
apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her	319.34304687434116
son. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.	459.5318853059868
Excitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the	490.24160382159454
things of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt	396.51668126190276
themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having	419.4827188571977
exhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.	338.2925644535594
“Mother,” exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the	466.63322933321643
stairs, “let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to	435.64959732705955
build my plans upon.”	434.880231137941
“Capital—nothing!” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile.	326.53992151446135
“No, mother,—capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our leading a	339.72982451300277
delightful life upon this 3,000 francs.”	408.32843534803305
“Child!” sighed Mercédès.	420.9119655154566
“Alas, dear mother,” said the young man, “I have unhappily spent too	437.3856039083356
much of your money not to know the value of it. These 3,000 francs are	481.27069932926145
enormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous	354.4339993021308
certainty for the future.”	300.1245079588815
“You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these	471.7435755460226
3,000 francs?” said Mercédès, coloring.	347.4509710477827
“I think so,” answered Albert in a firm tone. “We will accept them the	380.16347451948815
more readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in	483.3718897467046
the garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan, at Marseilles.	387.6137436906101
With 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.”	363.6043181675148
“With 200 francs?—are you sure, Albert?”	407.16240102264334
“Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and	407.9620102476886
steamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place in	406.93501007067096
the _coupé_ to Châlons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for	469.22241456739795
thirty-five francs.”	336.7553461391171
Albert then took a pen, and wrote:	397.1621516199124

“Let us put down 120,” added Albert, smiling. “You see I am generous,	308.0789488607488
am I not, mother?”	462.577287634117
“But you, my poor child?”	416.2961422819595
“I? do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself? A young man	358.94140716853053
does not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”	447.4459434580364
“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”	331.294191033723
“Any way, mother.”	468.6636857922273
“Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?”	317.5399577669198
“Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for 100	390.7548177290538
francs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the	344.3680864438078
ornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of	461.7426926940712
superfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs	478.871328542194
we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.”	405.30788148318175
“But we owe something in this house?”	299.558017006762
“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is	326.2456578197944
understood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see	365.52150986337665
I am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to	341.44827516055716
this, mother?”	476.2049056921221
And Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a	332.9200422131536
remnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of	445.53570349829954
the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little	348.5487591168679
door,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.	437.50889418499764
“What is this?” asked Mercédès.	358.99934011812894
“A thousand francs.”	391.52730367704606
“But whence have you obtained them?”	356.48686880177524
“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And	312.5472124943568
Albert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at	305.8675065933935
her. “You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!” said the	346.30028542126445
young man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. “You are,	324.45111701799783
indeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”	413.9385485209019
“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear	358.38334472310146
which glistened in the corner of her eye. “Indeed, you only wanted	312.88058291949335
misfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy	473.64651767358635
while I possess my son!”	495.5123505546739
“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial. Do you know the	356.72647784719123
decision we have come to, mother?”	384.63028100453784
“Have we come to any?”	379.61323266118495
“Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am	397.8389707070474
to leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the	388.741640589763
name I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.” Mercédès	333.46649219748554
sighed. “Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the	458.32470018832936
Spahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain	362.79188835134937
feeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his	328.32718495261446
self-abasement. “I thought my body was my own, and that I might sell	450.84368530897564
it. I yesterday took the place of another. I sold myself for more than	314.8264356240485
I thought I was worth,” he added, attempting to smile; “I fetched 2,000	465.32738123605577
francs.”	328.40614832697355
“Then these 1,000 francs——” said Mercédès, shuddering.	393.7895959368921
“Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.”	394.1337469890409
Mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be	432.5064039047289
impossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained,	490.42004490021594
now yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.	376.73113406458714
“The price of his blood!” she murmured.	408.69346319802867
“Yes, if I am killed,” said Albert, laughing. “But I assure you,	490.6363657293846
mother, I have a strong intention of defending my person, and I never	442.5247451890602
felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do now.”	466.1431271990479
“Merciful Heavens!”	343.5986388122761
“Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be	475.09615675001965
killed? Has Lamoricière, that Ney of the South, been killed? Has	383.2238309279472
Changarnier been killed? Has Bedeau been killed? Has Morrel, whom we	421.7311596275872
know, been killed? Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return	348.82951797245397
with an embroidered uniform! I declare, I expect to look magnificent in	395.34458883593237
it, and chose that regiment only from vanity.”	357.6249104128221
Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt	360.26316580370997
that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall	343.60889100140923
upon her son.	347.42105643006585
“Well, now you understand, mother!” continued Albert; “here are more	388.39681620353696
than 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two	478.2863160255092
years.”	340.0979188436675
“Do you think so?” said Mercédès.	460.0348244395246
These words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning	315.8613882475346
did not escape Albert; he felt his heart beat, and taking his mother’s	333.69398710843313
hand within his own he said, tenderly:	425.78840255161765
“Yes, you will live!”	373.49078066529705
“I shall live!—then you will not leave me, Albert?”	415.14147536288306
“Mother, I must go,” said Albert in a firm, calm voice; “you love me	471.12775038496767
too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, I	498.1912069384208
have signed.”	435.4189687316937
50145m	383.8295283913575
“You will obey your own wish and the will of Heaven!”	479.79784854503225
“Not my own wish, mother, but reason—necessity. Are we not two	343.09692169120206
despairing creatures? What is life to you?—Nothing. What is life to	312.0173990647049
me?—Very little without you, mother; for believe me, but for you I	416.54274128002356
should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced	377.70921585783293
his name. Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if	301.80887410252996
you grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my	429.9748953310673
strength. Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal	460.8821530466676
heart, and is essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story. I	362.5923178886536
will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he keep	336.669947598101
his word and interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an	378.81539708623995
officer, or dead. If I am an officer, your fortune is certain, for I	477.0424184576139
shall have money enough for both, and, moreover, a name we shall both	360.29550636678243
be proud of, since it will be our own. If I am killed—well then mother,	436.79071690349826
you can also die, and there will be an end of our misfortunes.”	398.48204124896154
“It is well,” replied Mercédès, with her eloquent glance; “you are	469.7537023579639
right, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that	462.7950075043793
we are worthy of compassion.”	390.5950221059263
“But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions,” said the young man; “I	416.4514145273657
assure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy. You are a woman	433.60765555782393
at once full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in my	399.924678704813
tastes, and am without passion, I hope. Once in service, I shall be	380.85320668923987
rich—once in M. Dantès’ house, you will be at rest. Let us strive, I	443.07167315457906
beseech you,—let us strive to be cheerful.”	430.79888950206987
“Yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, Albert.”	438.05934558454766
“And so our division is made, mother,” said the young man, affecting	340.4323973434156
ease of mind. “We can now part; come, I shall engage your passage.”	310.61693760701996
“And you, my dear boy?”	436.92660375091964
“I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves to	372.0308854969094
parting. I want recommendations and some information relative to	384.08212498892516
Africa. I will join you again at Marseilles.”	386.2880886605085
“Well, be it so—let us part,” said Mercédès, folding around her	399.23685431315664
shoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally	388.13065157734934
happened to be a valuable black cashmere. Albert gathered up his papers	497.64471815228393
hastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the	415.648478886209
landlord, and offering his arm to his mother, they descended the	468.50667468337474
stairs.	484.75041345521913
Someone was walking down before them, and this person, hearing the	496.90497597300873
rustling of a silk dress, turned around. “Debray!” muttered Albert.	447.6093041194371
“You, Morcerf?” replied the secretary, resting on the stairs. Curiosity	365.3344123199061
had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_, and he was	371.21745337643875
recognized. It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to find the	369.91139341383916
young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.	453.09188878763814
“Morcerf!” repeated Debray. Then noticing in the dim light the still	439.9504524826896
youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:	432.4671793452725
“Pardon me,” he added with a smile, “I leave you, Albert.” Albert	308.82339784876234
understood his thoughts.	316.07216634051866
“Mother,” he said, turning towards Mercédès, “this is M. Debray,	372.7866675964917
secretary of the Minister for the Interior, once a friend of mine.”	431.0111933201658
“How once?” stammered Debray; “what do you mean?”	495.29376995510495
“I say so, M. Debray, because I have no friends now, and I ought not to	339.25576253130413
have any. I thank you for having recognized me, sir.” Debray stepped	461.3314939680249
forward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor.	405.09248071599256
“Believe me, dear Albert,” he said, with all the emotion he was capable	374.3581155296587
of feeling,—“believe me, I feel deeply for your misfortunes, and if in	397.2656449270775
any way I can serve you, I am yours.”	315.05511475542136
“Thank you, sir,” said Albert, smiling. “In the midst of our	372.0258191422983
misfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from	424.61402932238934
anyone. We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall	353.15994609465366
have 5,000 francs left.”	409.34507207256195
The blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held a million in his	345.3591207878024
pocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting	427.2468643601593
that the same house had contained two women, one of whom, justly	475.6967796372403
dishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak,	491.9150667745224
while the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her misfortune, was	437.7858523490522
yet rich with a few deniers. This parallel disturbed his usual	299.92409142550343
politeness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered a few	346.65231825529315
words of general civility and ran downstairs.	421.0251149399687
That day the minister’s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to	486.673533787414
put up with from his ill-humor. But that same night, he found himself	490.93393411138766
the possessor of a fine house, situated on the Boulevard de la	474.58783873812195
Madeleine, and an income of 50,000 livres.	458.559067115893
The next day, just as Debray was signing the deed, that is about five	412.22973670158177
o’clock in the afternoon, Madame de Morcerf, after having	444.878304031798
affectionately embraced her son, entered the _coupé_ of the diligence,	323.4937559877286
which closed upon her.	481.20521055706854
A man was hidden in Lafitte’s banking-house, behind one of the little	314.1280732611092
arched windows which are placed above each desk; he saw Mercédès enter	406.9662376931015
the diligence, and he also saw Albert withdraw. Then he passed his hand	449.5770908270169
across his forehead, which was clouded with doubt.	371.99343711598624
“Alas,” he exclaimed, “how can I restore the happiness I have taken	427.98378729478713
away from these poor innocent creatures? God help me!”	489.53778844567034
 Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den	346.0881089817672
One division of La Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate	343.8828487438756
prisoners are confined, is called the court of Saint-Bernard. The	386.8502753262241
prisoners, in their expressive language, have named it the “Lions’	300.83560150998426
Den,” probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw	491.93227312772797
the bars, and sometimes the keepers also. It is a prison within a	405.7652904224693
prison; the walls are double the thickness of the rest. The gratings	413.95731049740203
are every day carefully examined by jailers, whose herculean	483.79988621978026
proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen	497.76446528510735
to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and	391.3877499294499
intelligence.	303.96489737836043
The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which	410.29439391537124
the sun glances obliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf	395.88487397715835
of moral and physical deformity. On this paved yard are to be	444.745858099935
seen,—pacing to and fro from morning till night, pale, careworn, and	487.28438226915466
haggard, like so many shadows,—the men whom justice holds beneath the	458.0702190787433
steel she is sharpening. There, crouched against the side of the wall	344.8873179976204
which attracts and retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes	485.9703162570904
talking to one another, but more frequently alone, watching the door,	441.72954408957054
which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or	415.32591755816406
to throw in another outcast from society.	395.3934761390938
The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the	299.3320221512163
reception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright	306.0546121491186
gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent	334.11454887496075
a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.	401.8312556897312
It is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when	386.50538404239717
we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between	422.45063776891715
those iron bars. And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is	398.8413813756499
looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered;	330.6152261142548
it is so rare for them to leave the Lions’ Den for any other place than	368.66968377432875
the barrier Saint-Jacques, the galleys! or solitary confinement.	325.96862081592803
In the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp	483.5230494385846
vapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had	492.1595347718943
excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the “Den,” might be	315.60149585963023
seen walking. The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an	318.5858474274188
elegant man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they	441.7862735155386
did not show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful	386.68875486874197
hands of the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were	304.97769318947593
still perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the	429.43363137133656
appearance of a new coat. He bestowed the same attention upon the	461.6023642927554
cambric front of a shirt, which had considerably changed in color since	362.5741142617908
his entrance into the prison, and he polished his varnished boots with	471.0117307955459
the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a	452.94045806471524
coronet.	417.8189423521707
Some of the inmates of the “Lions’ Den” were watching the operations of	432.88651801902574
the prisoner’s toilet with considerable interest.	348.5289615026189
“See, the prince is pluming himself,” said one of the thieves.	383.523966957506
“He’s a fine looking fellow,” said another; “if he had only a comb and	439.0708367730062
hair-grease, he’d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids.”	432.8334127288637
“His coat looks nearly new, and his boots are brilliant. It is pleasant	350.30127640972546
to have such well-dressed brethren; and those gendarmes behaved	328.7067335216845
shamefully. What jealousy; to tear such clothes!”	467.4714607932222
“He looks like a big-bug,” said another; “dresses in fine style. And,	322.02237235005117
then, to be here so young! Oh, what larks!”	313.3447872898158
Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket,	312.8145262841221
against which one of the keepers was leaning.	338.6403109851067
“Come, sir,” he said, “lend me twenty francs; you will soon be paid;	355.21198095965485
you run no risks with me. Remember, I have relations who possess more	365.1201067675062
millions than you have deniers. Come, I beseech you, lend me twenty	357.88812989616423
francs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is intolerable always to	404.34840109521207
be in a coat and boots! And what a coat, sir, for a prince of the	332.2483075598642
Cavalcanti!”	421.13811895590896
The keeper turned his back, and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even	487.7578665685685
laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so	472.6322133732897
many utter the same things,—indeed, he heard nothing else.	480.10192826919683
“Come,” said Andrea, “you are a man void of compassion; I’ll have you	312.3318993761599
turned out.”	337.90773298500187
This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud laugh. The	373.5925155879579
prisoners then approached and formed a circle.	343.8242043129743
“I tell you that with that wretched sum,” continued Andrea, “I could	363.80270359017027
obtain a coat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I	323.9839386404196
am daily expecting.”	359.65565828410007
“Of course—of course,” said the prisoners;—“anyone can see he’s a	461.77672947685414
gentleman!”	359.5263803247902
“Well, then, lend him the twenty francs,” said the keeper, leaning on	473.99086423188044
the other shoulder; “surely you will not refuse a comrade!”	342.48326730515424
50151m	373.9681518860803
“I am no comrade of these people,” said the young man, proudly, “you	300.13460175942987
have no right to insult me thus.”	322.73417643631217
The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm	326.43805709474725
gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his	495.0490848931986
own words than by the manner of the keeper. The latter, sure of	362.8924096944231
quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to	494.0048588567742
rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate	423.3738763524037
Andrea, and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long	433.0890387461029
day.	473.0250277365161
The thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, _“La	329.9635048134634
savate—La savate!”_26 a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a	447.8605131531702
comrade who may have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but	453.4208187062083
with an iron-heeled one. Others proposed the _anguille_, another kind	407.8856523587793
of recreation, in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles,	384.4854789089338
and two-sous pieces, when they have them, which the wretches beat like	419.0786103623618
a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer.	324.78498519828906
“Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman!” said others.	482.78665754634414
But Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue	436.92434272224705
around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a	361.99642274986394
hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. It was a	389.91656526425675
Masonic sign Caderousse had taught him. He was immediately recognized	320.16470880021063
as one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled	378.1148634058716
shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged.	440.32870152374676
Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he	419.7559790516603
intended to be civil, in his way, and that they would set the example	381.1454913867095
of liberty of conscience,—and the mob retired. The keeper was so	331.4086636721759
stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began	410.2327161047309
examining his person, attributing the sudden submission of the inmates	392.7411403753185
of the Lions’ Den to something more substantial than mere fascination.	425.5926485105823
Andrea made no resistance, although he protested against it. Suddenly a	472.59277686728075
voice was heard at the wicket.	327.8805320895111
“Benedetto!” exclaimed an inspector. The keeper relaxed his hold.	346.0351184575993
“I am called,” said Andrea.	382.6698162631893
“To the visitors’ room!” said the same voice.	443.25666033170324
“You see someone pays me a visit. Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether	438.57416090353524
a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!”	414.6032096204932
And Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out	304.35825767876184
through the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in	477.62171085851196
wonder. Certainly a call to the visitors’ room had scarcely astonished	362.82923239527577
Andrea less than themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use	477.7611379742581
of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force,	358.8629570891336
had maintained a rigid silence.	428.8568387159029
50153m	387.7057608581565
“Everything,” he said, “proves me to be under the protection of some	437.93643126409404
powerful person,—this sudden fortune, the facility with which I have	320.882161007992
overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an illustrious name	302.29311147681466
awarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most splendid	476.8921597468104
alliances about to be entered into. An unhappy lapse of fortune and the	458.726421464582
absence of my protector have cast me down, certainly, but not forever.	341.78028092196087
The hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth	415.79576758582186
to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into	357.05099057720844
the abyss. Why should I risk an imprudent step? It might alienate my	353.8850455704018
protector. He has two means of extricating me from this dilemma,—the	469.10287338308626
one by a mysterious escape, managed through bribery; the other by	487.4446833985339
buying off my judges with gold. I will say and do nothing until I am	362.70861197327633
convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then——”	446.6501123464646
Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate	347.4020373169688
youth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne	453.00435843684033
with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by	344.81940895788955
degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from	476.29187680194696
being naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort	355.31701097079844
that the inspector’s voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt	448.5331120515073
his heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining	361.62962781930764
magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or	348.4815419821074
the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the	303.51920094057675
grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his	395.436893572282
eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M.	495.7868847932509
Bertuccio, who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron	454.4515802181862
bars, the bolted doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other	306.05031193731713
grating.	331.83170200176966
“Ah,” said Andrea, deeply affected.	488.151160031276
“Good morning, Benedetto,” said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.	399.22642057683385
“You—you?” said the young man, looking fearfully around him.	395.91964475636235
“Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?”	432.6837819699839
“Silence,—be silent!” said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of	398.79023791880354
hearing possessed by the walls; “for Heaven’s sake, do not speak so	464.7145412042671
loud!”	450.0563017441186
“You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?” said Bertuccio.	324.55433078905594
“Oh, yes.”	387.7925288084368
“That is well.”	492.3532139678765
And Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper whom he saw	435.62301100555226
through the window of the wicket.	370.28997002991355
“Read?” he said.	382.71125952792306
“What is that?” asked Andrea.	352.6033822819824
“An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk to	306.79943169225356
me.”	492.3885719851902
“Oh,” cried Andrea, leaping with joy. Then he mentally added,—“Still my	419.9048598384834
unknown protector! I am not forgotten. They wish for secrecy, since we	387.2419477799708
are to converse in a private room. I understand, Bertuccio has been	465.1477295608273
sent by my protector.”	430.8648705291485
The keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron	340.80182586073715
gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor. The room was	332.9508728866418
whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant	323.49220615588814
to a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the	496.46701001406274
whole of its sumptuous furniture. Bertuccio sat down upon the chair,	403.9124497671979
Andrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.	330.7979864356595
“Now,” said the steward, “what have you to tell me?”	338.20964751157237
“And you?” said Andrea.	322.95226301935895
“You speak first.”	409.5880934485806
“Oh, no. You must have much to tell me, since you have come to seek	333.7409350799149
me.”	382.61498150897927
50155m	419.5342719751933
“Well, be it so. You have continued your course of villany; you have	327.14331256316194
robbed—you have assassinated.”	362.96505301253717
“Well, I should say! If you had me taken to a private room only to tell	361.25419452729113
me this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. I know all these	352.54633438627354
things. But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not	357.7331859830333
acquainted. Let us talk of those, if you please. Who sent you?”	412.92700909939845
“Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!”	478.43957081418813
“Yes, and to the point. Let us dispense with useless words. Who sends	452.01000299131414
you?”	398.6109710169337
“No one.”	495.02037109207373
“How did you know I was in prison?”	315.75245153988067
“I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so	442.91444479524273
gracefully mounted his horse in the Champs-Élysées.”	346.08797226864533
“Oh, the Champs-Élysées? Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of	350.11660185972266
pincette. The Champs-Élysées? Come, let us talk a little about my	484.75673165940003
father.”	458.694867001087
“Who, then, am I?”	302.90790609606745
“You, sir?—you are my adopted father. But it was not you, I presume,	387.7143278915433
who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five	362.75557809522905
months; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my	313.49499053791436
father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me	444.75931239679755
invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating at	427.48663065072185
this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in	310.9792421873661
Paris—amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I	369.56389443645907
did very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to	481.9310641462429
me just now;—it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two	363.36625378471985
millions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place.	489.4339215431558
Come, speak, my worthy Corsican, speak!”	412.4868716518397
“What do you wish me to say?”	433.23665179267675
“I will help you. You were speaking of the Champs-Élysées just now,	398.05230988072407
worthy foster-father.”	429.6043559904027
“Well?”	334.4229606628237
“Well, in the Champs-Élysées there resides a very rich gentleman.”	315.3704102605374
“At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?”	358.8376735630807
“I believe I did.”	451.1735977982962
“The Count of Monte Cristo?”	458.21754654848746
“’Tis you who have named him, as M. Racine says. Well, am I to rush	336.63468287555514
into his arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, ‘My father, my	489.3428319888135
father!’ like Monsieur Pixérécourt.”27	418.1260337027893
“Do not let us jest,” gravely replied Bertuccio, “and dare not to utter	314.54329719316485
that name again as you have pronounced it.”	461.20620591437944
“Bah,” said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of Bertuccio’s	497.696136022435
manner, “why not?”	386.0192629244749
“Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be	460.3246909391588
the father of such a wretch as you.”	398.7545395068205
“Oh, these are fine words.”	383.86076403598975
“And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.”	323.4453863500185
“Menaces—I do not fear them. I will say——”	372.30940775878554
“Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?” said	484.27168512386186
Bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that Andrea	460.4444211763753
was moved to the very soul. “Do you think you have to do with	449.0307690719688
galley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into	441.7726197331899
terrible hands; they are ready to open for you—make use of them. Do not	379.29255497800557
play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which	489.0925933439154
they can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their	452.4713316067342
movements.”	352.23132509035634
50157m	444.237069797113
“My father—I will know who my father is,” said the obstinate youth; “I	302.79878119985375
will perish if I must, but I _will_ know it. What does scandal signify	392.9241881188483
to me? What possessions, what reputation, what ‘pull,’ as Beauchamp	325.36503002831387
says,—have I? You great people always lose something by scandal,	478.4373982651009
notwithstanding your millions. Come, who is my father?”	443.0637133187768
“I came to tell you.”	348.7167204953017
“Ah,” cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. Just then the door	418.9209218294849
opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said:	318.76875367643356
“Excuse me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the	340.9977628416658
prisoner.”	446.2579857577221
“And so closes our interview,” said Andrea to the worthy steward; “I	494.5541602095169
wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!”	453.78748140052295
“I will return tomorrow,” said Bertuccio.	349.49557006103834
“Good! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few crowns	322.65734917664753
for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!”	334.67185318904706
“It shall be done,” replied Bertuccio.	341.5134575440603
Andrea extended his hand; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and	422.63635617538347
merely jingled a few pieces of money.	471.4273734049144
“That’s what I mean,” said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite overcome	318.42712984740115
by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio.	447.64978012048505
“Can I be deceived?” he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and	347.4696291233376
grated vehicle which they call “the salad basket.”	439.5755771804638
“Never mind, we shall see! Tomorrow, then!” he added, turning towards	437.7818943897453
Bertuccio.	378.4232764469418
“Tomorrow!” replied the steward.	322.2385832027365
 Chapter 108. The Judge	339.51935320920046
We remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the	478.97525799055273
chamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole	308.5636639061018
guardians of the young girl’s body. Perhaps it was the Christian	481.11721051881
exhortations of the abbé, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his	387.6004956343297
persuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever	373.21405667383897
since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded	473.6499380777461
to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive	408.3736126405095
affection for Valentine.	389.1068288636004
M. de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death.	445.70207821787903
The whole establishment had been changed; another valet was engaged for	329.4662910917229
himself, a new servant for Noirtier, two women had entered Madame de	299.72888417106003
Villefort’s service,—in fact, everywhere, to the concierge and	335.7710494855082
coachmen, new faces were presented to the different masters of the	418.66421979367215
house, thus widening the division which had always existed between the	455.63457277543307
members of the same family. The assizes, also, were about to begin, and	432.3344523285919
Villefort, shut up in his room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety	477.7089028840435
in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse. This affair,	383.50996085001935
like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered,	437.31192301727367
caused a great sensation in Paris. The proofs were certainly not	472.9567037153296
convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped	328.69282586965954
galley-slave on his death-bed, and who might have been actuated by	352.8890148923696
hatred or revenge in accusing his companion. But the mind of the	340.63976656114147
procureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and	300.64215172329233
he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his	467.29820842916007
self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen	338.22292313781577
heart.	412.12354092333527
The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of	451.5899824285343
Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming	438.0063535256495
assizes. He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to	429.74639491699907
evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the	348.1196532479619
purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	460.36815472246667
trial. And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor	392.81397145844437
Valentine, and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent,	333.61382559828127
that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional	475.78804899098844
duties, which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.	478.5036516216087
Once only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon	354.0091477878695
which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter	407.6058496644754
was to learn his father’s name. The magistrate, harassed and fatigued,	352.2649572779882
had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar	406.55077011663303
to that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began	347.33938972853184
knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the	364.31818482211486
rose-trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of	408.81220677039715
the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season.	309.0764868179411
More than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous	340.33187097334934
boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning	420.1529338481128
by the same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with	365.9043073637766
the same gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the	492.5925150036251
house, whence he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from	453.27895461971605
school to spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother.	449.96392972773197
While doing so, he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows,	493.7463329007444
where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of	445.4218576041991
the sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying	379.24728896706415
flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony.	300.02718544684717
The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could	396.4149745487058
scarcely distinguish. His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and	433.10268949484976
savage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been	487.78061552280025
pursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed.	470.0258090681067
Then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly	382.5986998424031
divested of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her	456.7743404087867
hand, the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her	307.9497301320339
son, or to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from	402.8502043320643
the drawing-room into the garden.	353.75850917645624
Villefort became pale; he understood the old man’s meaning.	465.9965717878439
Noirtier continued to look at the same object, but suddenly his glance	466.76191504398344
was transferred from the wife to the husband, and Villefort himself had	346.9962957566251
to submit to the searching investigation of eyes, which, while changing	327.2038573884586
their direction and even their language, had lost none of their	417.83114257661157
menacing expression. Madame de Villefort, unconscious of the passions	365.7750767250114
that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment held her son’s	442.90078819078974
ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss. Edward	498.0422397364248
begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not offering	460.43373965512285
sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it;	443.2722138199118
however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a cluster	448.17498737734803
of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead	372.4652113826585
streaming with perspiration. Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead,	332.16366875903714
pressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand	448.5364777056362
and some bonbons in the other.	312.1344403490585
Villefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird	400.1072963802533
to the serpent, walked towards the house. As he approached it,	390.1814962097287
Noirtier’s gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery	462.8125139736726
brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart.	464.1102058090445
In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a	333.5908030445237
terrible menace. Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to	491.062593491484
remind his son of a forgotten oath.	381.89353576856115
“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have	354.75436257558977
patience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.”	347.5888483799391
Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with	393.9419520207824
indifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his	400.28940739558936
greatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand	423.0439467072975
across his forehead, entered his study.	432.8849623932033
The night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but	301.84628205114007
Villefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the	488.2018560672657
morning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by	335.49047566448087
the examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses,	344.8032899468856
and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was	360.9448249242549
one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet	425.2799344723097
delivered.	301.581873412233
The next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning	463.2153607998218
dawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon	430.1100928696294
the lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a	349.4291644528767
short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its	310.10750477847085
flickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as	391.8342205851642
though they had been dipped in blood.	476.72179565430116
He opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and	457.16234632301865
seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief	437.39810484811164
on the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark	407.52143761607505
was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.	473.0257001245203
The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his	493.71874984225417
memory.	359.5357694109717
“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of	488.0131825941903
justice must strike wherever there is guilt.”	306.1195995321473
Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,	405.175462572484
where he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and	485.68074979746825
yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed	487.864510570225
the closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the	316.92542088029865
opening he had beheld the menacing old man.	348.85102174796714
“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”	407.52956492745585
His head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his	311.8204078973051
study; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to	394.66316368343894
sleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees	343.1325415822407
everyone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises	492.1296343325854
which accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,	331.3371045066892
the ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,	496.2001277476471
mingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the	461.4413825399734
enjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him	354.47316683171556
the papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.	470.60226194831006
“What are you bringing me?” said he.	439.2983916165414
“A cup of chocolate.”	376.4020245992574
“I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?”	483.7128154127498
“My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the	461.3067251244245
murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your	434.7352270733678
strength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the	486.67380966599467
sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.	485.9700013245915
The valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a	493.1328081111177
gloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion,	498.84246807575573
he swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought	489.3000824817167
that he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for	424.96853611903725
death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.	458.4269464570094
He then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been	328.1180849577247
terrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort	462.4905668061825
felt no effects.	407.51987874408144
The breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The	371.5134900254012
valet re-entered.	415.8634956512328
“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven	362.39903650546864
o’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”	364.8060211840982
“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”	445.5332782397564
“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know	383.5426698257284
if she is to accompany you, sir?”	324.8295506472902
“Where to?”	341.1026483111812
“To the Palais.”	357.9643769013946
“What to do?”	356.4444037785501
“My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.”	360.29608049526007
“Ah,” said Villefort, with a startling accent; “does she wish that?”	303.88099598037667
The servant drew back and said, “If you wish to go alone, sir, I will	325.22466852598006
go and tell my mistress.”	398.78523478671815
Villefort remained silent for a moment, and dented his pale cheeks with	486.98502691095734
his nails.	464.19938897170516
“Tell your mistress,” he at length answered, “that I wish to speak to	479.58648437537806
her, and I beg she will wait for me in her own room.”	438.5093589634237
“Yes, sir.”	374.0273392718819
“Then come to dress and shave me.”	462.36770009749495
“Directly, sir.”	372.1843294318777
The valet re-appeared almost instantly, and, having shaved his master,	467.0729233788826
assisted him to dress entirely in black. When he had finished, he said:	343.80592247459373
“My mistress said she should expect you, sir, as soon as you had	367.4606604120804
finished dressing.”	317.0256619536411
“I am going to her.”	431.1797784323826
And Villefort, with his papers under his arm and hat in hand, directed	319.7854066496034
his steps toward the apartment of his wife.	302.9392473993296
At the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp, pale brow. He then	321.19684803569635
entered the room. Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and	347.0860404620253
impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets	354.26285866582487
which young Edward, by way of amusing himself, was tearing to pieces	303.9963047513999
before his mother could finish reading them. She was dressed to go out,	441.5284643178171
her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair, and her gloves were on her	495.38471124357926
hands.	315.55934938334485
“Ah, here you are, monsieur,” she said in her naturally calm voice;	371.69939218611444
“but how pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not	397.9348104487998
come down to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take	490.6775699546233
Edward?”	441.539314396321
Madame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one	419.8293847335738
answer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold	337.3942221927194
as a statue.	357.9906291798062
“Edward,” said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on the child, “go	341.89977138456936
and play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak to your mamma.”	382.9524971013532
Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance,	396.39190106947694
that resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries. Edward	469.74793846958477
raised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that she did	417.21549948251504
not confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden	381.16411215309114
soldiers.	344.1382397731696
“Edward,” cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up	417.81376070930855
from the floor, “do you hear me?—Go!”	363.7700697203729
The child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling;	455.90701666157383
it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or	446.8833184021537
passion. His father went up to him, took him in his arms, and kissed	337.9760143273917
his forehead.	359.30115407195393
“Go,” he said: “go, my child.” Edward ran out.	393.33884345611074
M. de Villefort went to the door, which he closed behind the child, and	491.1231793577565
bolted.	467.232519987417
“Dear me!” said the young woman, endeavoring to read her husband’s	423.27848434666663
inmost thoughts, while a smile passed over her countenance which froze	349.96218200608746
the impassibility of Villefort; “what is the matter?”	456.17749654188844
“Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?” said the	406.2868540310767
magistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife	400.659558030326
and the door.	343.66411680521253
Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of	359.40415175529876
a bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its	357.2127907427748
head.	364.1582974816215
A hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from	497.11772949129363
her, while she became deadly pale.	401.1179055771995
“Monsieur,” she said, “I—I do not understand you.”	328.9887720049497
And, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the	433.05903992827166
sofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down	471.8279004800574
again on the cushions.	353.14842256503346
“I asked you,” continued Villefort, in a perfectly calm tone, “where	299.09985145822094
you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my	387.04112626152755
father-in-law, M. de Saint-Méran, my mother-in-law, Madame de	397.18835195543306
Saint-Méran, Barrois, and my daughter Valentine.”	333.956883795499
“Ah, sir,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, clasping her hands, “what do	466.63529213215566
you say?”	419.4229713651258
“It is not for you to interrogate, but to answer.”	482.3774445741967
“Is it to the judge or to the husband?” stammered Madame de Villefort.	361.290724500044
“To the judge—to the judge, madame!” It was terrible to behold the	431.3231946641106
frightful pallor of that woman, the anguish of her look, the trembling	436.1172602207547
of her whole frame.	370.17385665705257
“Ah, sir,” she muttered, “ah, sir,” and this was all.	372.52384286805164
“You do not answer, madame!” exclaimed the terrible interrogator. Then	330.86695782192646
he added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, “It is true,	486.7390911246308
then; you do not deny it!” She moved forward. “And you cannot deny it!”	425.813015029586
added Villefort, extending his hand toward her, as though to seize her	329.2835443024273
in the name of justice. “You have accomplished these different crimes	394.09576580314825
with impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose	497.91164783036277
affections for you blinded them. Since the death of Madame de	419.04584093393544
Saint-Méran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house. M.	399.73870805057516
d’Avrigny warned me of it. After the death of Barrois my suspicions	439.7934206497932
were directed towards an angel,—those suspicions which, even when there	315.3092867988803
is no crime, are always alive in my heart; but after the death of	446.8479777381942
Valentine, there has been no doubt in my mind, madame, and not only in	495.2977000006357
mine, but in those of others; thus your crime, known by two persons,	337.33420110644926
suspected by many, will soon become public, and, as I told you just	443.48594401204025
now, you no longer speak to the husband, but to the judge.”	414.2683836093979
50165m	345.51106610080893
The young woman hid her face in her hands.	310.6195721587125
“Oh, sir,” she stammered, “I beseech you, do not believe appearances.”	443.1882709907462
“Are you, then, a coward?” cried Villefort, in a contemptuous voice.	485.18869409480726
“But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards. Can you be a	368.6703200949321
coward, you, who have had the courage to witness the death of two old	313.99941752044
men and a young girl murdered by you?”	393.0177236781614
“Sir! sir!”	318.3752031418427
“Can you be a coward?” continued Villefort, with increasing excitement,	432.68747467858896
“you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?	449.27335320581835
_You_, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages	421.5482122611857
with a talent and precision almost miraculous? Have you, then, who have	469.2683714561255
calculated everything with such nicety, have you forgotten to calculate	445.6641039572747
one thing—I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to?	463.2510124965827
Oh, it is impossible—you must have saved some surer, more subtle and	397.5475704936439
deadly poison than any other, that you might escape the punishment that	423.1308244395681
you deserve. You have done this—I hope so, at least.”	428.0407461161327
Madame de Villefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.	421.39639322910864
“I understand,” he said, “you confess; but a confession made to the	336.11162439750655
judges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime	349.87827371069176
cannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the	478.362710121364
guilty!”	474.0374380606796
“The punishment?” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, “the punishment,	361.64849112282974
monsieur? Twice you have pronounced that word!”	373.13723335167435
“Certainly. Did you hope to escape it because you were four times	361.7241951466293
guilty? Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are	385.9206070540371
the wife of him who pronounces it?—No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits	449.5279339392745
the poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner	325.8664073675091
has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her	431.82107254590267
deadliest poison.”	487.0014240629812
Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous and	437.471405314776
uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features.	429.6239057872536
“Oh, do not fear the scaffold, madame,” said the magistrate; “I will	436.48775746335855
not dishonor you, since that would be dishonor to myself; no, if you	383.315806093374
have heard me distinctly, you will understand that you are not to die	393.95401437883163
on the scaffold.”	317.36318831571646
“No, I do not understand; what do you mean?” stammered the unhappy	300.67864375916486
woman, completely overwhelmed.	421.43038100623914
“I mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not,	462.38047524128285
by her infamy, soil an unblemished name; that she shall not, with one	437.8333554213875
blow, dishonor her husband and her child.”	378.95699613361234
“No, no—oh, no!”	478.01041557221583
“Well, madame, it will be a laudable action on your part, and I will	326.94288314124435
thank you for it!”	320.3900299134149
“You will thank me—for what?”	337.7374780975071
“For what you have just said.”	318.5144965605395
“What did I say? Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.	341.2131287448435
Oh, my God, my God!”	476.67129579330776
And she rose, with her hair dishevelled, and her lips foaming.	313.9084615760008
“Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the	368.193239944869
room?—where do you keep the poison you generally use, madame?”	470.0191534837158
Madame de Villefort raised her arms to heaven, and convulsively struck	388.1716076074348
one hand against the other.	482.4421610566418
“No, no,” she vociferated, “no, you cannot wish that!”	449.94394323296825
50169m	438.36353581344093
“What I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.	432.06964727028566
Do you understand?” asked Villefort.	307.8338069556333
“Oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!”	347.03836881578843
“What I require is, that justice be done. I am on the earth to punish,	355.3368797294528
madame,” he added, with a flaming glance; “any other woman, were it the	327.9066896987758
queen herself, I would send to the executioner; but to you I shall be	336.55759235888985
merciful. To you I will say, ‘Have you not, madame, put aside some of	342.09849022459224
the surest, deadliest, most speedy poison?’”	326.6126572787145
50170m	354.33004448289466
“Oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!”	335.0585607603796
“She is cowardly,” said Villefort.	328.86915752240725
“Reflect that I am your wife!”	351.99840526254707
“You are a poisoner.”	384.535437803695
“In the name of Heaven!”	433.7583949437347
“No!”	472.62918600618127
“In the name of the love you once bore me!”	319.00450347532257
“No, no!”	442.6241349088714
“In the name of our child! Ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!”	480.0088561446644
50167m	354.28502747127993
“No, no, no, I tell you; one day, if I allow you to live, you will	454.3157144504562
perhaps kill him, as you have the others!”	313.9305274686002
“I?—I kill my boy?” cried the distracted mother, rushing toward	312.05966236509556
Villefort; “I kill my son? Ha, ha, ha!” and a frightful, demoniac laugh	330.63389171647316
finished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle.	492.5961398723622
Madame de Villefort fell at her husband’s feet. He approached her.	407.34189559015044
“Think of it, madame,” he said; “if, on my return, justice has not been	382.3463901380158
satisfied, I will denounce you with my own mouth, and arrest you with	414.21998456893635
my own hands!”	485.4519757717212
She listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and	379.9206990320324
glared horribly.	443.47226935257345
“Do you understand me?” he said. “I am going down there to pronounce	425.4832364107906
the sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you alive on my	393.57835436011675
return, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.”	432.350821262709
Madame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the	308.62169370901165
carpet. The king’s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity;	378.4066192268056
he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly:	457.29250690856185
“Farewell, madame, farewell!”	340.44574604033426
That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner’s knife.	395.35827248092176
She fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the	447.51934503328494
door.	329.09815542373593
 Chapter 109. The Assizes	306.5452798870035
The Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in	394.6631140911403
general, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Café de	328.1346018294387
Paris, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his	399.53858783216526
brief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of	465.74695623315364
acquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as	426.95625777379416
the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been	312.5090631019513
personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a	478.83066299358467
lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble	448.46491966949065
in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of	487.1565768523093
his comrade in chains.	324.13914280442987
In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least	341.4894387137065
an instance of, the fallibility of the law. M. Cavalcanti, his father,	486.07108377191946
had been seen in Paris, and it was expected that he would re-appear to	372.11195082934057
claim the illustrious outcast. Many, also, who were not aware of the	304.06888224578626
circumstances attending his withdrawal from Paris, were struck with the	388.37276019234747
worthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and the knowledge of the	399.9076160309053
world displayed by the old patrician, who certainly played the nobleman	317.6060739005483
very well, so long as he said nothing, and made no arithmetical	317.11156055309766
calculations.	318.57191915451176
As for the accused himself, many remembered him as being so amiable, so	447.16258483391886
handsome, and so liberal, that they chose to think him the victim of	331.203289929255
some conspiracy, since in this world large fortunes frequently excite	336.5932828532755
the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy.	482.80150100861533
Everyone, therefore, ran to the court; some to witness the sight,	310.5633524648331
others to comment upon it. From seven o’clock in the morning a crowd	490.0174049923064
was stationed at the iron gates, and an hour before the trial commenced	430.69194026922014
the hall was full of the privileged. Before the entrance of the	384.92252573103144
magistrates, and indeed frequently afterwards, a court of justice, on	447.52074805465924
days when some especial trial is to take place, resembles a	447.673268527132
drawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if	390.9985334502887
they can do so without losing their seats; or, if they are separated by	392.7870891234927
too great a number of lawyers, communicate by signs.	343.73473773201596
It was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short	301.38854800058294
summer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise had	456.26018643719766
all disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most	486.64903956922785
brilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor.	373.6652834165052
Beauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the	454.6230921154896
right of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.	399.8498785184579
He perceived Château-Renaud and Debray, who had just gained the good	347.47079551227455
graces of a sergeant-at-arms, and who had persuaded the latter to let	367.6613271936189
them stand before, instead of behind him, as they ought to have done.	480.606377733284
The worthy sergeant had recognized the minister’s secretary and the	435.6440940620581
millionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble	308.92139875761666
neighbors, promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to	492.32377428054605
Beauchamp.	414.58537961277796
“Well,” said Beauchamp, “we shall see our friend!”	459.77291174775075
“Yes, indeed!” replied Debray. “That worthy prince. Deuce take those	321.95327102272427
Italian princes!”	428.54869530075325
“A man, too, who could boast of Dante for a genealogist, and could	407.4406122094442
reckon back to the _Divina Comedia_.”	411.4045363660414
“A nobility of the rope!” said Château-Renaud phlegmatically.	486.31343705011324
“He will be condemned, will he not?” asked Debray of Beauchamp.	446.14881346720284
“My dear fellow, I think we should ask you that question; you know such	466.443285384834
news much better than we do. Did you see the president at the	327.0634427608577
minister’s last night?”	319.34044168988714
“Yes.”	395.37242835455044
“What did he say?”	375.2294936683249
“Something which will surprise you.”	353.99591900571284
“Oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has	334.1561777888124
happened.”	319.19396305736694
“Well, he told me that Benedetto, who is considered a serpent of	463.0009249115857
subtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace,	381.84664994236425
silly rascal, and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be	339.4250707016151
made on his phrenological organs after his death.”	445.26480465915876
“Bah,” said Beauchamp, “he played the prince very well.”	395.2417947254296
“Yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, Beauchamp, and are	470.5862869766795
always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover	445.81946027890234
a gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like	348.911721728814
a very bloodhound of heraldry.”	425.6977046707622
“Then you never believed in the principality?”	496.9390152447204
“Yes.—in the principality, but not in the prince.”	344.003713553234
“Not so bad,” said Beauchamp; “still, I assure you, he passed very well	334.0800635479683
with many people; I saw him at the ministers’ houses.”	491.0045198813012
“Ah, yes,” said Château-Renaud. “The idea of thinking ministers	474.2390962372181
understand anything about princes!”	458.18177459043807
“There is something in what you have just said,” said Beauchamp,	440.3885374761992
laughing.	447.6688000224366
“But,” said Debray to Beauchamp, “if I spoke to the president, _you_	406.4649144499078
must have been with the procureur.”	441.55103738920417
“It was an impossibility; for the last week M. de Villefort has	465.90526935827955
secluded himself. It is natural enough; this strange chain of domestic	491.79100998885326
afflictions, followed by the no less strange death of his daughter——”	386.26919204384194
“Strange? What do you mean, Beauchamp?”	478.3107943455672
“Oh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the	313.02262726464073
minister’s?” said Beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he	467.6336579559928
tried to make it remain.	337.96065369248237
“My dear sir,” said Château-Renaud, “allow me to tell you that you do	422.32106240717957
not understand that manœuvre with the eye-glass half so well as Debray.	310.11719281036477
Give him a lesson, Debray.”	494.17663025451293
“Stay,” said Beauchamp, “surely I am not deceived.”	302.1564835010788
“What is it?”	300.08739198257877
“It is she!”	457.8240809385493
“Whom do you mean?”	364.7982942405042
“They said she had left.”	345.99560841940064
“Mademoiselle Eugénie?” said Château-Renaud; “has she returned?”	445.7103036764985
“No, but her mother.”	495.6556714003765
“Madame Danglars? Nonsense! Impossible!” said Château-Renaud; “only ten	404.85757191447726
days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the	313.69588596464337
bankruptcy of her husband?”	391.03218334520756
Debray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of	323.20958879641336
Beauchamp’s glance.	496.73095838207405
“Come,” he said, “it is only a veiled lady, some foreign princess,	452.84222396417584
perhaps the mother of Cavalcanti. But you were just speaking on a very	497.88453311834667
interesting topic, Beauchamp.”	354.4432378342096
“I?”	428.9670702341516
“Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine.”	402.68642902130216
“Ah, yes, so I was. But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not	324.91733904669877
here?”	389.54275152004647
“Poor, dear woman,” said Debray, “she is no doubt occupied in	354.507873942384
distilling balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself	489.5039018538237
or friends. Do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year	477.57684779859034
in this amusement? But I wonder she is not here. I should have been	482.8230946735654
pleased to see her, for I like her very much.”	347.10789563226274
“And I hate her,” said Château-Renaud.	358.9017599671996
“Why?”	462.8507959950027
“I do not know. Why do we love? Why do we hate? I detest her, from	488.20820370473393
antipathy.”	337.5863635440784
“Or, rather, by instinct.”	469.83289313748446
“Perhaps so. But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp.”	428.4107650407093
“Well, do you know why they die so multitudinously at M. de	424.519820087949
Villefort’s?”	363.0549025334443
“‘Multitudinously’ is good,” said Château-Renaud.	483.4551902488008
“My good fellow, you’ll find the word in Saint-Simon.”	323.4048272074168
“But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort’s; but let’s get back to	303.81900453572956
the subject.”	461.68439535209785
“Talking of that,” said Debray, “Madame was making inquiries about that	472.54227082947193
house, which for the last three months has been hung with black.”	314.70523621484
“Who is Madame?” asked Château-Renaud.	331.8332365612128
“The minister’s wife, _pardieu!_”	446.917809252432
“Oh, your pardon! I never visit ministers; I leave that to the	429.9299023555228
princes.”	463.20088984668826
“Really, you were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant;	398.3747678775512
take compassion on us, or, like Jupiter, you will wither us up.”	312.04882055609045
“I will not speak again,” said Château-Renaud; “pray have compassion	307.67266569019324
upon me, and do not take up every word I say.”	333.419892403324
“Come, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, Beauchamp; I	406.5089391142219
told you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject;	437.94067896538536
enlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her.”	344.86872618462996
“Well, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (I like the	395.84200171707636
word) at M. de Villefort’s is that there is an assassin in the house!”	454.9928967354102
The two young men shuddered, for the same idea had more than once	326.0789592944689
occurred to them.	436.82020625719264
“And who is the assassin;” they asked together.	398.72892298096974
“Young Edward!” A burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the	423.0508060005418
least disconcert the speaker, who continued,—“Yes, gentlemen; Edward,	350.5978197664431
the infant phenomenon, who is quite an adept in the art of killing.”	452.5025104816731
“You are jesting.”	406.53994299327906
“Not at all. I yesterday engaged a servant, who had just left M. de	465.09337968764885
Villefort—I intend sending him away tomorrow, for he eats so	449.58155470557216
enormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in	376.09345661782874
that house. Well, now listen.”	320.03801567488296
“We are listening.”	384.37266218674154
“It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle	349.70683846475686
containing some drug, which he every now and then uses against those	444.7110616985973
who have displeased him. First, M. and Madame de Saint-Méran incurred	392.3673914368843
his displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir—three drops	380.9851789542859
were sufficient; then followed Barrois, the old servant of M. Noirtier,	436.98955962776313
who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch—he therefore received the	335.24592978936323
same quantity of the elixir; the same happened to Valentine, of whom he	420.2760786907517
was jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over	361.37789316702424
for her as well as the rest.”	390.8860908263848
“Why, what nonsense are you telling us?” said Château-Renaud.	349.9377801009827
“Yes, it is an extraordinary story,” said Beauchamp; “is it not?”	433.1637769965645
“It is absurd,” said Debray.	328.9983837580599
“Ah,” said Beauchamp, “you doubt me? Well, you can ask my servant, or	472.5342492102089
rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow, it was the talk	424.9592317100096
of the house.”	450.80763135118366
“And this elixir, where is it? what is it?”	314.4277251123639
“The child conceals it.”	334.917758662886
“But where did he find it?”	329.9674447460686
“In his mother’s laboratory.”	377.2267902517159
“Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?”	422.8865942297037
“How can I tell? You are questioning me like a king’s attorney. I only	489.62614722287367
repeat what I have been told, and like my informant I can do no more.	356.4299558228469
The poor devil would eat nothing, from fear.”	332.1868404724633
“It is incredible!”	471.7495334475238
“No, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible. You saw the child	415.0573877922734
pass through the Rue Richelieu last year, who amused himself with	304.00175660463583
killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while	478.6455271234171
they slept. The generation who follow us are very precocious.”	402.8326690258542
“Come, Beauchamp,” said Château-Renaud, “I will bet anything you do not	492.7413072445069
believe a word of all you have been telling us. But I do not see the	416.51758794088823
Count of Monte Cristo here.”	350.3072130875134
“He is worn out,” said Debray; “besides, he could not well appear in	318.11174745859785
public, since he has been the dupe of the Cavalcanti, who, it appears,	347.5660273955133
presented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated	328.72618116122266
him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.”	324.08199211457895
“By the way, M. de Château-Renaud,” asked Beauchamp, “how is Morrel?”	357.60208220753236
“_Ma foi_, I have called three times without once seeing him. Still,	490.6551683075654
his sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not	325.4798455419697
seen him for two or three days, she was sure he was well.”	304.1426258659341
“Ah, now I think of it, the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the	393.4150277262371
hall,” said Beauchamp.	446.9964182238784
“Why not?”	413.315201055331
“Because he is an actor in the drama.”	337.3887415732904
“Has he assassinated anyone, then?”	340.104216796936
“No, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. You know that it	312.2079219191848
was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his	496.32818096980594
friend Benedetto. You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his	497.0300992075371
house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the	343.5804738255342
marriage-contract. Do you see the waistcoat? There it is, all	388.5165297960415
blood-stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.”	365.1809511479906
“Ah, very good.”	471.50560490450556
“Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.”	422.70422391254925
A noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with	392.1823990898365
an energetic “hem!” and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that	368.2138538507889
shrill voice peculiar to his order, ever since the days of	400.6480861830677
Beaumarchais:	466.3672090616425
“The court, gentlemen!”	329.2833534659406
 Chapter 110. The Indictment	447.87001407778234
The judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence;	329.32997984230656
the jury took their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual	433.3572090791379
attention, and we had almost said of general admiration, sat in the	369.570451952795
armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him. Everyone looked with	302.68167401408533
astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression	384.1394607809301
personal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who	457.95645345355496
was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like	372.32645442110913
terror.	402.61446465013785
“Gendarmes,” said the president, “lead in the accused.”	336.1792833865556
At these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes	348.4061980430921
were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter. The	413.8139124058491
door soon opened and the accused appeared.	383.3465034868532
The same impression was experienced by all present, and no one was	394.4837009769417
deceived by the expression of his countenance. His features bore no	420.8044036417855
sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and	312.6519201475445
blanches the cheek. His hands, gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the	387.4776850599403
other in the opening of his white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous;	472.1484208952144
his eye was calm and even brilliant. Scarcely had he entered the hall	350.242346482786
when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants; his	381.48136622878553
eye rested longer on the president, and still more so on the king’s	396.72213335979603
attorney.	410.02129484444276
By the side of Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his	351.6198050350766
defence, and who had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained	438.4311530163549
to pay any attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach	476.0298244350541
no importance. The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face	324.4741057102464
expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized	425.8294689878851
the prisoner.	478.72111738795377
50181m	423.5750840308373
The president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the	487.1316508763791
clever and implacable pen of Villefort. During the reading of this,	387.15250420654485
which was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards	314.46034268627506
Andrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had	493.628187606079
never been so concise and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most	390.3432203525555
vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a	484.7712377805625
review of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all	389.22886615396516
the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like	353.02921729238585
that of the procureur. Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public	341.1461156252322
opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced.	395.8205781681352
Andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought	303.3229259608111
against him. M. de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no	348.92743652225045
doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was	327.7850965261683
accustomed to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes,	494.635793296813
notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze. At length the	410.7944086727067
reading of the indictment was ended.	316.50734928319196
“Accused,” said the president, “your name and surname?”	479.9230913286898
Andrea arose.	449.33759982042
“Excuse me, Mr. President,” he said, in a clear voice, “but I see you	427.80634295003233
are going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow	459.7553021166192
you. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an	350.7297629564736
exception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you	461.56411726325496
please, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.”	495.3294068566705
The astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at	311.4656382452103
Villefort. The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea	482.2500928286753
appeared quite unmoved.	421.2443212421746
“Your age?” said the president; “will you answer that question?”	391.68230721045506
“I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President, but	412.4194738019316
in its turn.”	483.08121043311235
“Your age?” repeated the president.	329.6735308984537
“I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I	471.32720765753413
was born the night of the 27th of September, 1817.”	464.5949268168573
M. de Villefort, who was busy taking down some notes, raised his head	310.20263634192366
at the mention of this date.	348.946033140341
“Where were you born?” continued the president.	421.10420272262735
“At Auteuil, near Paris.”	439.690417648437
M. de Villefort a second time raised his head, looked at Benedetto as	372.1416175988908
if he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and became livid. As for	481.2911962546653
Benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric	480.73891815921786
pocket-handkerchief.	394.81667711111453
“Your profession?”	414.2641981139881
“First I was a forger,” answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; “then I	464.33410399000354
became a thief, and lately have become an assassin.”	386.2183119679699
A murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the	305.64013953812866
assembly. The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury	366.57442887112074
manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of	408.4513847213567
fashion. M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at	440.05775896388343
first pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and	461.34847807946846
looked around as though he had lost his senses—he wanted air.	349.77504563857394
50183m	465.0590945172785
“Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?” asked Benedetto, with	428.6189517593358
his most ingratiating smile.	308.7580451064418
M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down	336.093203717144
again upon his chair.	331.4891477042724
“And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the	350.6225193292184
president. “The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and	464.05681577313624
classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the	353.49994699557715
court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to	461.4459851843618
humanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be	322.52813945072387
for this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name. You	378.7477872991406
wished it to be preceded by all these titles.”	303.45444385793184
“It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my	330.7381197939881
thoughts,” said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.	322.4495027678453
“This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the	422.9957444866727
questions.”	436.83164953038914
The public astonishment had reached its height. There was no longer any	494.0935860637122
deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience felt that	310.8293329935857
a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.	319.67292309321454
“Well,” said the president; “your name?”	339.8443802995281
“I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my	497.65866482268757
father’s, and can tell it to you.”	301.7491371276132
A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat	443.2303843706859
fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.	438.5613941358744
“Repeat your father’s name,” said the president.	457.59721738799414
Not a whisper, not a breath, was heard in that vast assembly; everyone	379.5405992091063
waited anxiously.	472.2487337503967
“My father is king’s attorney,” replied Andrea calmly.	383.51336632634826
50179m	490.3574686609354
“King’s attorney?” said the president, stupefied, and without noticing	304.6689667777573
the agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort; “king’s	408.51703111212527
attorney?”	468.12592736580393
“Yes; and if you wish to know his name, I will tell it,—he is named	477.0727228141121
Villefort.”	395.1880575430492
The explosion, which had been so long restrained from a feeling of	496.40393018094153
respect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder from the	356.7063784928946
breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to restrain the	438.9339330844367
feelings of the audience. The exclamations, the insults addressed to	363.40294418855035
Benedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the energetic gestures,	446.7631367630793
the movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the scum of the crowd	337.19405460321997
always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance—all this	475.6883484319259
lasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and magistrates were able	341.6989267219244
to restore silence. In the midst of this tumult the voice of	496.37098627319233
the president was heard to exclaim:	451.4042142060612
“Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your	480.25315137000894
fellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has	413.30432686184577
never been equalled?”	318.03087600198006
Several persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over	382.18938875239473
in his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and	433.08498056265887
protestations of zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the	461.0703745422667
hall, except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one	420.3678879861566
another. A lady, it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her	354.06944332983056
with a smelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of	412.5358453705703
tumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then,	321.53228655309636
leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most	361.52561666201433
graceful attitude possible, he said:	484.2165344282019
“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of	317.7869942072771
making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable	470.7821715387807
assembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I	439.53861140888625
answer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned	461.2738243983856
me. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can	430.6647195477169
tell them my father’s. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de	434.02277710205294
Villefort, and I am ready to prove it.”	311.5243264518367
There was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the	345.4945551817983
young man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment	387.4033002906368
towards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt	300.7457941675961
had changed him into a corpse.	495.10522938199784
“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner;	463.56218545475065
“I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”	359.7483290959212
“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto,	440.67147924273627
declared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”	464.0192612282011
“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have	332.1381296717548
just made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have	484.09825346679975
been the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of	468.87300152344596
the 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.	302.73683573584833
de Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I	334.40753692054926
was born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;	420.00958959394967
my father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me	470.5329135887944
in a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,	471.1527198322284
where he buried me alive.”	331.3963867003428
A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of	467.62027580618957
the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.	418.1634475931892
“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the	471.34790603359625
president.	348.71450435366296
“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against	318.2540909646187
my father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had	445.76606106816996
introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried	497.0868854254592
me. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in	318.7310743650228
the ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain	399.5196710182686
some treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The	399.2048978798629
man carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under	345.5799620389125
the number 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano	374.3346183326676
to Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me	329.25259404744486
away. Thus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in	390.2962125779847
Corsica.”	327.0974943392931
There was a moment’s silence, during which one could have fancied the	403.69676602710194
hall empty, so profound was the stillness.	318.5885455891455
“Proceed,” said the president.	479.4090363565916
“Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who	401.2615241593216
adored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which	339.2803985542226
my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in	305.81929606988865
wickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for	305.06209132822664
making me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father	370.8476527400851
said to me, ‘Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your	487.75575299312993
father, not yours,—of your father, who consigned you to hell if you	340.1393566886454
died, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.’ After that I	494.7066331352489
ceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have uttered	341.42215707589014
the words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this whole	322.9610930553474
assembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime, punish	366.0638399692663
me, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate	455.18348223348926
has been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.”	374.6299555837194
“But your mother?” asked the president.	317.33390380132226
“My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish to	383.09667124272585
know her name, nor do I know it.”	432.31518019906315
Just then a piercing cry, ending in a sob, burst from the centre of the	384.6564727516296
crowd, who encircled the lady who had before fainted, and who now fell	426.38641310583404
into a violent fit of hysterics. She was carried out of the hall, the	438.00864472905806
thick veil which concealed her face dropped off, and Madame Danglars	381.2640784315159
was recognized. Notwithstanding his shattered nerves, the ringing	404.41349026195104
sensation in his ears, and the madness which turned his brain,	386.7500963959328
Villefort rose as he perceived her.	371.5551066289121
“The proofs, the proofs!” said the president; “remember this tissue of	326.109504029894
horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.”	487.386115433991
“The proofs?” said Benedetto, laughing; “do you want proofs?”	402.0415045349088
“Yes.”	440.8747099553957
“Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.”	422.9620589737441
Everyone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the	433.945423147924
universal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the	467.8252178486415
midst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented	395.4143726398965
with the mark of his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of	422.3443551537868
astonishment.	417.1919542326533
“Father,” said Benedetto, “I am asked for proofs, do you wish me to	483.20897739823147
give them?”	433.47154348374374
“No, no, it is useless,” stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice;	326.15141939247263
“no, it is useless!”	395.4897787876871
“How useless?” cried the president, “what do you mean?”	416.3338381817531
“I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly	381.7084913686385
weight which crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an	463.8250986504205
avenging God! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man	375.80511790701695
is true.”	315.51541196011266
A dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon	457.31262011383075
of nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay.	457.62643970933834
“What, M. de Villefort,” cried the president, “do you yield to an	437.2454285395437
hallucination? What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?	463.45973821305466
This strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your	426.0367462063843
reason. Come, recover.”	435.626318561464
The procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man	401.9769774442581
under a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.	441.28657313267934
“I am in possession of all my senses, sir,” he said; “my body alone	380.49788112798774
suffers, as you may suppose. I acknowledge myself guilty of all the	498.55179778685465
young man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under	349.44416192127164
the authority of the procureur who will succeed me.”	439.2477664440141
And as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered	405.9503296919112
towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper. The	324.50302863855626
whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and	322.38105858621344
confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that	426.55729973857956
which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian	484.1016399782378
world.	478.76210656276135
“Well,” said Beauchamp, “let them now say that drama is unnatural!”	409.4520658500559
“_Ma foi!_” said Château-Renaud, “I would rather end my career like M.	358.373905970662
de Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this	338.7224448984767
catastrophe.”	406.86919783844365
“And moreover, it kills,” said Beauchamp.	390.6559126843997
“And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter,” said	321.0783355759447
Debray. “She did well to die, poor girl!”	419.8286993431841
“The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,” said the president; “fresh	376.0140172165636
inquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next session by	340.77124112134925
another magistrate.”	423.1378818829888
As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting than ever, he left the	453.6242549736438
hall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily paid him some attention.	338.99998015447187
“Well, what do you think of this, my fine fellow?” asked Debray of the	317.49356574441947
sergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his hand.	391.9425940094836
“There will be extenuating circumstances,” he replied.	325.28662077771196
 Chapter 111. Expiation	493.01219684767796
Notwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open	474.187567246138
before him. There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions	361.22381668572984
that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally	312.0737432217102
been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe. Many	436.5607476367778
people have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have	307.69833085703686
rarely been insulted during trial. Thus Villefort passed through the	425.2388786956251
mass of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew. Though he	480.6496960464052
had acknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief. There are	302.73674503052365
some situations which men understand by instinct, but which reason is	495.50704827508724
powerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives	454.20369164514915
utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow. Those	352.25234042863866
who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an	460.67847664090266
entire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in	422.9394867378029
regarding his outburst as sublime.	469.3976746899832
It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which	403.5601826681761
Villefort left the Palais. Every pulse beat with feverish excitement,	451.42595206196916
every nerve was strained, every vein swollen, and every part of his	452.903272007543
body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest, thus multiplying his	370.20088966555477
agony a thousand-fold. He made his way along the corridors through	424.6731305519346
force of habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of	420.8996201922423
deference to etiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a	362.56064827201993
veritable garb of Nessus, insatiate in torture. Having staggered as far	311.6694313835547
as the Rue Dauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping	352.65396185333935
coachman by opening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions,	428.77325764013443
and pointed towards the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; the carriage drove on.	368.8644852592827
All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he	345.12098024910324
could not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future	402.0215894409042
with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a	436.63806522551965
contingency already familiar.	413.1466488241771
God was still in his heart. “God,” he murmured, not knowing what he	372.9634101739157
said,—“God—God!” Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the	469.29360782801916
hand of God. The carriage rolled rapidly onward. Villefort, while	406.69670711915967
turning restlessly on the cushions, felt something press against him.	448.3658034693034
He put out his hand to remove the object; it was a fan which Madame de	454.1700725265671
Villefort had left in the carriage; this fan awakened a recollection	327.4375427529288
which darted through his mind like lightning. He thought of his wife.	342.3950798060823
50189m	433.31173543352406
“Oh!” he exclaimed, as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart.	332.99367395093816
During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his	351.14520715163667
mind; now another object, not less terrible, suddenly presented itself.	348.8457447691375
His wife! He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had	352.7667357598004
condemned her to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with	410.56003401468104
terror, covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of _his_	391.7000691267495
irreproachable virtue,—she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the	363.41139481378474
power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will,—she	341.710100129576
might at that very moment, perhaps, be preparing to die!	472.9681787348752
An hour had elapsed since her condemnation; at that moment, doubtless,	402.4057978556667
she was recalling all her crimes to her memory; she was asking pardon	378.7675217203598
for her sins; perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring	456.8737983790204
forgiveness from her virtuous husband—a forgiveness she was purchasing	389.57202772161924
with her death! Villefort again groaned with anguish and despair.	461.2804944102445
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “that woman became criminal only from associating	404.7115543678779
with me! I carried the infection of crime with me, and she has caught	441.0006771794823
it as she would the typhus fever, the cholera, the plague! And yet I	366.8308544295104
have punished her—I have dared to tell her—_I_ have—‘Repent and die!’	462.5425393109109
But no, she must not die; she shall live, and with me. We will flee	302.19183673372277
from Paris and go as far as the earth reaches. I told her of the	472.47820272552224
scaffold; oh, Heavens, I forgot that it awaits me also! How could I	303.03560263026424
pronounce that word? Yes, we will fly; I will confess all to her,—I	433.69242298116245
will tell her daily that I also have committed a crime!—Oh, what an	466.5517425738704
alliance—the tiger and the serpent; worthy wife of such as I am! She	392.65623153625074
_must_ live that my infamy may diminish hers.”	313.097171428403
And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage.	493.8361743066673
“Faster, faster!” he cried, in a tone which electrified the coachman.	357.4908769917616
The horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.	477.14284531623593
“Yes, yes,” repeated Villefort, as he approached his home—“yes, that	454.96474615146985
woman must live; she must repent, and educate my son, the sole	364.15006264500767
survivor, with the exception of the indestructible old man, of the	414.7562391899124
wreck of my house. She loves him; it was for his sake she has committed	434.30217730275143
these crimes. We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a	439.4231643632537
mother who loves her child. She will repent, and no one will know that	308.37995315245826
she has been guilty. The events which have taken place in my house,	383.17596904233704
though they now occupy the public mind, will be forgotten in time, or	337.74912802697315
if, indeed, a few enemies should persist in remembering them, why then	392.4546860314212
I will add them to my list of crimes. What will it signify if one, two,	484.85517874645666
or three more are added? My wife and child shall escape from this gulf,	448.39045702772523
carrying treasures with them; she will live and may yet be happy, since	375.11214668395746
her child, in whom all her love is centred, will be with her. I shall	306.12948817489576
have performed a good action, and my heart will be lighter.”	312.7838419424803
And the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time.	362.371063691412
50191m	344.656612068637
The carriage stopped at the door of the house. Villefort leaped out of	342.32331590087904
the carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early	448.81195264189154
return; he could read no other expression on their features. Neither of	396.21610848578007
them spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by, as	300.6179867661775
usual, nothing more. As he passed by M. Noirtier’s room, he perceived	380.44474311207046
two figures through the half-open door; but he experienced no curiosity	422.1726560603344
to know who was visiting his father; anxiety carried him on further.	458.71836930065047
“Come,” he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife’s room,	360.0285305682392
“nothing is changed here.”	445.8951259042699
He then closed the door of the landing.	330.07462268606025
“No one must disturb us,” he said; “I must speak freely to her, accuse	377.8107211246371
myself, and say”—he approached the door, touched the crystal handle,	374.1299238309234
which yielded to his hand. “Not locked,” he cried; “that is well.”	304.25553970660064
And he entered the little room in which Edward slept; for though the	340.7769422680614
child went to school during the day, his mother could not allow him to	390.43976805762765
be separated from her at night. With a single glance Villefort’s eye	426.0745272571256
ran through the room.	477.4232427745588
“Not here,” he said; “doubtless she is in her bedroom.” He rushed	478.3686137304087
towards the door, found it bolted, and stopped, shuddering.	330.1454481444081
“Héloïse!” he cried. He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of	485.8345850704194
furniture being removed.	422.4845804416244
“Héloïse!” he repeated.	460.31659285694195
“Who is there?” answered the voice of her he sought. He thought that	393.8945570309477
voice more feeble than usual.	374.64800478985
“Open the door!” cried Villefort. “Open; it is I.”	469.01222639385924
But notwithstanding this request, notwithstanding the tone of anguish	350.1473647891528
in which it was uttered, the door remained closed. Villefort burst it	477.1024422558894
open with a violent blow. At the entrance of the room which led to her	422.14848497284885
boudoir, Madame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features	376.72635987358666
contracted, and her eyes glaring horribly.	490.3332957303093
“Héloïse, Héloïse!” he said, “what is the matter? Speak!” The young	413.5546377444391
woman extended her stiff white hands towards him.	471.3127537370344
“It is done, monsieur,” she said with a rattling noise which seemed to	419.0781036951569
tear her throat. “What more do you want?” and she fell full length on	325.8979640360452
the floor.	313.98457030622797
Villefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively clasped a	316.46033279397074
crystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was dead.	393.8282678084367
Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold of the	360.3016587849828
door, fixing his eyes on the corpse.	340.5014097121329
“My son!” he exclaimed suddenly, “where is my son?—Edward, Edward!” and	378.86130135493954
he rushed out of the room, still crying, “Edward, Edward!” The name was	310.595239089474
pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up.	366.7519941042195
“Where is my son?” asked Villefort; “let him be removed from the house,	404.3054941708567
that he may not see——”	380.0428992047656
“Master Edward is not downstairs, sir,” replied the valet.	421.33251971335085
“Then he must be playing in the garden; go and see.”	492.3093394842777
50193m	490.4837281654708
“No, sir; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went	474.06084256705765
into her room, and has not been downstairs since.”	312.62659491326355
A cold perspiration burst out on Villefort’s brow; his legs trembled,	356.7070461084237
and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a	438.8380673886272
disordered watch.	373.794062257719
“In Madame de Villefort’s room?” he murmured and slowly returned, with	322.7198066632854
one hand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself	489.5436326023794
against the wall. To enter the room he must again see the body of his	429.02578209531225
unfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room	425.06665230202094
which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the	453.5004753480181
silence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.	331.03814570836585
“Edward!” he stammered—“Edward!”	329.42307612548336
The child did not answer. Where, then, could he be, if he had entered	446.4828725192684
his mother’s room and not since returned? He stepped forward. The	444.99337902802574
corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading	315.4492495451781
to the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch	495.009940942752
over the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and	468.6559979767451
mysterious irony. Through the open door was visible a portion of the	486.686258834525
boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch. Villefort	473.7013362319915
stepped forward two or three paces, and beheld his child lying—no doubt	438.9020174658831
asleep—on the sofa. The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy; a	360.47011044132904
ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness. He	337.96210741539903
had only to step over the corpse, enter the boudoir, take the child in	320.51231158430346
his arms, and flee far, far away.	469.4232581878417
Villefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto	354.4461738846627
death, gnashing his teeth in his wound. He no longer feared realities,	478.38459391008
but phantoms. He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning	306.89723200958946
brazier. He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called	483.3858079050972
him, but the child made no response. He pressed his burning lips to the	448.0425054102396
cheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs;	438.54728184764144
he pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,—the child	406.9798525095305
was dead.	307.21865648395544
A folded paper fell from Edward’s breast. Villefort, thunderstruck,	312.60440137620157
fell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and rolled on the	403.4886632522679
floor by the side of its mother. He picked up the paper, and,	392.6230463726218
recognizing his wife’s writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its contents;	303.76862156071655
it ran as follows:	452.6899371094042
“You know that I was a good mother, since it was for my son’s sake I	453.2604994935996
became criminal. A good mother cannot depart without her son.”	410.11145194563454
Villefort could not believe his eyes,—he could not believe his reason;	315.45593540439216
he dragged himself towards the child’s body, and examined it as a	368.4732391838
lioness contemplates its dead cub. Then a piercing cry escaped from his	454.0359164529427
breast, and he cried,	333.52847393578594
“Still the hand of God.”	349.345578889134
The presence of the two victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude	368.9021292615619
shared only by two corpses. Until then he had been sustained by rage,	431.55907499357784
by his strength of mind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the	469.64528143594816
Titans to scale the heavens, and Ajax to defy the gods. He now arose,	299.52131931231094
his head bowed beneath the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp,	478.94867737458117
dishevelled hair, he who had never felt compassion for anyone	340.2617800662084
determined to seek his father, that he might have someone to whom he	450.2637240757472
could relate his misfortunes,—someone by whose side he might weep.	426.1769064829776
50195m	343.12619425681686
He descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted, and	474.71335673799996
entered Noirtier’s room. The old man appeared to be listening	480.7121561693075
attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the	450.73120258988956
Abbé Busoni, who looked cold and calm, as usual. Villefort, perceiving	350.38589210860306
the abbé, passed his hand across his brow. The past came to him like	486.0894267794165
one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others.	352.86695592044106
He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at	395.38408532066
Auteuil, and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on	328.2725592653387
the day of Valentine’s death.	488.7136147996515
“You here, sir!” he exclaimed; “do you, then, never appear but to act	407.66693003653614
as an escort to death?”	381.259614361504
Busoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the	449.9443738421482
magistrate’s face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that	423.18615204450106
the revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was	315.1712278085762
ignorant.	375.74983507138757
“I came to pray over the body of your daughter.”	304.56242848199497
“And now why are you here?”	378.8752320725821
“I come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt, and	424.17585049211095
that from this moment I will pray to God to forgive you, as I do.”	434.51858270897844
“Good heavens!” exclaimed Villefort, stepping back fearfully, “surely	377.47205235300976
that is not the voice of the Abbé Busoni!”	340.01881994278665
“No!” The abbé threw off his wig, shook his head, and his hair, no	486.294027072768
longer confined, fell in black masses around his manly face.	412.71768411589983
“It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo!” exclaimed the procureur,	322.4162018229495
with a haggard expression.	498.27108010661664
“You are not exactly right, M. Procureur; you must go farther back.”	339.07113077792985
“That voice, that voice!—where did I first hear it?”	409.7718913482673
“You heard it for the first time at Marseilles, twenty-three years ago,	395.1825062963267
the day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran. Refer to	345.7647275804188
your papers.”	396.09149379708265
“You are not Busoni?—you are not Monte Cristo? Oh, heavens! you are,	444.25920503396856
then, some secret, implacable, and mortal enemy! I must have wronged	379.22492274277386
you in some way at Marseilles. Oh, woe to me!”	376.16114826578325
“Yes; you are now on the right path,” said the count, crossing his arms	310.5802076207903
over his broad chest; “search—search!”	397.12309775820967
“But what have I done to you?” exclaimed Villefort, whose mind was	332.3449985455749
balancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a	316.89956287334394
dream nor reality; “what have I done to you? Tell me, then! Speak!”	366.52638548859534
“You condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father;	484.9547091504951
you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.”	391.40603559844163
“Who are you, then? Who are you?”	417.9189134159715
“I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the Château	344.2228521686743
d’If. God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when	458.8811877901142
he at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds,	455.599516918297
and led him to you!”	461.0404177845502
“Ah, I recognize you—I recognize you!” exclaimed the king’s attorney;	362.54719144882546
“you are——”	376.14694070024797
“I am Edmond Dantès!”	309.33449212017666
“You are Edmond Dantès,” cried Villefort, seizing the count by the	441.872489313728
wrist; “then come here!”	484.8228926021808
And up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo; who, ignorant of what had	320.1850060202496
happened, followed him in astonishment, foreseeing some new	352.02875361450197
catastrophe.	325.37823001458327
“There, Edmond Dantès!” he said, pointing to the bodies of his wife and	443.0629596482279
child, “see, are you well avenged?”	392.9972220828083
Monte Cristo became pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had	469.40491860002703
passed beyond the bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say,	454.74956886024927
“God is for and with me.” With an expression of indescribable anguish	339.5856941624493
he threw himself upon the body of the child, reopened its eyes, felt	405.4612289067679
its pulse, and then rushed with him into Valentine’s room, of which he	426.2307145148734
double-locked the door.	466.43531195462066
“My child,” cried Villefort, “he carries away the body of my child! Oh,	310.7850490601384
curses, woe, death to you!”	358.34183540192885
He tried to follow Monte Cristo; but as though in a dream he was	307.5852946251258
transfixed to the spot,—his eyes glared as though they were starting	372.5620487707223
through the sockets; he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails	491.8349180939043
were stained with blood; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as	373.085993138796
though they would burst their narrow boundary, and deluge his brain	473.8149575406148
with living fire. This lasted several minutes, until the frightful	432.9699233363948
overturn of reason was accomplished; then uttering a loud cry followed	471.9270994411886
by a burst of laughter, he rushed down the stairs.	394.160569854586
A quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentine’s room opened,	354.8468734848011
and Monte Cristo reappeared. Pale, with a dull eye and heavy heart, all	305.38187763540515
the noble features of that face, usually so calm and serene, were	333.37410012690214
overcast by grief. In his arms he held the child, whom no skill had	331.69737262158685
been able to recall to life. Bending on one knee, he placed it	327.9505213867629
reverently by the side of its mother, with its head upon her breast.	313.61617125143545
Then, rising, he went out, and meeting a servant on the stairs, he	438.9422842588288
asked:	497.5207463323162
“Where is M. de Villefort?”	343.67873421442243
The servant, instead of answering, pointed to the garden. Monte Cristo	466.5918227153377
ran down the steps, and advancing towards the spot designated beheld	433.7954887611195
Villefort, encircled by his servants, with a spade in his hand, and	446.59397815105297
digging the earth with fury.	321.06884216951516
“It is not here!” he cried. “It is not here!”	330.1486296885112
50197m	439.740614326126
And then he moved farther on, and began again to dig.	313.7961767078293
Monte Cristo approached him, and said in a low voice, with an	310.77635938797505
expression almost humble:	324.8328815460951
“Sir, you have indeed lost a son; but——”	305.87020200688266
Villefort interrupted him; he had neither listened nor heard.	377.9937323570167
“Oh, I _will_ find it,” he cried; “you may pretend he is not here, but	355.0809499564383
I _will_ find him, though I dig forever!”	316.21334758120486
Monte Cristo drew back in horror.	492.2082342860124
“Oh,” he said, “he is mad!” And as though he feared that the walls of	436.7401520176979
the accursed house would crumble around him, he rushed into the street,	442.2064668578829
for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had	492.89629920329594
done. “Oh, enough of this,—enough of this,” he cried; “let me save the	469.8340429162188
last.” On entering his house, he met Morrel, who wandered about like a	492.01209821763405
ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb.	379.28641053980465
“Prepare yourself, Maximilian,” he said with a smile; “we leave Paris	391.1316155707088
tomorrow.”	330.8454437002029
“Have you nothing more to do there?” asked Morrel.	402.55702851099875
“No,” replied Monte Cristo; “God grant I may not have done too much	401.4632880706883
already.”	322.77897211221045
The next day they indeed left, accompanied only by Baptistin. Haydée	370.7795487941373
had taken away Ali, and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier.	362.7780865483942
 Chapter 112. The Departure	359.8390893557887
The recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all	384.6099588744062
Paris. Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in	324.47295008642556
their little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive,	393.0830932760207
sudden, and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf, Danglars, and	417.6005714147782
Villefort. Maximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their	486.772784659683
conversation, or rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed	430.8319298124094
state of apathy.	430.35802093430107
“Indeed,” said Julie, “might we not almost fancy, Emmanuel, that those	498.09569897471005
people, so rich, so happy but yesterday, had forgotten in their	300.9293882584226
prosperity that an evil genius—like the wicked fairies in Perrault’s	460.8427723120734
stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism—hovered	471.91860761588
over them, and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal	346.0472755596859
neglect?”	456.1698289604887
“What a dire misfortune!” said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and	459.65328351168364
Danglars.	376.8847752413387
“What dreadful sufferings!” said Julie, remembering Valentine, but	469.89787873065666
whom, with a delicacy natural to women, she did not name before her	453.5399429839445
brother.	360.93930632701654
“If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow,” said Emmanuel, “it	326.6494180044795
must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past	410.82756587829635
lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment.”	353.56876466202687
“Do you not form a very rash judgment, Emmanuel?” said Julie. “When my	335.657359538901
father, with a pistol in his hand, was once on the point of committing	458.0377800946959
suicide, had anyone then said, ‘This man deserves his misery,’ would	404.99908078377746
not that person have been deceived?”	388.10418553653506
“Yes; but your father was not allowed to fall. A being was commissioned	413.79258011398696
to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him.”	459.955961819633
Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell	329.6946363780937
was heard, the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had	479.72059394122857
arrived. Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count	456.360217033814
of Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold. The young people uttered a	384.85361469646847
cry of joy, while Maximilian raised his head, but let it fall again	389.0070429575628
immediately.	421.08527880271896
50201m	313.79705708685293
“Maximilian,” said the count, without appearing to notice the different	350.5677956780594
impressions which his presence produced on the little circle, “I come	407.42233307806663
to seek you.”	394.6996735199223
“To seek me?” repeated Morrel, as if awakening from a dream.	346.79220189188686
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “has it not been agreed that I should take	394.6729098091877
you with me, and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for	494.25735936238607
departure?”	399.9880023989863
“I am ready,” said Maximilian; “I came expressly to wish them	307.0146578993984
farewell.”	479.1016838290152
“Whither are you going, count?” asked Julie.	327.00792679967276
“In the first instance to Marseilles, madame.”	328.35313240253146
“To Marseilles!” exclaimed the young couple.	315.91282769580346
“Yes, and I take your brother with me.”	458.96701274215343
“Oh, count.” said Julie, “will you restore him to us cured of his	301.28029350658977
melancholy?” Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his	462.1092483263912
countenance.	416.6861076212776
“You perceive, then, that he is not happy?” said the count.	423.6301041566753
“Yes,” replied the young woman; “and fear much that he finds our home	498.1254907244915
but a dull one.”	397.2941523091325
“I will undertake to divert him,” replied the count.	449.6716604573621
“I am ready to accompany you, sir,” said Maximilian. “Adieu, my kind	395.1021371332553
friends! Emmanuel—Julie—farewell!”	364.9723402085562
“How farewell?” exclaimed Julie; “do you leave us thus, so suddenly,	482.9630428582627
without any preparations for your journey, without even a passport?”	403.2000831402114
“Needless delays but increase the grief of parting,” said Monte Cristo,	314.75404241612387
“and Maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything	406.5533111504091
requisite; at least, I advised him to do so.”	363.03982429531857
“I have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed,” said Morrel in	396.50088182947457
his tranquil but mournful manner.	451.9341048044762
“Good,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “in these prompt arrangements we	300.2185171078528
recognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier.”	337.56005167212453
“And you leave us,” said Julie, “at a moment’s warning? you do not give	438.4622373978258
us a day—no, not even an hour before your departure?”	459.07256502519556
“My carriage is at the door, madame, and I must be in Rome in five	405.43616567306896
days.”	424.27652332793923
“But does Maximilian go to Rome?” exclaimed Emmanuel.	434.2632154238014
“I am going wherever it may please the count to take me,” said Morrel,	378.1947994945784
with a smile full of grief; “I am under his orders for the next month.”	353.94732360193836
“Oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!” said Julie.	340.9574929072512
“Maximilian goes with _me_,” said the count, in his kindest and most	376.1143336648569
persuasive manner; “therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your	324.77638418631835
brother’s account.”	351.6387354890663
“Once more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!” Morrel repeated.	328.76842645059514
“His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,” said Julie.	416.09727181718586
“Oh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are certainly concealing something	300.26313469397
from us.”	398.28942099638937
“Pshaw!” said Monte Cristo, “you will see him return to you gay,	302.42228838124606
smiling, and joyful.”	410.49628328461216
Maximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.	313.9626315419581
“We must leave you,” said Monte Cristo.	394.48744368941607
50203m	494.3511399466304
“Before you quit us, count,” said Julie, “will you permit us to express	403.3790106945057
to you all that the other day——”	471.9839384850659
“Madame,” interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, “all that	378.7244329689173
you could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes;	476.7134373693383
the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine. Like	378.2832793537326
benefactors in romances, I should have left you without seeing you	366.8247063907557
again, but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength, because I	411.39713976147596
am a weak and vain man, fond of the tender, kind, and thankful glances	473.06897790221626
of my fellow-creatures. On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so	460.92634382793193
far as to say, ‘Do not forget me, my kind friends, for probably you	427.83407437051403
will never see me again.’”	339.5684586598447
“Never see you again?” exclaimed Emmanuel, while two large tears rolled	310.0131000007927
down Julie’s cheeks, “never behold you again? It is not a man, then,	395.50070170950335
but some angel that leaves us, and this angel is on the point of	373.8075063680782
returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good.”	330.64285485817385
“Say not so,” quickly returned Monte Cristo—“say not so, my friends;	339.3067960519976
angels never err, celestial beings remain where they wish to be. Fate	486.3709268409737
is not more powerful than they; it is they who, on the contrary,	336.3834061336141
overcome fate. No, Emmanuel, I am but a man, and your admiration is as	313.42251513514776
unmerited as your words are sacrilegious.”	455.73075849403324
And pressing his lips on the hand of Julie, who rushed into his arms,	343.804020065298
he extended his other hand to Emmanuel; then tearing himself from this	395.8656631557036
abode of peace and happiness, he made a sign to Maximilian, who	432.45919195416366
followed him passively, with the indifference which had been	465.39839777745703
perceptible in him ever since the death of Valentine had so stunned	303.02186480060385
him.	433.9441981085172
“Restore my brother to peace and happiness,” whispered Julie to Monte	307.86527757864167
Cristo. And the count pressed her hand in reply, as he had done eleven	381.47316481506596
years before on the staircase leading to Morrel’s study.	391.29079794195644
“You still confide, then, in Sinbad the Sailor?” asked he, smiling.	409.5346564864838
“Oh, yes,” was the ready answer.	488.958539107368
“Well, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in the Lord.”	460.2134481768239
As we have before said, the post-chaise was waiting; four powerful	449.6366639779792
horses were already pawing the ground with impatience, while Ali,	430.79689526900756
apparently just arrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of	454.35904933447
the steps, his face bathed in perspiration.	459.9395639360272
“Well,” asked the count in Arabic, “have you been to see the old man?”	376.594919902431
Ali made a sign in the affirmative.	493.63745720777183
“And have you placed the letter before him, as I ordered you to do?”	402.9852934205483
The slave respectfully signalized that he had.	313.9833238233699
“And what did he say, or rather do?” Ali placed himself in the light,	473.7930796891285
so that his master might see him distinctly, and then imitating in his	405.8399612991959
intelligent manner the countenance of the old man, he closed his eyes,	368.60229812419027
as Noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying “Yes.”	302.1478565390053
“Good; he accepts,” said Monte Cristo. “Now let us go.”	350.3116207209921
50205m	427.6991145126203
These words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,	374.68971961072225
and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.	407.83204385927297
Maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word. Half	454.77321880451075
an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had	312.95978875215235
just pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to Ali’s	477.07002721541744
finger. The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door.	357.14737478772213
It was a lovely starlight night—they had just reached the top of the	409.088786177889
hill Villejuif, from whence Paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its	390.59437904630136
millions of phosphoric waves into light—waves indeed more noisy, more	332.6982487717034
passionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those of	341.6740151771053
the tempestuous ocean,—waves which never rest as those of the sea	468.69706049559056
sometimes do,—waves ever dashing, ever foaming, ever ingulfing what	382.45878254536797
falls within their grasp.	390.2114593161832
The count stood alone, and at a sign from his hand, the carriage went	461.0602163248167
on for a short distance. With folded arms, he gazed for some time upon	445.5946522815451
the great city. When he had fixed his piercing look on this modern	451.7290067640372
Babylon, which equally engages the contemplation of the religious	408.93493540464544
enthusiast, the materialist, and the scoffer,—	490.01817680208796
“Great city,” murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as	493.99997072988896
if in prayer, “less than six months have elapsed since first I entered	487.59460970118533
thy gates. I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and	330.9123746065494
that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my	465.05338580370164
presence within thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had	477.6648212966609
the power to read my heart. God only knows that I retire from thee	371.6649668574303
without pride or hatred, but not without many regrets; he only knows	397.32269215883423
that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my	369.5910179565511
personal good or to any useless cause. Oh, great city, it is in thy	438.4953577439091
palpitating bosom that I have found that which I sought; like a patient	365.62624554527923
miner, I have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence.	447.9239721999297
Now my work is accomplished, my mission is terminated, now thou canst	358.39055159360174
neither afford me pain nor pleasure. Adieu, Paris, adieu!”	420.26072079198514
His look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the	325.21465736747876
night; he passed his hand over his brow, got into the carriage, the	334.21651551912834
door was closed on him, and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the	319.17736099891385
other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise.	452.3099729252883
Ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered. Morrel was	405.07221557932905
dreaming, and Monte Cristo was looking at the dreamer.	416.5933843927811
“Morrel,” said the count to him at length, “do you repent having	413.2782475019059
followed me?”	404.28016968692214
“No, count; but to leave Paris——”	475.52647715334535
“If I thought happiness might await you in Paris, Morrel, I would have	461.0913414611591
left you there.”	483.3366787101579
“Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris, and to leave Paris is	448.97654122864446
like losing her a second time.”	411.99714301269364
“Maximilian,” said the count, “the friends that we have lost do not	448.50937021441314
repose in the bosom of the earth, but are buried deep in our hearts,	444.38995103187466
and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by	488.21019208255177
them. I have two friends, who in this way never depart from me; the one	429.44408750697767
who gave me being, and the other who conferred knowledge and	448.76437712287384
intelligence on me. Their spirits live in me. I consult them when	356.2460549438039
doubtful, and if I ever do any good, it is due to their beneficent	401.55325274811366
counsels. Listen to the voice of your heart, Morrel, and ask it whether	435.6588084454733
you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me.”	335.5006247196933
“My friend,” said Maximilian, “the voice of my heart is very sorrowful,	450.54323017210845
and promises me nothing but misfortune.”	419.0566748380739
“It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black	461.9547493864078
cloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and	440.8787503642336
consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising.”	342.5072701371676
“That may possibly be true,” said Maximilian, and he again subsided	358.9686167125298
into his thoughtful mood.	397.55288225955167
The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the	352.48782489899884
unlimited power of the count ever commanded. Towns fled from them like	420.0303752294875
shadows on their path, and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn	479.64231862439067
seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them, and retreating as	492.7697588749253
rapidly when once reached. The following morning they arrived at	369.12828660581226
Châlons, where the count’s steamboat waited for them. Without the loss	335.04147385369043
of an instant, the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers	380.7307658329644
embarked without delay. The boat was built for speed; her two	428.74214181560393
paddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like	473.34506469638967
a bird.	387.8022953935407
Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is	340.1388325296382
generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind	433.406392150109
which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the	381.35516286209037
point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there.	407.2119023431888
As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost	485.4366658672245
superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been	347.81111661203255
taken for an exile about to revisit his native land.	395.564300368788
Ere long Marseilles presented herself to view,—Marseilles, white,	323.9864837443971
fervid, full of life and energy,—Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre	474.85461449962247
and Carthage, the successor to them in the empire of the	409.8993579772956
Mediterranean,—Marseilles, old, yet always young. Powerful memories	391.19631454184713
were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower, Fort	306.0092919901402
Saint-Nicolas, the City Hall designed by Puget,28 the port with its	434.21480058787154
brick quays, where they had both played in childhood, and it was with	461.189174937923
one accord that they stopped on the Canebière.	386.9980818153339
A vessel was setting sail for Algiers, on board of which the bustle	489.23328647690823
usually attending departure prevailed. The passengers and their	409.61633016376845
relations crowded on the deck, friends taking a tender but sorrowful	419.5559007844232
leave of each other, some weeping, others noisy in their grief, the	492.4973214080544
whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who	484.8026544048838
witnessed similar sights daily, but which had no power to disturb the	432.21856418662253
current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of Maximilian	425.21089581834156
from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay.	311.0044843581898
“Here,” said he, leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo,—“here is	489.3616394861806
the spot where my father stopped, when the _Pharaon_ entered the port;	350.7053782472071
it was here that the good old man, whom you saved from death and	329.75710508288984
dishonor, threw himself into my arms. I yet feel his warm tears on my	326.56211840402676
face, and his were not the only tears shed, for many who witnessed our	411.7597736181092
meeting wept also.”	437.7204434269362
Monte Cristo gently smiled and said,—“I was there;” at the same time	307.84797765848657
pointing to the corner of a street. As he spoke, and in the very	442.46579889385544
direction he indicated, a groan, expressive of bitter grief, was heard,	397.1552086052704
and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel	451.9908896469426
about to sail. Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must	302.324449201363
have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel.	330.06992699597
“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed Morrel, “I do not deceive myself—that young	476.91890518386117
man who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant,	452.42366042654453
is Albert de Morcerf!”	321.36152348385525
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I recognized him.”	377.72451215704336
“How so?—you were looking the other way.”	470.98672419399475
50209m	437.36120635363216
The count smiled, as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want	423.97997523795095
to make any reply, and he again turned towards the veiled woman, who	432.63915436277387
soon disappeared at the corner of the street. Turning to his friend:	301.21495158919106
“Dear Maximilian,” said the count, “have you nothing to do in this	477.08076764768714
land?”	457.8452302664092
“I have to weep over the grave of my father,” replied Morrel in a	439.9710402092967
broken voice.	433.20031999231753
“Well, then, go,—wait for me there, and I will soon join you.”	404.9858063288055
“You leave me, then?”	464.30873329721686
“Yes; I also have a pious visit to pay.”	482.0356791526274
Morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to	434.8588912151299
him; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he	421.13098054505974
quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city. Monte	428.17711528354334
Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight; he	312.85393132666246
then walked slowly towards the Allées de Meilhan to seek out a small	351.24256133174714
house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of	450.59207235702604
this story.	430.143634093521
It yet stood, under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees, which	424.00590478318077
forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of Marseilles,	309.6867898595717
covered by an immense vine, which spreads its aged and blackened	456.1832742830162
branches over the stone front, burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the	305.86949862584856
south. Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to	482.0525394841537
the door, which was made of three planks; the door had never been	487.5811473077809
painted or varnished, so great cracks yawned in it during the dry	355.1397507082204
season to close again when the rains came on. The house, with all its	383.33988313637076
crumbling antiquity and apparent misery, was yet cheerful and	447.7146129306773
picturesque, and was the same that old Dantès formerly inhabited—the	346.20662131193137
only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret,	464.3394307790054
while the whole house was now placed at the command of Mercédès by the	387.90503703263977
count.	342.2414161285101
The woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret	329.45612947663636
entered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when	414.43824781334854
Monte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street, so that he found and	310.370146046296
lost her again almost at the same instant. The worn out steps were old	331.32550061792534
acquaintances of his; he knew better than anyone else how to open that	326.5017754204216
weather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise	454.4947394014206
the latch within. He entered without knocking, or giving any other	437.28006645012624
intimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master of	327.1019518965985
the place. At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little	496.98407070646954
garden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light. In this	317.5699159229406
garden Mercédès had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum	344.5056045537896
of money which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having	414.05704740618364
been placed there twenty-four years previously. The trees of the garden	485.5253638652324
were easily seen from the steps of the street-door.	352.61551936767074
Monte Cristo, on stepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost	495.96698598363974
a deep sob; he looked in the direction whence it came, and there under	488.5348966603294
an arbor of Virginia jessamine,29 with its thick foliage and beautiful	428.2990176395565
long purple flowers, he saw Mercédès seated, with her head bowed, and	458.84649431695266
weeping bitterly. She had raised her veil, and with her face hidden by	464.1723358954855
her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been	448.2981937033585
so long restrained by the presence of her son.	334.35743568276024
Monte Cristo advanced a few steps, which were heard on the gravel.	397.59789005167136
Mercédès raised her head, and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a	440.36568258363593
man before her.	435.9580112835617
50211m	483.6508365341765
“Madame,” said the count, “it is no longer in my power to restore you	470.8867348156772
to happiness, but I offer you consolation; will you deign to accept it	386.6163156869106
as coming from a friend?”	345.6866056632341
“I am, indeed, most wretched,” replied Mercédès. “Alone in the world, I	431.7486025275995
had but my son, and he has left me!”	365.487362937372
“He possesses a noble heart, madame,” replied the count, “and he has	449.7623799472361
acted rightly. He feels that every man owes a tribute to his country;	479.5325716265861
some contribute their talents, others their industry; these devote	490.1871400781092
their blood, those their nightly labors, to the same cause. Had he	397.90679409152295
remained with you, his life must have become a hateful burden, nor	343.7776199113851
would he have participated in your griefs. He will increase in strength	426.5932340423208
and honor by struggling with adversity, which he will convert into	354.65228139644546
prosperity. Leave him to build up the future for you, and I venture to	403.9472094861573
say you will confide it to safe hands.”	343.8079035398675
“Oh,” replied the wretched woman, mournfully shaking her head, “the	395.14593876673445
prosperity of which you speak, and which, from the bottom of my heart,	493.239679482203
I pray God in his mercy to grant him, I can never enjoy. The bitter cup	347.52028686574397
of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs, and I feel that	363.2879575731549
the grave is not far distant. You have acted kindly, count, in bringing	376.37788231065497
me back to the place where I have enjoyed so much bliss. I ought to	445.2591942733542
meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own.”	360.7074848884594
“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “your words sear and embitter my heart, the	438.3566370385375
more so as you have every reason to hate me. I have been the cause of	386.6744238005514
all your misfortunes; but why do you pity, instead of blaming me? You	465.53693476790744
render me still more unhappy——”	496.23018168981014
“Hate you, blame you—_you_, Edmond! Hate, reproach, the man that has	410.35167249690784
spared my son’s life! For was it not your fatal and sanguinary	411.70153508537715
intention to destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud? Oh,	496.00158516484964
look at me closely, and discover, if you can, even the semblance of a	355.8872642212829
reproach in me.”	331.50679870439706
The count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercédès, who arose partly	472.5793801900936
from her seat and extended both her hands towards him.	322.50632939926356
“Oh, look at me,” continued she, with a feeling of profound melancholy,	457.7049573090131
“my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy, for the time has long	401.90749698097704
fled since I used to smile on Edmond Dantès, who anxiously looked out	311.77681219563897
for me from the window of yonder garret, then inhabited by his old	413.1498627246001
father. Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the	467.6452735380677
present. I neither reproach you nor hate you, my friend. Oh, no,	458.10022088676465
Edmond, it is myself that I blame, myself that I hate! Oh, miserable	403.1939942147587
creature that I am!” cried she, clasping her hands, and raising her	426.36992197251993
eyes to heaven. “I once possessed piety, innocence, and love, the three	437.33151795975243
ingredients of the happiness of angels, and now what am I?”	467.47022001055325
Monte Cristo approached her, and silently took her hand.	431.8286442334611
“No,” said she, withdrawing it gently—“no, my friend, touch me not. You	450.557528956164
have spared me, yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance I	431.7908549370575
was the most guilty. They were influenced by hatred, by avarice, and by	484.0603790315796
self-love; but I was base, and for want of courage acted against my	422.22521537780426
judgment. Nay, do not press my hand, Edmond; you are thinking, I am	411.12675968436326
sure, of some kind speech to console me, but do not utter it to me,	308.37327330001096
reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness. See” (and she	457.43456505169496
exposed her face completely to view)—“see, misfortune has silvered my	412.6561645104337
hair, my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim	437.36435466209537
of purple, and my brow is wrinkled. You, Edmond, on the contrary,—you	407.3175375256816
are still young, handsome, dignified; it is because you have had faith;	344.72101202470276
because you have had strength, because you have had trust in God, and	307.36390376924163
God has sustained you. But as for me, I have been a coward; I have	345.8792812345908
denied God and he has abandoned me.”	307.4083381014534
50213m	308.2695723940613
Mercédès burst into tears; her woman’s heart was breaking under its	377.170117902697
load of memories. Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on	304.0853543904502
it; but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than	310.6905887327629
he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint.	318.4072208618318
“It often happens,” continued she, “that a first fault destroys the	419.0024808249328
prospects of a whole life. I believed you dead; why did I survive you?	347.59737136197515
What good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret	494.9716694190316
recesses of my heart?—only to make a woman of thirty-nine look like a	462.1244515464153
woman of fifty. Why, having recognized you, and I the only one to do	496.09354424822243
so—why was I able to save my son alone? Ought I not also to have	445.7921345702267
rescued the man that I had accepted for a husband, guilty though he	473.6454425930499
were? Yet I let him die! What do I say? Oh, merciful heavens, was I not	319.00883566074447
accessory to his death by my supine insensibility, by my contempt for	396.5087116946663
him, not remembering, or not willing to remember, that it was for my	312.3404346310683
sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer? In what am I benefited by	461.67710458588846
accompanying my son so far, since I now abandon him, and allow him to	450.65822477864697
depart alone to the baneful climate of Africa? Oh, I have been base,	479.4874813676456
cowardly, I tell you; I have abjured my affections, and like all	413.01540519018624
renegades I am of evil omen to those who surround me!”	442.39265952465905
“No, Mercédès,” said Monte Cristo, “no; you judge yourself with too	428.4279407731053
much severity. You are a noble-minded woman, and it was your grief that	477.6382093023825
disarmed me. Still I was but an agent, led on by an invisible and	431.33379123184636
offended Deity, who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was	388.55693568877683
destined to hurl. I take that God to witness, at whose feet I have	398.12264441032994
prostrated myself daily for the last ten years, that I would have	381.10994764194686
sacrificed my life to you, and with my life the projects that were	333.2010709393608
indissolubly linked with it. But—and I say it with some pride,	384.5210325097945
Mercédès—God needed me, and I lived. Examine the past and the present,	444.38363839858266
and endeavor to dive into futurity, and then say whether I am not a	404.64605739782985
divine instrument. The most dreadful misfortunes, the most frightful	353.70926555316316
sufferings, the abandonment of all those who loved me, the persecution	491.4166832103826
of those who did not know me, formed the trials of my youth; when	337.85954704887365
suddenly, from captivity, solitude, misery, I was restored to light and	381.8197881736074
liberty, and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant, so	429.9627489582607
unbounded, so unheard-of, that I must have been blind not to be	381.8618871065951
conscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great	326.29030959995623
designs. From that time I looked upon this fortune as something	420.8615731871692
confided to me for a particular purpose. Not a thought was given to a	301.1613812355876
life which you once, Mercédès, had the power to render blissful; not	442.5737462409587
one hour of peaceful calm was mine; but I felt myself driven on like an	332.4392916643789
exterminating angel. Like adventurous captains about to embark on some	399.1181345650041
enterprise full of danger, I laid in my provisions, I loaded my	491.7636365080604
weapons, I collected every means of attack and defence; I inured my	448.13937373704294
body to the most violent exercises, my soul to the bitterest trials; I	299.07039491349843
taught my arm to slay, my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings, and	489.0500387558666
my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles. Good-natured,	399.51731758987347
confiding, and forgiving as I had been, I became revengeful, cunning,	415.7098029509255
and wicked, or rather, immovable as fate. Then I launched out into the	399.93166542807205
path that was opened to me. I overcame every obstacle, and reached the	437.2515714145414
goal; but woe to those who stood in my pathway!”	480.3518420272816
50215m	364.2462240713745
“Enough,” said Mercédès; “enough, Edmond! Believe me, that she who	345.4123937230852
alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you; and had	460.31157491345084
she crossed your path, and you had crushed her like glass, still,	408.31392286489546
Edmond, still she must have admired you! Like the gulf between me and	454.6755449632793
the past, there is an abyss between you, Edmond, and the rest of	368.1698422517242
mankind; and I tell you freely that the comparison I draw between you	336.4239982639783
and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures. No, there is	476.81081266609334
nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness! But we must	400.613067560652
say farewell, Edmond, and let us part.”	316.4972568492756
“Before I leave you, Mercédès, have you no request to make?” said the	451.58651083811355
count.	484.4063306674591
“I desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,—the happiness of my	431.0131074898257
son.”	352.0820339172625
“Pray to the Almighty to spare his life, and I will take upon myself to	314.54318093665154
promote his happiness.”	489.71663602639114
“Thank you, Edmond.”	346.2076371035105
“But have you no request to make for yourself, Mercédès?”	423.91204442571825
“For myself I want nothing. I live, as it were, between two graves. One	377.8290534111441
is that of Edmond Dantès, lost to me long, long since. He had my love!	312.07808338667735
That word ill becomes my faded lip now, but it is a memory dear to my	419.0776829611535
heart, and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains.	453.4359841210156
The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of	330.6930588120223
Edmond Dantès. I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead.”	475.1260035916205
“Your son shall be happy, Mercédès,” repeated the count.	392.06654378938833
“Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly	482.3685799945096
confer.”	370.3659979531725
“But what are your intentions?”	417.9037514025285
Mercédès smiled sadly.	325.71146827942914
“To say that I shall live here, like the Mercédès of other times,	477.3103638772845
gaining my bread by labor, would not be true, nor would you believe me.	361.10741088581534
I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in	405.56609318530786
prayer. However, I shall have no occasion to work, for the little sum	330.1431176883728
of money buried by you, and which I found in the place you mentioned,	325.6179136591013
will be sufficient to maintain me. Rumor will probably be busy	467.1003093754192
respecting me, my occupations, my manner of living—that will signify	469.39348699589806
but little, that concerns God, you, and myself.”	358.4075681165147
“Mercédès,” said the count, “I do not say it to blame you, but you made	357.08479126858856
an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune	465.74649499637223
amassed by M. de Morcerf; half of it at least by right belonged to you,	493.9305082543543
in virtue of your vigilance and economy.”	349.4749667880799
“I perceive what you are intending to propose to me; but I cannot	311.1912463221516
accept it, Edmond—my son would not permit it.”	333.9232655692607
“Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de	495.14326514220227
Morcerf. I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will	398.1766942063008
submit to them. But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you	436.067023977826
oppose them?”	322.0659799765182
“You well know, Edmond, that I am no longer a reasoning creature; I	422.525873622881
have no will, unless it be the will never to decide. I have been so	414.65276367038473
overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head, that I am	367.5078392279875
become passive in the hands of the Almighty, like a sparrow in the	466.0781988643095
talons of an eagle. I live, because it is not ordained for me to die.	307.2569968665285
If succor be sent to me, I will accept it.”	332.7796815714212
“Ah, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “you should not talk thus! It is not	315.0750402562034
so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven; on the	385.24912677419167
contrary, we are all free agents.”	430.6137385118151
“Alas!” exclaimed Mercédès, “if it were so, if I possessed free-will,	350.4619984151365
but without the power to render that will efficacious, it would drive	312.37670095722274
me to despair.”	436.6614952758721
Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her	410.8846034893733
grief.	305.6795232800539
“Will you not even say you will see me again?” he asked.	470.54213121083905
“On the contrary, we shall meet again,” said Mercédès, pointing to	423.2199179495539
heaven with solemnity. “I tell you so to prove to you that I still	492.9136648560211
hope.”	455.22893646133787
And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count,	364.5615947515853
Mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left	403.6504944063703
the house and turned towards the quay. But Mercédès did not witness his	433.46534328204547
departure, although she was seated at the little window of the room	364.1911564071579
which had been occupied by old Dantès. Her eyes were straining to see	408.52574811667444
the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her	381.5032666745745
voice involuntarily murmured softly:	401.17344560248216
“Edmond, Edmond, Edmond!”	415.05876220134496
 Chapter 113. The Past	327.76175222136715
The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left	373.8041822163445
Mercédès, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little	370.0841461127556
Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached	478.213949667626
the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an	356.64649092741604
abyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation	336.6185226928889
which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so	409.4025121255898
many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat	355.95804193593904
with them. A man of the count’s temperament could not long indulge in	393.11608038044074
that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys	444.0160460739402
superior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his	416.19505456907285
calculations if he now found cause to blame himself.	370.3494179093239
“I cannot have deceived myself,” he said; “I must look upon the past in	443.38987612827674
a false light. What!” he continued, “can I have been following a false	392.5417271831002
path?—can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?—can one hour have	383.4876282913992
sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded	322.0320765984557
all his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious, undertaking? I	320.8544926260267
cannot reconcile myself to this idea—it would madden me. The reason why	357.4992733676288
I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the	405.2713302923273
past. The past, like the country through which we walk, becomes	459.6426693371309
indistinct as we advance. My position is like that of a person wounded	449.1607758701793
in a dream; he feels the wound, though he cannot recollect when he	319.7460101317789
received it.	340.6205554829142
“Come, then, thou regenerate man, thou extravagant prodigal, thou	498.45217796640736
awakened sleeper, thou all-powerful visionary, thou invincible	407.4270885631804
millionaire,—once again review thy past life of starvation and	460.8442879543345
wretchedness, revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted,	327.4137871617765
and where despair received thee. Too many diamonds, too much gold and	328.1976455778086
splendor, are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks	416.25885076229133
to behold Dantès. Hide thy diamonds, bury thy gold, shroud thy	447.4133842419013
splendor, exchange riches for poverty, liberty for a prison, a living	326.38241364501823
body for a corpse!”	487.89787724540184
As he thus reasoned, Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caisserie.	376.20106025096806
It was the same through which, twenty-four years ago, he had been	361.4944350751172
conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard; the houses, today so smiling	412.79560672393444
and animated, were on that night dark, mute, and closed.	473.83947164142796
“And yet they were the same,” murmured Monte Cristo, “only now it is	494.28756186164435
broad daylight instead of night; it is the sun which brightens the	325.6120317706716
place, and makes it appear so cheerful.”	395.7104790468885
He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to	460.6948024672535
the Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked. A pleasure-boat	454.28670711853766
with striped awning was going by. Monte Cristo called the owner, who	305.98908919741353
immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for	446.5354138003173
a good fare.	368.71591557338206
The weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat. The sun, red	304.6109741258651
and flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean. The	330.9751540331984
sea, smooth as crystal, was now and then disturbed by the leaping of	488.62385264345806
fish, which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in	395.69941661389544
another element; while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be	311.6709539913892
seen the fishermen’s boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull, or the	371.8834704246459
merchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain.	411.42149029127313
But notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and	403.42066785821083
the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of	334.494862626355
Monte Cristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible	471.73811345895905
voyage, the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory.	307.9316494561897
The solitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the	436.34345827931196
Château d’If, which told him whither they were leading him; the	422.43441436155376
struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard;	465.23938462602393
his despair when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when	425.1839003689464
the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead—all these were brought	320.1645380948038
before him in vivid and frightful reality.	321.03766182506064
Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up, and which	369.8559737033871
after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop, so did	329.6262929932977
the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which	311.289776619113
formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès. Clear sky, swift-flitting	342.99085363332694
boats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the heavens were hung with	433.016498039211
black, and the gigantic structure of the Château d’If seemed like the	432.13526470919993
phantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the shore, the count	299.86437406154806
instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat, and the owner was	443.8001109984916
obliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice:	429.5552461497895
“Sir, we are at the landing.”	339.053507948884
Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he	403.8967270850731
had been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the	491.2814925390958
slope at the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long	454.0428254164631
to Dantès, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the	357.68791878880415
oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the	343.1596629669092
flying spray of the sea.	446.45964228865887
50219m	362.70571381301664
There had been no prisoners confined in the Château d’If since the	315.92469579842935
revolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for	402.2946678848863
the prevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit	324.5770314636743
to visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror.	374.1618650773389
The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there;	322.6568234812976
but they had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other	303.8262400836275
employment. The concierge who attended him had only been there since	358.21686145200323
1830. He visited his own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly	302.7093263087908
endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the	469.88161657175795
spot where had stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed	477.3681089664353
the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had	462.5696856120246
been. Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log	403.4011385615406
of wood.	439.58769204707795
“Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one	497.12951740213543
relating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?” asked the count; “are there any	367.6745669491429
traditions respecting these dismal abodes,—in which it is difficult to	425.03434742496114
believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?”	405.0451242279689
“Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this	489.6963034849232
very dungeon.”	447.12598111952684
Monte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost	487.0859238048302
forgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled	348.43693036582704
his person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing	325.6183792256988
the brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still	316.71820918962095
seemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the	370.02302764737965
corridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.	320.2559788391308
“Would you like to hear the story, sir?”	319.2720375384627
“Yes; relate it,” said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to	460.32471601927267
still its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.	308.40345321760424
“This dungeon,” said the concierge, “was, it appears, some time ago	414.16427976462995
occupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of	482.119839529764
industry. Another person was confined in the Château at the same time,	349.19741025858525
but he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest.”	486.7276944576637
“Ah, indeed?—mad!” repeated Monte Cristo; “and what was his mania?”	453.0681935996281
“He offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty.”	353.54544137128124
Monte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there	413.5520668660783
was a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there	362.76792493122565
had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria	419.1731424052328
offered the treasures.	355.4817102721378
“Could the prisoners see each other?” he asked.	355.3046099889617
“Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance	468.95581400142873
of the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.”	353.4059772592101
“And which of them made this passage?”	460.19838489117114
“Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and	435.8684083692674
industrious, while the abbé was aged and weak; besides, his mind was	311.5405895735098
too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea.”	370.00974904458656
“Blind fools!” murmured the count.	426.19253110622185
“However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by	475.0195094246135
what means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet	329.4732517935246
remaining of his work. Do you see it?” and the man held the torch to	308.7193349978208
the wall.	331.0049347492412
50223m	454.9954503347524
“Ah, yes; I see,” said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.	406.3696176281575
“The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how	333.32272532987986
long they did so, nobody knows. One day the old man fell ill and died.	395.51568435841943
Now guess what the young one did?”	477.8360476319829
“Tell me.”	306.7408149514968
“He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its	341.3853131428799
face to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the	311.3745638840468
entrance, and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body.	363.4545682762121
Did you ever hear of such an idea?”	469.1461462472792
Monte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again to experience all the	380.6626003966975
sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas, yet moist with the cold	393.43216369117135
dews of death, had touched his face.	331.96495839100356
The jailer continued:	381.60125190723846
“Now this was his project. He fancied that they buried the dead at the	467.1671251583111
Château d’If, and imagining they would not expend much labor on the	350.7435971385624
grave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with his	373.1774571506593
shoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Château	318.5886069793383
frustrated his projects. They never buried the dead; they merely	480.6926657944803
attached a heavy cannon-ball to the feet, and then threw them into the	432.3753294944812
sea. This is what was done. The young man was thrown from the top of	451.8374215713595
the rock; the corpse was found on the bed next day, and the whole truth	398.46108841886826
was guessed, for the men who performed the office then mentioned what	323.5143921310061
they had not dared to speak of before, that at the moment the corpse	425.17681766135036
was thrown into the deep, they heard a shriek, which was almost	350.11425677068615
immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared.”	301.4145267090413
The count breathed with difficulty; the cold drops ran down his	312.32730473219254
forehead, and his heart was full of anguish.	301.99624183008666
“No,” he muttered, “the doubt I felt was but the commencement of	336.86436697228174
forgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts	412.3390126519379
for vengeance. And the prisoner,” he continued aloud, “was he ever	474.5368400788822
heard of afterwards?”	402.42250315133117
“Oh, no; of course not. You can understand that one of two things must	370.9732544841819
have happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow,	357.4414775427532
from a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he	450.7505021911649
must have fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to	315.0149112576634
the bottom, where he remained—poor fellow!”	388.0963517135081
“Then you pity him?” said the count.	462.1917955167934
“_Ma foi_, yes; though he was in his own element.”	408.709773997529
“What do you mean?”	391.5603674637404
“The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined	475.20157152315494
for plotting with the Bonapartists.”	426.47394437414704
“Great is truth,” muttered the count, “fire cannot burn, nor water	315.88366229633414
drown it! Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who	446.0205670244633
narrate his history; his terrible story is recited in the	439.970908183421
chimney-corner, and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit	310.6188811571295
through the air to be swallowed by the deep.” Then, the count added	465.1200202238581
aloud, “Was his name ever known?”	389.3239819192581
“Oh, yes; but only as No. 34.”	365.5741075731744
“Oh, Villefort, Villefort,” murmured the count, “this scene must often	399.64807938794604
have haunted thy sleepless hours!”	399.78433918996063
“Do you wish to see anything more, sir?” said the concierge.	401.0755618717883
“Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbé’s room.”	433.27314825136665
“Ah! No. 27.”	415.4925597743115
“Yes; No. 27.” repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the	467.37950635532394
abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his	316.58828666277947
name.	321.3064559980599
“Come, sir.”	484.18284029181484
“Wait,” said Monte Cristo, “I wish to take one final glance around this	424.76539536451475
room.”	378.73103470493635
“This is fortunate,” said the guide; “I have forgotten the other key.”	459.27117391386145
“Go and fetch it.”	345.42481978285366
“I will leave you the torch, sir.”	336.86792691154
“No, take it away; I can see in the dark.”	343.322353704751
“Why, you are like No. 34. They said he was so accustomed to darkness	338.1918001934033
that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon.”	310.17175514324583
“He spent fourteen years to arrive at that,” muttered the count.	467.1427414448021
The guide carried away the torch. The count had spoken correctly.	379.48902495578346
Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed, ere he saw everything as distinctly	375.03363040604927
as by daylight. Then he looked around him, and really recognized his	373.52103448799016
dungeon.	443.6986511104722
“Yes,” he said, “there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is	438.0591787005029
the impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of	358.404509777451
my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall. Oh, those	361.5938930631977
figures, how well I remember them! I made them one day to calculate the	445.86236486461655
age of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still	435.7211384346297
living, and that of Mercédès, to know if I should find her still free.	327.96675188917465
After finishing that calculation, I had a minute’s hope. I did not	481.28375448469177
reckon upon hunger and infidelity!” and a bitter laugh escaped the	332.81568204676967
count.	377.0791747962187
He saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of Mercédès.	313.64559135787755
On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription, the white	464.03135722752455
letters of which were still visible on the green wall:	347.97591795650095
“‘_Oh, God!_’” he read, “‘_preserve my memory!_’”	455.1210671526253
“Oh, yes,” he cried, “that was my only prayer at last; I no longer	318.8343533777685
begged for liberty, but memory; I dreaded to become mad and forgetful.	303.932691950307
Oh, God, thou hast preserved my memory; I thank thee, I thank thee!”	375.4782079722711
At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall; the	343.62942631298984
guide was coming; Monte Cristo went to meet him.	352.6967711668566
“Follow me, sir;” and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted	394.54949426511337
him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance. There, again, Monte	473.1115954493168
Cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts. The first thing that	493.9693881115556
met his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbé on the wall, by which	410.17827035211053
he calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the	351.40358036477903
poor prisoner had died. The sight of this, instead of exciting the	461.23671399080956
anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with	427.22298939221656
a soft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.	434.3632610220933
“This is where the mad abbé was kept, sir, and that is where the young	300.2917319591939
man entered;” and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained	350.79546849794554
unclosed. “From the appearance of the stone,” he continued, “a learned	386.66963899427776
gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated	324.77379201589054
together for ten years. Poor things! Those must have been ten weary	363.633001242752
years.”	392.07794399612203
Dantès took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who	359.9521767003563
had twice unconsciously pitied him. The guide took them, thinking them	383.30726279335346
merely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch	356.9310911642621
revealed their true worth.	451.84458986038885
“Sir,” he said, “you have made a mistake; you have given me gold.”	408.563935632955
“I know it.”	416.89359073835374
The concierge looked upon the count with surprise.	390.45344184962414
“Sir,” he cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune—“sir, I	446.91689954265496
cannot understand your generosity!”	384.57467493684624
“Oh, it is very simple, my good fellow; I have been a sailor, and your	401.681360264182
story touched me more than it would others.”	468.8714518035197
“Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something.”	355.0072917535058
50227m	468.42006923277836
“What have you to offer to me, my friend? Shells? Straw-work? Thank	386.93241579918964
you!”	299.71228707266664
“No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.”	338.43991264257824
“Really? What is it?”	417.56773508121523
“Listen,” said the guide; “I said to myself, ‘Something is always left	406.5419156157073
in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years,’ so I began to	308.9533457181727
sound the wall.”	395.9347001237438
“Ah,” cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbé’s two hiding-places.	444.8620778185973
“After some search, I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the	401.8480702879934
head of the bed, and at the hearth.”	411.8794396241188
“Yes,” said the count, “yes.”	373.72482907791675
“I raised the stones, and found——”	316.38491909337387
“A rope-ladder and some tools?”	317.93641318255254
“How do you know that?” asked the guide in astonishment.	416.6488152698457
“I do not know—I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally	485.553814900064
found in prisoners’ cells.”	498.905180933363
“Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.”	425.2296959960215
“And have you them yet?”	362.98990489956884
“No, sir; I sold them to visitors, who considered them great	359.98400420218053
curiosities; but I have still something left.”	309.7573444550158
“What is it?” asked the count, impatiently.	305.96712350748777
“A sort of book, written upon strips of cloth.”	383.1877226968457
“Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do	488.4476043002313
well.”	326.02886452428737
“I will run for it, sir;” and the guide went out.	422.3892384661083
Then the count knelt down by the side of the bed, which death had	319.576257497899
converted into an altar.	345.0550214395398
“Oh, second father,” he exclaimed, “thou who hast given me liberty,	402.8123650389962
knowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to	395.133618641882
ourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the	342.7172656854731
depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can	379.7236488498098
respond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the	325.2131471505073
soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,—then,	398.50540302053673
noble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love	465.1988241446236
thou didst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me	468.99245677581666
some sign, some revelation! Remove from me the remains of doubt, which,	406.8539145825917
if it change not to conviction, must become remorse!” The count bowed	459.37186414900657
his head, and clasped his hands together.	354.2515796575056
“Here, sir,” said a voice behind him.	328.95962271179195
Monte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of	389.31575465550134
cloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The	386.9851592592979
manuscript was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the kingdoms of	449.3814301708891
Italy. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the	373.47626748695075
epigraph, and he read:	428.07513721843486
“Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions	466.9470121929936
under foot, saith the Lord.”	489.81763672696604
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “here is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks.” And	437.5473451945305
feeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which	467.544279104413
contained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000 francs.	393.85992482182553
“Here,” he said, “take this pocket-book.”	450.58758607599873
“Do you give it to me?”	483.7364395923141
“Yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;”	457.599732675711
and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was	480.33721243608807
more valuable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the	394.3626034628539
corridor, and reaching his boat, cried, “To Marseilles!”	475.93851959753226
Then, as he departed, he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison.	337.84304369468566
“Woe,” he cried, “to those who confined me in that wretched prison; and	454.9697381792471
woe to those who forgot that I was there!”	468.0429399461866
50229m	406.8887385837057
As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and burying his	444.2927968938268
head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman. The victory was	460.83079045937563
complete; twice he had overcome his doubts. The name he pronounced, in	398.1131248353262
a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love, was that of Haydée.	386.0393910522296
On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure	461.93234536491616
of finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a	418.9134903088343
tomb, and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions,	432.0361200098858
had been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from	469.18027066251955
hunger. Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had	423.61975213734996
fallen down and the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old	306.6231457561584
wood in the churchyard.	357.08072874140487
The worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the arms of his	434.73426797657635
children, he had been by them laid by the side of his wife, who had	339.05852195250895
preceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of marble, on	440.1367202977225
which were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a	407.7852867532024
little enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees. Morrel	361.057214265919
was leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes on the	321.6554453111298
graves. His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.	485.32418384889195
50231m	334.42987226647136
“Maximilian,” said the count, “you should not look on the graves, but	431.2908755723411
there;” and he pointed upwards.	306.7208610137507
“The dead are everywhere,” said Morrel; “did you not yourself tell me	391.6901017019735
so as we left Paris?”	365.97761477839896
“Maximilian,” said the count, “you asked me during the journey to allow	433.86710776554696
you to remain some days at Marseilles. Do you still wish to do so?”	420.53030929963245
“I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less	437.32864097982014
painfully here than anywhere else.”	446.0237430583798
“So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with	491.7982171717987
me, do I not?”	368.28809522704535
“Ah, count, I shall forget it.”	409.421284731977
“No, you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor, Morrel,	437.3515756954197
because you have taken an oath, and are about to do so again.”	327.8868048247277
“Oh, count, have pity upon me. I am so unhappy.”	374.56643591752754
“I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel.”	458.76295864079185
“Impossible!”	482.2340052395635
“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “it is the infirmity of our nature always to	486.60883964729334
believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!”	326.5947712811971
“What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and	373.73020108364744
desired in the world?”	388.1591261603319
“Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I	434.0270316776042
knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a	463.9159516773734
woman. He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed	334.3011305172456
bride whom he adored. He was about to marry her, when one of the	317.9658682008759
caprices of fate,—which would almost make us doubt the goodness of	309.49743311472616
Providence, if that Providence did not afterwards reveal itself by	449.2550218075569
proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end,—one of those	397.5499525681177
caprices deprived him of his mistress, of the future of which he had	383.3255426415528
dreamed (for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the	459.96521676985697
present), and cast him into a dungeon.”	409.47758906367426
“Ah,” said Morrel, “one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.”	440.2928750415261
“He remained there fourteen years, Morrel,” said the count, placing his	371.72306388598895
hand on the young man’s shoulder. Maximilian shuddered.	430.5554792293408
“Fourteen years!” he muttered.	403.1053035536265
“Fourteen years!” repeated the count. “During that time he had many	406.40009521724454
moments of despair. He also, Morrel, like you, considered himself the	496.1873108413954
unhappiest of men.”	419.8945657176059
“Well?” asked Morrel.	372.22870405659404
“Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human	447.50057727334786
means. At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of	440.6665773662571
the Lord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he	394.65458730359353
miraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first	369.0755224883037
cry was for his father; but that father was dead.”	315.22482280236585
“My father, too, is dead,” said Morrel.	381.50980583155626
“Yes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and	320.78300119013267
full of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of	480.45275695811654
Providence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his	367.9193038160807
tomb had disappeared, and no one could say, ‘There sleeps the father	394.8375263070858
you so well loved.’”	345.4039237177656
“Oh!” exclaimed Morrel.	380.74574641224194
“He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not	498.9184515618088
even find his father’s grave.”	331.7926218140009
“But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?”	371.6636822335711
“You are deceived, Morrel, that woman——”	401.7436045100411
“She was dead?”	302.84329462373216
“Worse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the	478.8905798295556
persecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more	301.46955981826545
unhappy lover than you.”	416.81588228433486
“And has he found consolation?”	424.39806875485846
“He has at least found peace.”	307.90535006132774
“And does he ever expect to be happy?”	407.6954685450289
“He hopes so, Maximilian.”	326.6304144355093
The young man’s head fell on his breast.	309.7110292272496
“You have my promise,” he said, after a minute’s pause, extending his	414.5365769098104
hand to Monte Cristo. “Only remember——”	470.7955414013403
“On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of	354.5639785219165
Monte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of	382.65772915655685
Bastia, it will be called the _Eurus_. You will give your name to the	405.05229034391226
captain, who will bring you to me. It is understood—is it not?”	458.4277521842179
“But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October——”	424.1110443073807
“Child,” replied the count, “not to know the value of a man’s word! I	427.5695176302198
have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day, I will	336.51281172285337
assist you. Morrel, farewell!”	497.1858720906714
“Do you leave me?”	467.3820472032778
“Yes; I have business in Italy. I leave you alone in your struggle with	448.071971571031
misfortune—alone with that strong-winged eagle which God sends to bear	432.77257844872844
aloft the elect to his feet. The story of Ganymede, Maximilian, is not	424.19414937085315
a fable, but an allegory.”	432.6494086828819
“When do you leave?”	458.05018408656775
“Immediately; the steamer waits, and in an hour I shall be far from	498.38674284844967
you. Will you accompany me to the harbor, Maximilian?”	416.63419249069034
50233m	312.4791900904934
“I am entirely yours, count.”	484.9319402192708
Morrel accompanied the count to the harbor. The white steam was	402.1722190008615
ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney. The steamer	457.97653820612567
soon disappeared, and in an hour afterwards, as the count had said, was	411.6168663842605
scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night.	451.7416590575329
 Chapter 114. Peppino	408.8748017705111
At the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgiou, a	358.8203945941377
man travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed	308.35567077238096
the little town of Aquapendente. He was travelling fast enough to cover	372.22685546996115
a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion. This man was dressed	354.8060438147938
in a greatcoat, or rather a surtout, a little worse for the journey,	301.4621907717629
but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and	394.0142344468127
brilliant, a decoration which also ornamented the under coat. He might	439.07346431207066
be recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with	369.7526646481799
which he spoke to the postilion, as a Frenchman.	492.93348586198965
Another proof that he was a native of the universal country was	470.7506597285851
apparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the	458.27015808190845
terms used in music, and which like the “goddam” of Figaro, served all	320.0557889573358
possible linguistic requirements. “_Allegro!_” he called out to the	445.16437368471804
postilions at every ascent. “_Moderato!_” he cried as they descended.	311.91070159504216
And heaven knows there are hills enough between Rome and Florence by	384.4175381857823
the way of Aquapendente! These two words greatly amused the men to whom	326.3930937040087
they were addressed. On reaching La Storta, the point from whence Rome	364.773675155802
is first visible, the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic	477.36317502692845
curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to	431.34416398841984
catch sight of the dome of Saint Peter’s, which may be seen long before	309.26626764237153
any other object is distinguishable. No, he merely drew a pocketbook	406.52100950946914
from his pocket, and took from it a paper folded in four, and after	405.6975357177205
having examined it in a manner almost reverential, he said:	403.9670284429155
“Good! I have it still!”	385.87072648432957
50235m	461.2530951551578
The carriage entered by the Porta del Popolo, turned to the left, and	357.0390097725919
stopped at the Hôtel d’Espagne. Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance,	428.88410187654836
received the traveller at the door, hat in hand. The traveller	432.1532272922068
alighted, ordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house	438.87544715325157
of Thomson & French, which was immediately given to him, as it was one	304.7080296674417
of the most celebrated in Rome. It was situated in the Via dei Banchi,	464.8314368125168
near St. Peter’s.	314.0280644975743
In Rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an event.	315.7703281787972
Ten young descendants of Marius and the Gracchi, barefooted and out at	384.4303669169239
elbows, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully	303.1419868669473
curved above the head, stared at the traveller, the post-chaise, and	365.4002509513358
the horses; to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the	490.6701830346136
Papal States, who earned a pittance by diving into the Tiber at high	400.1371241931552
water from the bridge of St. Angelo. Now, as these street Arabs of	405.30909374621035
Rome, more fortunate than those of Paris, understand every language,	330.5155351617518
more especially the French, they heard the traveller order an	490.59079194261665
apartment, a dinner, and finally inquire the way to the house of	431.02584194932217
Thomson & French.	352.6907619514137
The result was that when the new-comer left the hotel with the	458.34283295254
_cicerone_, a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers, and	371.79747259350256
without having been seen by the traveller, and appearing to excite no	497.61868656050694
attention from the guide, followed the stranger with as much skill as a	398.1016758023384
Parisian police agent would have used.	405.48862386527696
The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson &	389.0643654008219
French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed, but left	325.65825573596845
word for the carriage to overtake him on the road, or to wait for him	462.68704562322125
at the bankers’ door. He reached it before the carriage arrived. The	421.2687008969428
Frenchman entered, leaving in the anteroom his guide, who immediately	441.99361156665674
entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers	369.837386171154
who are always to be found in Rome at the doors of banking-houses,	416.4515083317277
churches, museums, or theatres. With the Frenchman, the man who had	475.17832295554194
followed him entered too; the Frenchman knocked at the inner door, and	395.27334646802205
entered the first room; his shadow did the same.	491.81336355075143
“Messrs. Thomson & French?” inquired the stranger.	488.80013279449804
An attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first	374.13772992016425
desk.	429.024560813292
“Whom shall I announce?” said the attendant.	448.4422277459346
“Baron Danglars.”	359.6206364315439
“Follow me,” said the man.	369.1572230375525
A door opened, through which the attendant and the baron disappeared.	378.5377200151732
The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a bench. The clerk	365.6955994598513
continued to write for the next five minutes; the man preserved	348.3923296915854
profound silence, and remained perfectly motionless. Then the pen of	415.5192343230532
the clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head, and	311.40171410813014
appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy:	419.5646585689565
“Ah, ha,” he said, “here you are, Peppino!”	333.86928709209377
“Yes,” was the laconic reply. “You have found out that there is	445.149482786886
something worth having about this large gentleman?”	439.99756383546026
“There is no great merit due to me, for we were informed of it.”	423.76950908718584
“You know his business here, then.”	458.37330622938777
“_Pardieu_, he has come to draw, but I don’t know how much!”	438.8374198105484
“You will know presently, my friend.”	478.4008936655023
“Very well, only do not give me false information as you did the other	444.96260640795964
day.”	382.44842036078245
“What do you mean?—of whom do you speak? Was it the Englishman who	485.9323441883068
carried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?”	355.58034471867603
50237m	363.3143998007963
“No; he really had 3,000 crowns, and we found them. I mean the Russian	307.5076612816525
prince, who you said had 30,000 livres, and we only found 22,000.”	309.91778031244775
“You must have searched badly.”	378.38096014741416
“Luigi Vampa himself searched.”	403.0558991557865
“In that case he must either have paid his debts——”	318.2209483546355
“A Russian do that?”	361.96021477854424
“Or spent the money?”	449.04405864096543
“Possibly, after all.”	457.7027676033037
“Certainly. But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman	450.79765478997007
will transact his business without my knowing the sum.”	440.5952158931283
Peppino nodded, and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a	480.9985010206432
few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which	299.0111723303331
Danglars and the attendant had gone out. At the expiration of ten	326.89077425485283
minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance.	345.3052341026291
“Well?” asked Peppino of his friend.	446.819434376653
“Joy, joy—the sum is large!”	419.1522879296738
“Five or six millions, is it not?”	403.9945115786819
“Yes, you know the amount.”	345.74718509364493
“On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo?”	477.19279381618384
“Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?”	430.3875563501243
“I told you we were informed beforehand.”	370.37047816007475
“Then why do you apply to me?”	365.5175520227481
“That I may be sure I have the right man.”	498.55690985184424
“Yes, it is indeed he. Five millions—a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?”	436.3334304470908
“Hush—here is our man!” The clerk seized his pen, and Peppino his	445.37001050546075
beads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened.	312.34191060454725
Danglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the	401.0910730938714
door. Peppino followed Danglars.	406.7865000263893
According to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door.	462.3574191449337
The guide held the door open. Guides are useful people, who will turn	321.95262895384803
their hands to anything. Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young	437.7149901304257
man of twenty. The _cicerone_ reclosed the door, and sprang up by the	493.7346412380583
side of the coachman. Peppino mounted the seat behind.	358.1837085966539
“Will your excellency visit Saint Peter’s?” asked the _cicerone_.	427.62926007256794
“I did not come to Rome to see,” said Danglars aloud; then he added	423.3783788063675
softly, with an avaricious smile, “I came to touch!” and he rapped his	370.33044395953675
pocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter.	323.95760340248967
“Then your excellency is going——”	369.85496776062246
“To the hotel.”	449.18012198572126
“Casa Pastrini!” said the _cicerone_ to the coachman, and the carriage	324.6860168991689
drove rapidly on.	493.46141050526205
50239m	351.73890766967986
Ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment, and Peppino	491.2591594995596
stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel, after	482.41844957469186
having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of	342.35876705475204
Marius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter,	412.1338812540597
who immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol at his fullest	398.21572232392833
speed. Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went to bed, placing	343.99179219111636
his pocketbook under his pillow. Peppino had a little spare time, so he	326.37427302504653
had a game of _morra_ with the facchini, lost three crowns, and then to	467.6081793178657
console himself drank a bottle of Orvieto.	300.65498009115873
The next morning Danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early;	445.9517330112925
he had not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at	410.439332502806
all. He breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the	330.76755733438745
beauties of the Eternal City, ordered post-horses at noon. But Danglars	330.1757508944531
had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of	307.47352430383523
the posting-master. The horses only arrived at two o’clock, and the	399.163442777643
_cicerone_ did not bring the passport till three.	396.66057589891955
All these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door	316.8431157613362
of Signor Pastrini’s; the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were	445.3319493475203
also not wanting. The baron walked triumphantly through the crowd, who	401.6341857251541
for the sake of gain styled him “your excellency.” As Danglars had	358.28666246750385
hitherto contented himself with being called a baron, he felt rather	303.1621405130907
flattered at the title of excellency, and distributed a dozen silver	440.8157824631606
coins among the beggars, who were ready, for twelve more, to call him	425.2692775520326
“your highness.”	339.6933201011785
“Which road?” asked the postilion in Italian.	423.9628782234239
“The Ancona road,” replied the baron. Signor Pastrini interpreted the	438.6526629611675
question and answer, and the horses galloped off.	312.0670338841063
Danglars intended travelling to Venice, where he would receive one part	483.0772247592031
of his fortune, and then proceeding to Vienna, where he would find the	337.7199818016976
rest, he meant to take up his residence in the latter town, which he	496.1405962283729
had been told was a city of pleasure.	338.23335873335736
He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began	367.33826098054385
to disappear. Danglars had not intended starting so late, or he would	328.7284134104217
have remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it	453.3683219977173
would be before they reached the next town. “_Non capisco_” (do not	330.6894911427201
understand), was the reply. Danglars bent his head, which he meant to	416.0995008339753
imply, “Very well.” The carriage again moved on.	325.739562980806
“I will stop at the first posting-house,” said Danglars to himself.	472.367874233444
He still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the	349.337917089911
previous evening, and which had procured him so good a night’s rest. He	412.0938204599592
was luxuriously stretched in a good English calash, with double	300.6980572167246
springs; he was drawn by four good horses, at full gallop; he knew the	382.4656556567228
relay to be at a distance of seven leagues. What subject of meditation	475.7452685907658
could present itself to the banker, so fortunately become bankrupt?	491.46085926064006
Danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in Paris; another ten	452.2698748635072
minutes about his daughter travelling with Mademoiselle d’Armilly; the	475.38313138256996
same period was given to his creditors, and the manner in which he	456.1962450889555
intended spending their money; and then, having no subject left for	386.135674597388
contemplation, he shut his eyes, and fell asleep. Now and then a jolt	370.6817916855444
more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt	361.1406149691838
that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same	408.02038232165825
country, thickly strewn with broken aqueducts, which looked like	336.52262792965377
granite giants petrified while running a race. But the night was cold,	361.60133910804757
dull, and rainy, and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to	478.30108583474754
remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to	469.91074858124153
make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was “_Non capisco_.”	498.80493488454636
50241m	397.6065757235972
Danglars therefore continued to sleep, saying to himself that he would	460.718285545392
be sure to awake at the posting-house. The carriage stopped. Danglars	409.3515767904938
fancied that they had reached the long-desired point; he opened his	484.44219326710675
eyes and looked through the window, expecting to find himself in the	407.26558429227913
midst of some town, or at least village; but he saw nothing except what	357.23207136585063
seemed like a ruin, where three or four men went and came like shadows.	383.12870344946515
Danglars waited a moment, expecting the postilion to come and demand	421.977173566846
payment with the termination of his stage. He intended taking advantage	412.52725027173597
of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but	432.3463191051594
the horses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without	420.9322538389023
anyone claiming money from the traveller. Danglars, astonished, opened	394.34150898590633
the door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled	372.1670046748825
on. The baron was completely roused.	322.00352307783294
“Eh?” he said to the postilion, “eh, _mio caro?_”	318.35948828687555
This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from	384.9661867824391
hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalcanti. But _mio caro_	405.6076072021092
did not reply. Danglars then opened the window.	389.08206561871975
“Come, my friend,” he said, thrusting his hand through the opening,	377.2712368901503
“where are we going?”	447.76136341422784
“_Dentro la testa!_” answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied	411.4035833968079
by a menacing gesture.	453.90141267101944
Danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant, “Put in your head!” He was	487.41340230060035
making rapid progress in Italian. He obeyed, not without some	428.7312351817518
uneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead of	469.92453704666207
being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with	448.17539191099786
ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially	369.3466723978227
one in such a situation as Danglars. His eyes acquired that quality	408.5167010014728
which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see	441.1046412511014
distinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed.	416.7349513724896
Before we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see	340.66981872676547
double; and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble.	437.0512219827676
Danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the	444.96776244236617
carriage.	403.01337946385723
“Some gendarme!” he exclaimed. “Can I have been intercepted by French	373.37772343780534
telegrams to the pontifical authorities?”	457.6981915048918
He resolved to end his anxiety. “Where are you taking me?” he asked.	451.3102385136873
“_Dentro la testa_,” replied the same voice, with the same menacing	337.69033942358766
accent.	375.74903422920227
Danglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping on	377.0213201723129
that side.	459.5353726688537
“Decidedly,” said Danglars, with the perspiration on his forehead, “I	394.05217409524175
must be under arrest.” And he threw himself back in the calash, not	460.4299106697279
this time to sleep, but to think.	315.89482137059156
Directly afterwards the moon rose. He then saw the great aqueducts,	326.4509076176394
those stone phantoms which he had before remarked, only then they were	412.8209661440542
on the right hand, now they were on the left. He understood that they	446.75058290497174
had described a circle, and were bringing him back to Rome.	307.432374503051
“Oh, unfortunate!” he cried, “they must have obtained my arrest.”	449.3189725864612
The carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed. An hour of	435.29182403988267
terror elapsed, for every spot they passed showed that they were on the	305.63700839936655
road back. At length he saw a dark mass, against which it seemed as if	453.43593321427943
the carriage was about to dash; but the vehicle turned to one side,	382.06434257442254
leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the	429.57683601975816
ramparts encircling Rome.	458.2500013336154
50243m	371.37158894486856
“_Mon dieu!_” cried Danglars, “we are not returning to Rome; then it is	353.0723476077952
not justice which is pursuing me! Gracious heavens; another idea	392.1085373199851
presents itself—what if they should be——”	446.6139220868688
His hair stood on end. He remembered those interesting stories, so	492.2595624778925
little believed in Paris, respecting Roman bandits; he remembered the	496.00618836275453
adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that	344.0944436845703
he should marry Mademoiselle Eugénie. “They are robbers, perhaps,” he	481.49238417741435
muttered.	340.3562643565059
Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road.	398.632827253017
Danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived	354.87199921617844
monuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details	309.56749059101764
Morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt	371.85301714875715
sure that he must be on the Appian Way. On the left, in a sort of	444.0735379496434
valley, he perceived a circular excavation. It was Caracalla’s circus.	313.6729259135559
On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it	396.0955815569639
stopped. At the same time the door was opened. “_Scendi!_” exclaimed a	491.6063906247025
commanding voice.	487.1793627415408
Danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak Italian, he	422.1146488825182
understood it very well. More dead than alive, he looked around him.	471.3995909507588
Four men surrounded him, besides the postilion.	361.04087718782245
“_Di quà_,” said one of the men, descending a little path leading out	439.83089424751745
of the Appian Way. Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and	461.1613585970761
had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were	339.96006832270905
following him. Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal	400.4704568359126
distances from one another, like sentinels. After walking for about ten	360.84235875277733
minutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his	332.8415695776218
guide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds;	317.3581352862384
three men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the	363.91717864978324
centre. He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move.	332.14988803841186
“_Avanti!_” said the same sharp and imperative voice.	401.88277913140894
This time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word and	431.1025365306764
gesture had not explained the speaker’s meaning, it was clearly	333.9631124013016
expressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that	331.13703270914544
he struck against the guide. This guide was our friend Peppino, who	331.5373595047707
dashed into the thicket of high weeds, through a path which none but	434.4145364872305
lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road.	455.0695005312863
Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges; the rock, half	455.3271865202553
open, afforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the	370.73425211486745
evil spirits in the fairy tales. The voice and gesture of the man who	396.75875173277996
followed Danglars ordered him to do the same. There was no longer any	309.30029735373824
doubt, the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditti. Danglars	302.2939940599356
acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions,	318.76594068913647
and who is rendered brave by fear. Notwithstanding his large stomach,	384.5179198334157
certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna, he	444.0348574826687
slid down like Peppino, and closing his eyes fell upon his feet. As he	365.795834311259
touched the ground, he opened his eyes.	411.1691201691706
50245m	432.8144771229307
The path was wide, but dark. Peppino, who cared little for being	478.0859145225718
recognized now that he was in his own territories, struck a light and	350.8952413513439
lit a torch. Two other men descended after Danglars forming the	431.49242987340034
rearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop, they came	365.60287726353056
by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors. The walls	445.4526803573736
were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the other, and which seemed	310.2810811691286
in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes, like	472.9644765491055
those which we see on the faces of the dead. A sentinel struck the	357.5238173637342
rings of his carbine against his left hand.	387.22048919404017
“Who comes there?” he cried.	419.3248711481954
“A friend, a friend!” said Peppino; “but where is the captain?”	466.5553778692176
“There,” said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious	462.76882946214795
crypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the	489.3398143745778
passage through the large arched openings.	375.8580616514783
“Fine spoil, captain, fine spoil!” said Peppino in Italian, and taking	464.89072537828383
Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening	385.9633645885783
resembling a door, through which they entered the apartment which the	432.92504523691395
captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place.	373.8098273377791
“Is this the man?” asked the captain, who was attentively reading	368.7177937986103
Plutarch’s _Life of Alexander_.	338.12836248118276
“Himself, captain—himself.”	437.6647981762923
“Very well, show him to me.”	340.2723541732033
At this rather impertinent order, Peppino raised his torch to the face	323.9021770397699
of Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes	309.1141874603245
burnt. His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and	311.56028680902045
hideous terror.	317.1672829150285
“The man is tired,” said the captain, “conduct him to his bed.”	460.29848247400133
“Oh,” murmured Danglars, “that bed is probably one of the coffins	428.4640432774132
hollowed in the wall, and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from	378.5082892487357
one of the poniards I see glistening in the darkness.”	463.88661999162963
From their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the	336.6136237201033
chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by	334.84496077907687
Albert de Morcerf reading _Cæsar’s Commentaries_, and by Danglars	372.60637849670957
studying the _Life of Alexander_. The banker uttered a groan and	452.9942950688968
followed his guide; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed. He no longer	481.7117587145808
possessed strength, will, power, or feeling; he followed where they led	415.07126255921094
him. At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase, and he	335.5193473974518
mechanically lifted his foot five or six times. Then a low door was	405.65709082408154
opened before him, and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead	341.62799319764
he entered a small room cut out of the rock. The cell was clean, though	319.6648725051711
empty, and dry, though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	466.48097465970494
earth. A bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one	417.4435993526008
corner. Danglars brightened up on beholding it, fancying that it gave	429.56642227174876
some promise of safety.	380.59735889077285
“Oh, God be praised,” he said; “it is a real bed!”	323.64298850048687
This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name	406.2514898533238
of God. He had not done so for ten years before.	340.9182689479594
“_Ecco!_” said the guide, and pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed	471.63448425454715
the door upon him.	325.3344239031364
A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner. If there had been no bolt,	471.67286869865814
it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the	412.54927949262816
garrison who held the catacombs of St. Sebastian, encamped round a	351.8944403445373
master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous Luigi Vampa.	312.3890004904854
Danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose existence he would not	302.01088966913306
believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in Paris; and not only did	463.59256966846857
he recognize him, but the cell in which Albert had been confined, and	483.2572436567291
which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers. These	362.87013090759797
recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars, and	427.15602309752836
restored him to some degree of tranquillity. Since the bandits had not	360.84809728141107
despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill him at all.	398.2969621588226
They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he had only a	496.78055952523914
few louis about him, he doubted not he would be ransomed.	354.0912927288164
He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he	438.2135623869296
considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his	468.02085414619955
own price at 8,000 crowns. Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000	310.282615479842
livres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left. With this sum	431.6906407884088
he could manage to keep out of difficulties. Therefore, tolerably	375.1478722019221
secure in being able to extricate himself from his position, provided	318.1207299409245
he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he	380.3203704637936
stretched himself on his bed, and after turning over two or three	424.595639254275
times, fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi	458.64129763914093
Vampa was studying.	404.32478548431374
 Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare	313.5518230956514
We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He awoke.	370.75714187931294
To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet	434.40095604338467
drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which	367.63495736903036
diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of	369.7551832976593
the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like	440.08113247670934
the continuation of some disagreeable dream. But in such a situation a	355.2513588110519
single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty.	364.94242223977176
“Yes, yes,” he murmured, “I am in the hands of the brigands of whom	375.2835642881206
Albert de Morcerf spoke.” His first idea was to breathe, that he might	308.283979623882
know whether he was wounded. He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_, the	385.94267945976924
only book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.	353.77194123927444
“No,” he cried, “they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed	368.86938285706213
me!” and he thrust his hands into his pockets. They were untouched; the	489.78816214985
hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were	364.9465772256698
in his trousers pocket, and in that of his greatcoat he found the	491.6529738775166
little note-case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs.	356.6771505266495
“Singular bandits!” he exclaimed; “they have left me my purse and	367.27415697826
pocket-book. As I was saying last night, they intend me to be ransomed.	301.4004164943731
Hello, here is my watch! Let me see what time it is.”	359.8769557115768
Danglars’ watch, one of Breguet’s repeaters, which he had carefully	472.01547817225753
wound up on the previous night, struck half past five. Without this,	379.49147370225455
Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did	479.39441212366137
not reach his cell. Should he demand an explanation from the bandits,	356.6855777399227
or should he wait patiently for them to propose it? The last	431.5083650032775
alternative seemed the most prudent, so he waited until twelve o’clock.	464.3862093274762
During all this time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight	423.69544558235543
o’clock, had been watching his door.	358.94260188457315
50249m	448.86427339056576
Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept	420.77050222513003
watch over him. He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but	333.6956490765583
from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he	386.73195824203424
approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful	392.8624871985072
of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent	433.8447505256511
forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars. “Faugh!” he	336.07089429823816
exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.	442.81653011691685
At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars,	383.9164657179188
wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.	299.2254266954518
He was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and a	361.1617347852466
flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around	469.53772144812115
his shoulders.	423.674332140771
“Ah, ha,” cried Danglars, “this fellow is more like an ogre than	438.26301348964745
anything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be very good	445.8470452118035
eating!”	321.36090133424034
We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as	401.5854537083446
though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black	459.30432117691464
bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring	415.58467183587567
voraciously.	497.73463853388057
“May I be hanged,” said Danglars, glancing at the bandit’s dinner	323.4492272839476
through the crevices of the door,—“may I be hanged if I can understand	469.70875443968146
how people can eat such filth!” and he withdrew to seat himself upon	369.3826432441706
his goat-skin, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy.	410.0692567911602
But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain	399.9897741151939
invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very	355.2538331488748
irresistibly to a fasting stomach. Danglars felt his own not to be very	350.11404239700164
well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the	320.8446195535097
bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful	448.72416141641827
vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes,	329.213497325267
which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said,	330.6534738946167
“Monsieur Deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.” He got	470.6111865973581
up and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head. Danglars knew	376.9443698238201
that he was heard, so he redoubled his blows.	481.77544040429893
“_Che cosa?_” asked the bandit.	471.0144538383079
“Come, come,” said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, “I	471.45669837022723
think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!”	439.33988176756696
But whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no	319.75168785287707
orders respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without	480.5684641556545
answering, went on with his dinner. Danglars’ feelings were hurt, and	306.1493864237559
not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker	356.81956934667494
threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another	360.49196741399766
word.	335.2180300162393
Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.	363.8429549356479
Danglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the	399.80555180737076
stomach, arose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of the door,	314.8957989282227
and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide. It was,	420.45623663018637
indeed, Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as	374.4488116934995
possible by seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between	464.87281743350394
his legs an earthen pan, containing chick-peas stewed with bacon. Near	404.1680975749061
the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a	492.6469558971271
flask of Orvieto. Peppino was decidedly an epicure. Danglars watched	490.55384102916764
these preparations and his mouth watered.	478.9300047032789
“Come,” he said to himself, “let me try if he will be more tractable	309.8315035566729
than the other;” and he tapped gently at the door.	329.8102211471922
“_On y va_,” (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting the house	449.5831043708049
of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idioms.	445.94808988358045
Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in	389.8196897214758
such a furious manner, “Put in your head!” But this was not the time	418.1417355976728
for recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said	402.6630822567971
with a gracious smile:	440.6030379256357
“Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?”	377.2246019516691
“Does your excellency happen to be hungry?”	448.18690830398134
“Happen to be hungry,—that’s pretty good, when I haven’t eaten for	406.5243871432672
twenty-four hours!” muttered Danglars. Then he added aloud, “Yes, sir,	357.3764060937086
I am hungry—very hungry.”	409.690000298955
“And your excellency wants something to eat?”	495.6875249817507
“At once, if possible”	412.46321739009795
“Nothing easier,” said Peppino. “Here you can get anything you want; by	475.5378358904651
paying for it, of course, as among honest folk.”	461.09590508359713
“Of course!” cried Danglars. “Although, in justice, the people who	445.5442290566042
arrest and imprison you, ought, at least, to feed you.”	486.35193039515974
“That is not the custom, excellency,” said Peppino.	370.76857046382963
“A bad reason,” replied Danglars, who reckoned on conciliating his	343.69634859983114
keeper; “but I am content. Let me have some dinner!”	492.6441814895343
“At once! What would your excellency like?”	435.8782908335402
And Peppino placed his pan on the ground, so that the steam rose	430.38207958564095
directly under the nostrils of Danglars. “Give your orders.”	411.0826137086301
“Have you kitchens here?”	349.2195314351646
“Kitchens?—of course—complete ones.”	496.3012354232918
“And cooks?”	346.34582968151017
“Excellent!”	497.4404598399021
“Well, a fowl, fish, game,—it signifies little, so that I eat.”	310.2098923152622
“As your excellency pleases. You mentioned a fowl, I think?”	470.1983705766286
“Yes, a fowl.”	450.4437567466707
Peppino, turning around, shouted, “A fowl for his excellency!” His	365.9185721848192
voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome, graceful, and	371.05631483379796
half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his	479.2763408451077
head, without the assistance of his hands.	487.1138754003581
“I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris,” murmured	459.2621072838768
Danglars.	371.84839878223556
“Here, your excellency,” said Peppino, taking the fowl from the young	465.2081212349833
bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool and	379.6672631783026
the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell. Danglars	419.1766971471088
asked for a knife and fork.	474.6678055250279
“Here, excellency,” said Peppino, offering him a little blunt knife and	389.5818352586821
a boxwood fork. Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the	404.18602477321656
other, and was about to cut up the fowl.	366.16458445953054
“Pardon me, excellency,” said Peppino, placing his hand on the banker’s	331.1449551005717
shoulder; “people pay here before they eat. They might not be	483.9652471379988
satisfied, and——”	427.08747843832975
“Ah, ha,” thought Danglars, “this is not so much like Paris, except	404.7971812161486
that I shall probably be skinned! Never mind, I’ll fix that all right.	318.5314906654837
I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I should think a	334.973929964597
fowl is worth about twelve sous at Rome.—There,” he said, throwing a	433.3659595258544
louis down.	318.5611953194007
Peppino picked up the louis, and Danglars again prepared to carve the	310.8155564103442
fowl.	471.88202510570073
“Stay a moment, your excellency,” said Peppino, rising; “you still owe	397.3483437224984
me something.”	379.76134274423
“I said they would skin me,” thought Danglars; but resolving to resist	303.8234552508999
the extortion, he said, “Come, how much do I owe you for this fowl?”	304.7458557549732
“Your excellency has given me a louis on account.”	397.4160864335599
“A louis on account for a fowl?”	459.5142439277163
“Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.”	483.9017634940725
Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke.	453.13179691312735
“Very droll,” he muttered, “very droll indeed,” and he again began to	406.4977637379345
carve the fowl, when Peppino stopped the baron’s right hand with his	382.9192139816313
left, and held out his other hand.	489.02842421770805
“Come, now,” he said.	472.7940552304698
“Is it not a joke?” said Danglars.	425.1218130039136
“We never joke,” replied Peppino, solemn as a Quaker.	403.5646546288793
“What! A hundred thousand francs for a fowl!”	470.78426929600073
“Ah, excellency, you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in	352.30880823155144
these horrible caves!”	463.07034137076766
“Come, come, this is very droll—very amusing—I allow; but, as I am very	305.1769082812788
hungry, pray allow me to eat. Stay, here is another louis for you.”	319.4791044387658
“Then that will make only 4,998 louis more,” said Peppino with the same	378.8071593253604
indifference. “I shall get them all in time.”	361.85123283976566
“Oh, as for that,” said Danglars, angry at this prolongation of the	398.2674514203054
jest,—“as for that you won’t get them at all. Go to the devil! You do	364.65915318406957
not know with whom you have to deal!”	316.02967553403306
50253m	321.54470780920957
Peppino made a sign, and the youth hastily removed the fowl. Danglars	360.5932533102036
threw himself upon his goat-skin, and Peppino, reclosing the door,	429.5201984535503
again began eating his peas and bacon. Though Danglars could not see	465.57296866272486
Peppino, the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation.	398.5017355438834
He was certainly eating, and noisily too, like an ill-bred man.	300.231557352074
“Brute!” said Danglars. Peppino pretended not to hear him, and without	383.3144218700355
even turning his head continued to eat slowly. Danglars’ stomach felt	433.08905816891547
so empty, that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it	329.3747052797514
again; still he had patience for another half-hour, which appeared to	419.50947728004496
him like a century. He again arose and went to the door.	326.68055165767004
“Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any longer, but tell me what	326.79865966100294
they want.”	433.0385808247255
“Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you want. Give	312.86615384354167
your orders, and we will execute them.”	336.8322944301284
“Then open the door directly.” Peppino obeyed. “Now look here, I want	368.5798522809247
something to eat! To eat—do you hear?”	351.32468009525377
“Are you hungry?”	400.6921356772571
“Come, you understand me.”	372.5415334143897
“What would your excellency like to eat?”	445.5410220927194
“A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in this	497.4714707232467
accursed place.”	342.5016494687312
“Bread? Very well. Holloa, there, some bread!” he called. The youth	360.9651888354109
brought a small loaf. “How much?” asked Danglars.	340.7025462273047
“Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,” said Peppino; “You	339.9788015951673
have paid two louis in advance.”	495.25503480423583
50255m	395.1620211319593
“What? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?”	454.7237334362348
“One hundred thousand francs,” repeated Peppino.	440.33935657729126
“But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!”	344.66363700921823
“We have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing	410.33514581647677
whether you eat much or little—whether you have ten dishes or one—it is	361.86315458894694
always the same price.”	467.1930570900409
“What, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is	466.404500820117
perfectly ridiculous—stupid! You had better tell me at once that you	438.7738809749517
intend starving me to death.”	308.125084135518
“Oh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide.	400.21294011601185
Pay and eat.”	368.47392497898477
“And what am I to pay with, brute?” said Danglars, enraged. “Do you	377.51712864406454
suppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?”	420.37484090278554
“Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be	301.9316878280664
fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.”	406.4135165240279
Danglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood	414.191765054622
the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just	325.360241249762
before.	319.5297474866554
“Come,” he said, “if I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be	381.71504303807365
satisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?”	328.530352529925
“Certainly,” said Peppino.	473.8116613171361
“But how can I pay them?”	451.3299114119419
“Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson &	361.62608827511934
French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these	438.2153737454827
gentlemen, and our banker shall take it.”	406.0049963340034
Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the	359.2647138954545
pen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed	437.17995545560314
it.	357.45280915541167
“Here,” he said, “here is a draft at sight.”	313.5798056103677
“And here is your fowl.”	322.9791059221049
Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl; it appeared very thin for the	374.67752762120307
price it had cost. As for Peppino, he examined the paper attentively,	330.56289061153956
put it into his pocket, and continued eating his peas.	419.99959846307803
 Chapter 116. The Pardon	336.352429220795
The next day Danglars was again hungry; certainly the air of that	484.5593189833452
dungeon was very provocative of appetite. The prisoner expected that he	480.5960809236682
would be at no expense that day, for like an economical man he had	458.3033078016168
concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of	391.0993924606025
his cell. But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had	428.48309030054037
forgotten that. He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave	492.54274296365224
to the roof of his mouth; then, no longer able to resist, he called	432.0548295322719
out. The sentinel opened the door; it was a new face. He thought it	411.7562869435525
would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance, so he	471.20992235605246
sent for Peppino.	479.592920155682
“Here I am, your excellency,” said Peppino, with an eagerness which	315.9595605726159
Danglars thought favorable to him. “What do you want?”	443.65149539151366
“Something to drink.”	461.0409875951007
“Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near Rome.”	362.80859793596227
“Then give me water,” cried Danglars, endeavoring to parry the blow.	345.19890943993363
“Oh, water is even more scarce than wine, your excellency,—there has	327.6643776622508
been such a drought.”	434.47654231539434
“Come,” thought Danglars, “it is the same old story.” And while he	470.4419378798574
smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke, he felt his	441.76336837674296
temples get moist with perspiration.	464.12566024814487
“Come, my friend,” said Danglars, seeing that he made no impression on	420.71266132127073
Peppino, “you will not refuse me a glass of wine?”	468.536445251064
“I have already told you that we do not sell at retail.”	307.462252214242
“Well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.”	342.40199197486703
“They are all the same price.”	356.25871665529894
“And what is that?”	377.42057243199724
“Twenty-five thousand francs a bottle.”	370.3594611613229
“Tell me,” cried Danglars, in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon30 alone	366.8099657412649
has been capable of revealing—“tell me that you wish to despoil me of	327.66682934658775
all; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal.”	325.2584351231113
“It is possible such may be the master’s intention.”	483.39648828102713
“The master?—who is he?”	449.722229581329
“The person to whom you were conducted yesterday.”	419.98124549158473
“Where is he?”	451.92030848280876
“Here.”	402.7991868768924
“Let me see him.”	373.345539759977
“Certainly.”	477.4573494110948
And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars.	466.5898480947411
“You sent for me?” he said to the prisoner.	479.11466223220935
“Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?”	459.90085656383724
“Yes, your excellency. What then?”	483.8264263479042
“How much do you require for my ransom?”	386.5743929826906
“Merely the 5,000,000 you have about you.” Danglars felt a dreadful	484.20615267671394
spasm dart through his heart.	422.3374310773526
“But this is all I have left in the world,” he said, “out of an immense	427.3394796442112
fortune. If you deprive me of that, take away my life also.”	404.22945929020807
“We are forbidden to shed your blood.”	406.11115365351174
“And by whom are you forbidden?”	439.3566060928313
“By him we obey.”	366.79820186716745
“You do, then, obey someone?”	324.04146174928485
“Yes, a chief.”	484.60336017712655
“I thought you said you were the chief?”	364.3651807240769
“So I am of these men; but there is another over me.”	473.8954568325746
“And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?”	440.73357489075556
“Yes.”	341.0541801644468
“But my purse will be exhausted.”	350.1733197658883
“Probably.”	419.1157485655425
“Come,” said Danglars, “will you take a million?”	440.6620362043964
“No.”	351.28138739454107
“Two millions?—three?—four? Come, four? I will give them to you on	359.40755138060985
condition that you let me go.”	449.4938368834006
“Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000? This is a	458.19119273098033
kind of usury, banker, that I do not understand.”	464.3580146107472
“Take all, then—take all, I tell you, and kill me!”	391.52071549830566
“Come, come, calm yourself. You will excite your blood, and that would	485.20643147841974
produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy. Be	429.9843989974843
more economical.”	325.87236638641946
“But when I have no more money left to pay you?” asked the infuriated	449.39768895706334
Danglars.	480.01295650889153
“Then you must suffer hunger.”	391.3859037953889
“Suffer hunger?” said Danglars, becoming pale.	312.53149947875966
“Most likely,” replied Vampa coolly.	428.56185641007187
“But you say you do not wish to kill me?”	460.1765978309291
“No.”	410.3030692928819
“And yet you will let me perish with hunger?”	432.1767949840589
“Ah, that is a different thing.”	401.01731292109935
“Well, then, wretches,” cried Danglars, “I will defy your infamous	449.3131154756969
calculations—I would rather die at once! You may torture, torment, kill	474.48718090421323
me, but you shall not have my signature again!”	400.0901869726473
“As your excellency pleases,” said Vampa, as he left the cell.	474.6648768672169
Danglars, raving, threw himself on the goat-skin. Who could these men	326.7916099156961
be? Who was the invisible chief? What could be his intentions towards	481.06372556072745
him? And why, when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed, might he	376.62259114978355
not also be? Oh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine	423.0119377251531
means of deceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue	449.1625556525199
him with such incomprehensible vengeance. But to die? For the first	369.82824117340203
time in his life, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread	311.25144542768766
and desire; the time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists	440.2726253895263
in the mind of every human creature, arrested his attention and called	456.6272772947157
out with every pulsation of his heart, “Thou shalt die!”	410.63291118876475
Danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies,	302.7554401755163
then despairs, and at last, by the very force of desperation, sometimes	473.64433305044963
succeeds in eluding its pursuers. Danglars meditated an escape; but the	392.49875078325255
walls were solid rock, a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to	376.7360415858153
the cell, and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually	457.18294255839953
passed. His resolution not to sign lasted two days, after which he	490.5987225944536
offered a million for some food. They sent him a magnificent supper,	486.5590493581354
and took his million.	485.4622371391257
From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer, but to have	338.65614775062215
everything he wanted. At the end of twelve days, after having made a	469.48308520298383
splendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only	441.848005997295
50,000 francs left. Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just	299.8406894453099
abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left,	474.7239531541146
and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of	366.4568483514368
privation—he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of	480.96581264146585
madness.	425.17666819501034
He, who for so long a time had forgotten God, began to think that	428.48947476852385
miracles were possible—that the accursed cavern might be discovered by	430.66556207831013
the officers of the Papal States, who would release him; that then he	498.49648684775104
would have 50,000 remaining, which would be sufficient to save him from	355.0804403132576
starvation; and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to	347.25647177746686
him, and as he prayed he wept. Three days passed thus, during which his	480.86963838974975
prayers were frequent, if not heartfelt. Sometimes he was delirious,	424.4987921186973
and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he, also, was	486.91896243544375
dying of hunger.	362.90154992259244
On the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse. He had	353.56601346110136
picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was	459.53731553996306
beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell. Then	354.5779251918708
he entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food;	486.9306189882211
he offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread. But Peppino did	316.1415497384813
not answer. On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the	348.19330296264604
cell.	327.7136010012005
“Are you not a Christian?” he said, falling on his knees. “Do you wish	431.23447323123014
to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of Heaven, is a brother? Oh, my	417.68434995787186
former friends, my former friends!” he murmured, and fell with his face	434.7852158684548
to the ground. Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, “The chief, the	464.9266077983241
chief!”	427.3739785950359
“Here I am,” said Vampa, instantly appearing; “what do you want?”	392.09217781391055
“Take my last gold,” muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book,	315.85445341898424
“and let me live here; I ask no more for liberty—I only ask to live!”	312.8647146522279
“Then you suffer a great deal?”	421.24016463433645
“Oh, yes, yes, cruelly!”	321.5098537373535
“Still, there have been men who suffered more than you.”	307.7054632304617
“I do not think so.”	468.8248260588539
“Yes; those who have died of hunger.”	481.2709134225846
Danglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he had	461.73587617703
seen groaning on his bed. He struck his forehead on the ground and	393.932493358147
groaned. “Yes,” he said, “there have been some who have suffered more	374.65839633893995
than I have, but then they must have been martyrs at least.”	475.6174200541439
“Do you repent?” asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars’	315.7993817703789
hair to stand on end. His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish	311.35756842946745
objects, and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak, half	331.7080492351216
lost in the shadow of a stone column.	427.24516644290463
“Of what must I repent?” stammered Danglars.	455.7170501904043
“Of the evil you have done,” said the voice.	341.87486087985104
“Oh, yes; oh, yes, I do indeed repent.” And he struck his breast with	423.2584974803477
his emaciated fist.	422.4781403941418
“Then I forgive you,” said the man, dropping his cloak, and advancing	361.0276215504424
to the light.	463.9532146653859
“The Count of Monte Cristo!” said Danglars, more pale from terror than	495.9530397155188
he had been just before from hunger and misery.	400.09181807227156
“You are mistaken—I am not the Count of Monte Cristo.”	301.56601317270537
“Then who are you?”	358.5313720436112
50261m	396.77912516271897
“I am he whom you sold and dishonored—I am he whose betrothed you	395.8690754071967
prostituted—I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise	473.71230012866374
yourself to fortune—I am he whose father you condemned to die of	332.831669335068
hunger—I am he whom you also condemned to starvation, and who yet	344.84824835467424
forgives you, because he hopes to be forgiven—I am Edmond Dantès!”	356.5818266531781
Danglars uttered a cry, and fell prostrate.	459.5794129267822
“Rise,” said the count, “your life is safe; the same good fortune has	477.66848005445775
not happened to your accomplices—one is mad, the other dead. Keep the	482.2735332136392
50,000 francs you have left—I give them to you. The 5,000,000 you stole	418.7173269951786
from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand. And	385.92228658959937
now eat and drink; I will entertain you tonight. Vampa, when this man	454.8767352078067
is satisfied, let him be free.”	459.25202618499054
Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he raised	315.9388728206376
his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow,	495.06415476712243
before which the bandits bowed.	338.27093100548507
According to the count’s directions, Danglars was waited on by Vampa,	429.30841917106727
who brought him the best wine and fruits of Italy; then, having	430.605851521799
conducted him to the road, and pointed to the post-chaise, left him	380.80866370402214
leaning against a tree. He remained there all night, not knowing where	419.1857436553837
he was. When daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream; he was	387.59577342929276
thirsty, and dragged himself towards it. As he stooped down to drink,	466.5153542668146
he saw that his hair had become entirely white.	354.11512807963004
 Chapter 117. The Fifth of October	369.55626735760404
It was about six o’clock in the evening; an opal-colored light, through	325.7648795807923
which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue	355.17172930171347
ocean. The heat of the day had gradually decreased, and a light breeze	476.22785457017915
arose, seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the	324.8529366012477
burning siesta of the south. A delicious zephyr played along the coasts	447.4726081707124
of the Mediterranean, and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume	490.82215904381576
of plants, mingled with the fresh smell of the sea.	403.93862355063436
A light yacht, chaste and elegant in its form, was gliding amidst the	459.2013040870369
first dews of night over the immense lake, extending from Gibraltar to	449.00572673071144
the Dardanelles, and from Tunis to Venice. The vessel resembled a swan	371.24445019049426
with its wings opened towards the wind, gliding on the water. It	360.8137662332678
advanced swiftly and gracefully, leaving behind it a glittering stretch	450.9134062239359
of foam. By degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but	310.3922220694791
as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen	440.94344549489506
mythology, its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave,	455.984659300009
as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of Amphitrite, who	363.14360141358486
in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle.	452.2307386507497
The yacht moved rapidly on, though there did not appear to be	347.673908150191
sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl.	467.06728232204233
Standing on the prow was a tall man, of a dark complexion, who saw with	409.4226332524741
dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the	381.46018667328906
shape of a cone, which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of	402.87753392262147
a Catalan.	489.9773403775858
“Is that Monte Cristo?” asked the traveller, to whose orders the yacht	490.6772875524779
was for the time submitted, in a melancholy voice.	311.90324166005263
“Yes, your excellency,” said the captain, “we have reached it.”	390.925898024712
“We have reached it!” repeated the traveller in an accent of	355.69538667441316
indescribable sadness.	476.0777027497592
Then he added, in a low tone, “Yes; that is the haven.”	414.2138017581815
And then he again plunged into a train of thought, the character of	362.70695975809736
which was better revealed by a sad smile, than it would have been by	474.18107294722665
tears. A few minutes afterwards a flash of light, which was	471.1123404538068
extinguished instantly, was seen on the land, and the sound of firearms	347.9723484156956
reached the yacht.	496.5613754473201
“Your excellency,” said the captain, “that was the land signal, will	385.1530060814018
you answer yourself?”	328.19501526341537
“What signal?”	397.79636867046787
The captain pointed towards the island, up the side of which ascended a	413.1724471274964
volume of smoke, increasing as it rose.	303.801949255739
“Ah, yes,” he said, as if awaking from a dream. “Give it to me.”	321.037334629911
The captain gave him a loaded carbine; the traveller slowly raised it,	333.2713649523128
and fired in the air. Ten minutes afterwards, the sails were furled,	412.48898775027976
and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor.	465.1108361681345
The gig was already lowered, and in it were four oarsmen and a	478.82328286043304
coxswain. The traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the	412.0038335912997
stern of the boat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his	380.74038772228084
accommodation, stood up with his arms crossed. The rowers waited, their	421.48589892411064
oars half lifted out of the water, like birds drying their wings.	324.12151083207556
50265m	387.83297935375657
“Give way,” said the traveller. The eight oars fell into the sea	451.0854216523751
simultaneously without splashing a drop of water, and the boat,	321.2624031533046
yielding to the impulsion, glided forward. In an instant they found	321.7316892645839
themselves in a little harbor, formed in a natural creek; the boat	327.5131486411375
grounded on the fine sand.	431.15474387444476
“Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of	430.45915512015847
our men, they will carry you ashore?” The young man answered this	429.9343953606001
invitation with a gesture of indifference, and stepped out of the boat;	468.0062529838783
the sea immediately rose to his waist.	428.0714320532138
“Ah, your excellency,” murmured the pilot, “you should not have done	302.7718286816405
so; our master will scold us for it.”	430.1328633792242
The young man continued to advance, following the sailors, who chose a	455.14343398019406
firm footing. Thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man	457.00589079965505
stamped on the ground to shake off the wet, and looked around for	416.24660802271796
someone to show him his road, for it was quite dark. Just as he turned,	338.76187097056805
a hand rested on his shoulder, and a voice which made him shudder	480.4626664374081
exclaimed:	421.62831240991216
“Good-evening, Maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!”	322.67035843658346
“Ah, is it you, count?” said the young man, in an almost joyful accent,	434.09608101398896
pressing Monte Cristo’s hand with both his own.	349.63443259796077
“Yes; you see I am as exact as you are. But you are dripping, my dear	487.1911910106064
fellow; you must change your clothes, as Calypso said to Telemachus.	372.5358485778136
Come, I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon	392.97059710134494
forget fatigue and cold.”	332.63645106930835
Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around; indeed,	411.95791588750507
Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left	382.5379211906662
without being paid, or uttering a word. Already the sound of their oars	382.3341507077557
might be heard as they returned to the yacht.	459.73605738279423
“Oh, yes,” said the count, “you are looking for the sailors.”	364.252394789487
“Yes, I paid them nothing, and yet they are gone.”	494.6819533980828
“Never mind that, Maximilian,” said Monte Cristo, smiling. “I have made	331.3433053260467
an agreement with the navy, that the access to my island shall be free	343.3333280243779
of all charge. I have made a bargain.”	306.56189637265857
Morrel looked at the count with surprise. “Count,” he said, “you are	368.38059242844395
not the same here as in Paris.”	348.63082130632773
“How so?”	460.33479036505713
“Here you laugh.” The count’s brow became clouded.	465.26179135123004
“You are right to recall me to myself, Maximilian,” he said; “I was	462.5999718362321
delighted to see you again, and forgot for the moment that all	376.21829036416557
happiness is fleeting.”	441.94931506068
“Oh, no, no, count,” cried Maximilian, seizing the count’s hands, “pray	436.3111743280665
laugh; be happy, and prove to me, by your indifference, that life is	382.2942214833296
endurable to sufferers. Oh, how charitable, kind, and good you are; you	410.707174993334
affect this gayety to inspire me with courage.”	355.71277805306386
“You are wrong, Morrel; I was really happy.”	344.069124879751
“Then you forget me, so much the better.”	387.83719710876767
“How so?”	464.1219762207005
“Yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor, when he entered the	360.3410463908084
arena, ‘He who is about to die salutes you.’”	406.51452708375916
“Then you are not consoled?” asked the count, surprised.	307.2542271680716
“Oh,” exclaimed Morrel, with a glance full of bitter reproach, “do you	435.4576287254614
think it possible that I could be?”	351.29438199774904
“Listen,” said the count. “Do you understand the meaning of my words?	492.9103540211307
You cannot take me for a commonplace man, a mere rattle, emitting a	488.50520754182367
vague and senseless noise. When I ask you if you are consoled, I speak	342.0442430614696
to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets. Well, Morrel,	411.01855486663965
let us both examine the depths of your heart. Do you still feel the	466.0208161170217
same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded	360.3935992512146
lion? Have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased	423.60212950160286
in the grave? Are you still actuated by the regret which drags the	467.3164424355309
living to the pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the	458.51213841959424
prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred? Has the loss	441.4628783368632
of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep? Oh, my dear friend,	497.0992048460972
if this be the case,—if you can no longer weep, if your frozen heart be	467.34883145887386
dead, if you put all your trust in God, then, Maximilian, you are	440.26495324795644
consoled—do not complain.”	342.75616408476645
“Count,” said Morrel, in a firm and at the same time soft voice,	488.5826259547986
“listen to me, as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven, though	348.0834424091367
he remains on earth; I come to die in the arms of a friend. Certainly,	414.9257140247936
there are people whom I love. I love my sister Julie,—I love her	440.7448707642112
husband Emmanuel; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last	328.9135116508753
moments. My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; I could not	365.54444853388196
bear to see her suffer. Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand,	445.14822890205056
and alarm the house with his cries. You, count, who are more than	308.45968703722093
mortal, will, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you	349.6222993957329
not?”	487.8867135504631
50267m	317.44871293470476
“My friend,” said the count, “I have still one doubt,—are you weak	458.96337752493423
enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings?”	456.83968433888754
“No, indeed,—I am calm,” said Morrel, giving his hand to the count; “my	379.52413372571795
pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual. No, I feel that I have	369.52874194533103
reached the goal, and I will go no farther. You told me to wait and	433.39414871912015
hope; do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser? I waited a month,	334.6354161383318
or rather I suffered for a month! I did hope (man is a poor wretched	494.61790747246766
creature), I did hope. What I cannot tell,—something wonderful, an	402.03636047638173
absurdity, a miracle,—of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled	302.65830012766935
with our reason that folly we call hope. Yes, I did wait—yes, I did	325.3336428548064
hope, count, and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking	452.7572463506102
together, you have unconsciously wounded, tortured my heart, for every	493.9985332376793
word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me. Oh, count,	457.0657547486522
I shall sleep calmly, deliciously in the arms of death.”	396.55655121672635
Morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder.	417.52502806221634
“My friend,” continued Morrel, “you named the fifth of October as the	463.72183389736256
end of the period of waiting,—today is the fifth of October,” he took	360.59126514151797
out his watch, “it is now nine o’clock,—I have yet three hours to	476.559849864005
live.”	315.2648901857306
“Be it so,” said the count, “come.” Morrel mechanically followed the	370.79389798741687
count, and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it. He felt	376.6885526141365
a carpet under his feet, a door opened, perfumes surrounded him, and a	402.6996014182141
brilliant light dazzled his eyes. Morrel hesitated to advance; he	489.51533480474177
dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw. Monte Cristo drew him	318.5590681718024
in gently.	344.91814589896126
“Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life,	444.7196784262186
like those ancient Romans, who when condemned by Nero, their emperor	305.2768178336164
and heir, sat down at a table covered with flowers, and gently glided	422.2393403835
into death, amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses?”	426.81921856338784
Morrel smiled. “As you please,” he said; “death is always death,—that	411.0577830054001
is forgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life, and therefore from	339.0304028593681
grief.”	449.895768826178
He sat down, and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him. They were	446.0466106777076
in the marvellous dining-room before described, where the statues had	382.1872202009432
baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers. Morrel	421.17504517884777
had looked carelessly around, and had probably noticed nothing.	446.81730713897826
“Let us talk like men,” he said, looking at the count.	316.43115066920507
“Go on!”	377.3327811291737
“Count,” said Morrel, “you are the epitome of all human knowledge, and	306.29108366905507
you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world	442.8361198387113
than ours.”	451.0171615234607
“There is something true in what you say,” said the count, with that	377.5213413158474
smile which made him so handsome; “I have descended from a planet	473.5256846691887
called grief.”	370.48230567961014
50269m	388.17238956777595
“I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for	365.3545476739754
instance, you told me to live, and I did live; you told me to hope, and	338.57544886727743
I almost did so. I am almost inclined to ask you, as though you had	400.23703189818946
experienced death, ‘is it painful to die?’”	358.34582274797367
Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness. “Yes,”	450.01372693444057
he said, “yes, doubtless it is painful, if you violently break the	407.50834966228234
outer covering which obstinately begs for life. If you plunge a dagger	439.6377271957542
into your flesh, if you insinuate a bullet into your brain, which the	372.64228238530234
least shock disorders,—then certainly, you will suffer pain, and you	325.06727966890907
will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a	383.5005046437889
price.”	373.45465081237364
“Yes; I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death, as	439.1112062385754
well as in life; the only thing is to understand it.”	478.311094854187
“You have spoken truly, Maximilian; according to the care we bestow	385.8800586087791
upon it, death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse, or an	433.2363395856322
enemy who violently drags the soul from the body. Some day, when the	338.3320491636651
world is much older, and when mankind will be masters of all the	424.9994125751439
destructive powers in nature, to serve for the general good of	340.37284877421405
humanity; when mankind, as you were just saying, have discovered the	416.4737715873489
secrets of death, then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous	430.34137424629904
as a slumber in the arms of your beloved.”	398.2435308625654
“And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?”	390.73750151779456
“Yes.”	439.3550071417742
Morrel extended his hand. “Now I understand,” he said, “why you had me	367.83644281349115
brought here to this desolate spot, in the midst of the ocean, to this	470.25100711375154
subterranean palace; it was because you loved me, was it not, count? It	391.7902444466382
was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet	492.8540918337584
means of death of which we were speaking; a death without agony, a	409.1427312584861
death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine’s name	314.9958011127384
and pressing your hand.”	459.40256970284906
“Yes, you have guessed rightly, Morrel,” said the count, “that is what	475.52358466458827
I intended.”	416.0946008479174
“Thanks; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer, is sweet to	445.29314150701447
my heart.”	328.21600888966856
“Do you then regret nothing?”	466.6335695652268
“No,” replied Morrel.	390.84808064926415
“Not even me?” asked the count with deep emotion. Morrel’s clear eye	489.4160023514023
was for the moment clouded, then it shone with unusual lustre, and a	454.91825850429245
large tear rolled down his cheek.	379.0511887236463
“What,” said the count, “do you still regret anything in the world, and	446.1367309990912
yet die?”	428.0454617921338
“Oh, I entreat you,” exclaimed Morrel in a low voice, “do not speak	399.6821758925404
another word, count; do not prolong my punishment.”	413.6720271937615
The count fancied that he was yielding, and this belief revived the	331.09931702146207
horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the Château d’If.	424.5577605735745
“I am endeavoring,” he thought, “to make this man happy; I look upon	482.27725344099815
this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil	461.26735694101257
I have wrought. Now, supposing I am deceived, supposing this man has	424.6536881353619
not been unhappy enough to merit happiness. Alas, what would become of	310.6405417714852
me who can only atone for evil by doing good?”	385.6164277125604
50271m	452.3985929576495
Then he said aloud: “Listen, Morrel, I see your grief is great, but	434.95338966016715
still you do not like to risk your soul.” Morrel smiled sadly.	387.3074709998739
“Count,” he said, “I swear to you my soul is no longer my own.”	362.5137804885887
“Maximilian, you know I have no relation in the world. I have	386.48135886159247
accustomed myself to regard you as my son: well, then, to save my son,	458.0317125528952
I will sacrifice my life, nay, even my fortune.”	378.76764338168175
“What do you mean?”	308.4638688246946
“I mean, that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all	329.6637933547105
the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune. Morrel, I	423.27757591614596
possess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you; with such a	337.4642603324281
fortune you can attain every wish. Are you ambitious? Every career is	438.38999341507207
open to you. Overturn the world, change its character, yield to mad	436.2809545108563
ideas, be even criminal—but live.”	434.85515655199515
“Count, I have your word,” said Morrel coldly; then taking out his	301.2302164032808
watch, he added, “It is half-past eleven.”	430.32108795409806
“Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?”	456.7649768030419
“Then let me go,” said Maximilian, “or I shall think you did not love	454.7628906301064
me for my own sake, but for yours;” and he arose.	302.8513960095568
“It is well,” said Monte Cristo whose countenance brightened at these	497.79068292104796
words; “you wish it—you are inflexible. Yes, as you said, you are	433.0332246660307
indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you. Sit down, Morrel, and	328.75479318856316
wait.”	347.2199155568626
Morrel obeyed; the count arose, and unlocking a closet with a key	486.1292254990717
suspended from his gold chain, took from it a little silver casket,	357.09125349840605
beautifully carved and chased, the corners of which represented four	431.03765346479474
bending figures, similar to the Caryatides, the forms of women, symbols	372.7997434711783
of the angels aspiring to heaven.	397.54502292697475
He placed the casket on the table; then opening it took out a little	329.0989537883116
golden box, the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring.	480.0209300330865
This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid, of which it was	305.09347865318904
impossible to discover the color, owing to the reflection of the	441.97107146392193
polished gold, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, which ornamented the box.	337.04634721529595
It was a mixed mass of blue, red, and gold.	418.9736979699737
The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon, and	371.55695190600727
offered it to Morrel, fixing a long steadfast glance upon him. It was	424.45479300265663
then observable that the substance was greenish.	337.3873928421992
“This is what you asked for,” he said, “and what I promised to give	375.60462682603026
you.”	454.0053320112256
“I thank you from the depths of my heart,” said the young man, taking	330.5273997596612
the spoon from the hands of Monte Cristo. The count took another spoon,	430.0720815311695
and again dipped it into the golden box. “What are you going to do, my	397.0717432896379
friend?” asked Morrel, arresting his hand.	418.4113863250605
“Well, the fact is, Morrel, I was thinking that I too am weary of life,	379.19267618578874
and since an opportunity presents itself——”	475.88894884897695
“Stay!” said the young man. “You who love, and are beloved; you, who	444.74177842710543
have faith and hope,—oh, do not follow my example. In your case it	460.37418643392823
would be a crime. Adieu, my noble and generous friend, adieu; I will go	386.5091093080364
and tell Valentine what you have done for me.”	392.23283098878244
And slowly, though without any hesitation, only waiting to press the	421.9019224868325
count’s hand fervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered	367.4010030521447
by Monte Cristo. Then they were both silent. Ali, mute and attentive,	444.6849035045182
brought the pipes and coffee, and disappeared. By degrees, the light of	404.81831544182666
the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held	377.5292390593084
them, and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel. Seated	446.6825025839189
opposite to him, Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow, and Morrel saw	456.9858572036953
nothing but the bright eyes of the count. An overpowering sadness took	315.61211325848035
possession of the young man, his hands relaxed their hold, the objects	306.79387014261437
in the room gradually lost their form and color, and his disturbed	482.3214811426393
vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall.	377.966140221709
50273m	484.2301618443031
“Friend,” he cried, “I feel that I am dying; thanks!”	327.16597051449344
He made a last effort to extend his hand, but it fell powerless beside	469.7350534421597
him. Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled, not with the	455.0533510620687
strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the	394.4653292261678
secrets of his heart, but with the benevolent kindness of a father for	469.2025371100684
a child. At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature,	385.72266867103474
his form, nearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against	491.09726573916134
the red tapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the	450.41272041819485
attitude of an avenging angel. Morrel, overpowered, turned around in	319.6843282486433
the armchair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein. A change of	314.4496433720988
ideas presented themselves to his brain, like a new design on the	440.3564110125245
kaleidoscope. Enervated, prostrate, and breathless, he became	460.72227329702184
unconscious of outward objects; he seemed to be entering that vague	448.61073318847485
delirium preceding death. He wished once again to press the count’s	349.83424495913306
hand, but his own was immovable. He wished to articulate a last	483.939916219393
farewell, but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat, like a	476.809571078919
stone at the mouth of a sepulchre. Involuntarily his languid eyes	406.15121437154073
closed, and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to	350.7314808793056
move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped.	457.94426450001674
The count had just opened a door. Immediately a brilliant light from	394.7389749550737
the next room, or rather from the palace adjoining, shone upon the room	440.16760518438775
in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep. Then he saw a woman	334.00682677565834
of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the	441.1501668893696
two rooms. Pale, and sweetly smiling, she looked like an angel of mercy	328.66842127595595
conjuring the angel of vengeance.	452.7054454160685
“Is it heaven that opens before me?” thought the dying man; “that angel	476.21755806649446
resembles the one I have lost.”	307.81711535900087
Monte Cristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman, who advanced	373.189008293067
towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips.	495.94550878726125
“Valentine, Valentine!” he mentally ejaculated; but his lips uttered no	463.31393223623724
sound, and as though all his strength were centred in that internal	362.2332165564753
emotion, he sighed and closed his eyes. Valentine rushed towards him;	372.1720656795869
his lips again moved.	340.51864525208737
“He is calling you,” said the count; “he to whom you have confided your	354.5760831947364
destiny—he from whom death would have separated you, calls you to him.	404.3650931717122
Happily, I vanquished death. Henceforth, Valentine, you will never	436.83445155494326
again be separated on earth, since he has rushed into death to find	327.04407278827676
you. Without me, you would both have died. May God accept my atonement	342.8747263581439
in the preservation of these two existences!”	469.3028285871621
Valentine seized the count’s hand, and in her irresistible impulse of	381.2770561679683
joy carried it to her lips.	321.9873561625139
50275m	401.6618932801999
“Oh, thank me again!” said the count; “tell me till you are weary, that	446.7876506375319
I have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much I require	311.7239420553312
this assurance.”	381.6021682649234
“Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my heart,” said Valentine; “and if	330.48584725366476
you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude, oh, then, ask Haydée! ask my	497.28120330595743
beloved sister Haydée, who ever since our departure from France, has	370.37822316091683
caused me to wait patiently for this happy day, while talking to me of	464.6143413386932
you.”	323.36111770728024
“You then love Haydée?” asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain	411.6528910181097
endeavored to dissimulate.	446.2825944159383
“Oh, yes, with all my soul.”	456.06185610791397
“Well, then, listen, Valentine,” said the count; “I have a favor to ask	300.41942260695555
of you.”	383.7109188449057
“Of me? Oh, am I happy enough for that?”	441.4696924054065
“Yes; you have called Haydée your sister,—let her become so indeed,	390.25484767536324
Valentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me;	357.62790545420887
protect her, for” (the count’s voice was thick with emotion)	475.10727362687885
“henceforth she will be alone in the world.”	473.6007484125561
“Alone in the world!” repeated a voice behind the count, “and why?”	396.4423640704143
Monte Cristo turned around; Haydée was standing pale, motionless,	325.8648850479325
looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement.	420.1650155349231
“Because tomorrow, Haydée, you will be free; you will then assume your	304.91454230732313
proper position in society, for I will not allow my destiny to	362.7136011131428
overshadow yours. Daughter of a prince, I restore to you the riches and	473.9071307001615
name of your father.”	336.41791888695576
Haydée became pale, and lifting her transparent hands to heaven,	314.8488713796215
exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears, “Then you leave me, my lord?”	429.5962646078093
“Haydée, Haydée, you are young and beautiful; forget even my name, and	319.9368561769768
be happy.”	476.08704893775695
“It is well,” said Haydée; “your order shall be executed, my lord; I	422.29989237531754
will forget even your name, and be happy.” And she stepped back to	421.7870813801763
retire.	299.9487298316444
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, who was supporting the head of	420.05108302460116
Morrel on her shoulder, “do you not see how pale she is? Do you not see	431.02304269511023
how she suffers?”	443.79829493439036
Haydée answered with a heartrending expression,	403.2891390179351
“Why should he understand this, my sister? He is my master, and I am	463.86287186515983
his slave; he has the right to notice nothing.”	456.4488020374795
The count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost	328.6231511674505
recesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he	498.19688846864096
could not bear their brilliancy.	337.0037708125245
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “can my suspicions be correct?	359.78997606591093
Haydée, would it please you not to leave me?”	400.80095540809555
“I am young,” gently replied Haydée; “I love the life you have made so	346.2374648542609
sweet to me, and I should be sorry to die.”	362.3439912393941
“You mean, then, that if I leave you, Haydée——”	436.2051880576255
“I should die; yes, my lord.”	410.2332832195986
“Do you then love me?”	340.80990239531013
“Oh, Valentine, he asks if I love him. Valentine, tell him if you love	337.4399651838221
Maximilian.”	442.59784347606825
The count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his arms, and	359.65770406440873
Haydée, uttering a cry, sprang into them.	451.8123462353577
“Oh, yes,” she cried, “I do love you! I love you as one loves a father,	388.2373767426639
brother, husband! I love you as my life, for you are the best, the	486.33353157789577
noblest of created beings!”	339.12543788696127
50277m	313.70306877037586
“Let it be, then, as you wish, sweet angel; God has sustained me in my	303.6772820989124
struggle with my enemies, and has given me this reward; he will not let	299.3791796240107
me end my triumph in suffering; I wished to punish myself, but he has	338.69528289289326
pardoned me. Love me then, Haydée! Who knows? perhaps your love will	353.3844688118431
make me forget all that I do not wish to remember.”	348.3160943614898
“What do you mean, my lord?”	445.87254678965803
“I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty	346.4242074340202
years of slow experience; I have but you in the world, Haydée; through	444.1139472737059
you I again take hold on life, through you I shall suffer, through you	347.9754034437092
rejoice.”	444.2598593871463
“Do you hear him, Valentine?” exclaimed Haydée; “he says that through	382.4921469151116
me he will suffer—through _me_, who would yield my life for his.”	304.15579362242556
The count withdrew for a moment. “Have I discovered the truth?” he	497.84319567446437
said; “but whether it be for recompense or punishment, I accept my	454.8888873778574
fate. Come, Haydée, come!” and throwing his arm around the young girl’s	362.97684565541505
waist, he pressed the hand of Valentine, and disappeared.	444.8675124899496
50279m	322.5681813205062
An hour had nearly passed, during which Valentine, breathless and	318.84534276273934
motionless, watched steadfastly over Morrel. At length she felt his	405.1570474652599
heart beat, a faint breath played upon his lips, a slight shudder,	386.77831744536934
announcing the return of life, passed through the young man’s frame. At	413.411843456058
length his eyes opened, but they were at first fixed and	478.71306599415635
expressionless; then sight returned, and with it feeling and grief.	303.6244129320761
“Oh,” he cried, in an accent of despair, “the count has deceived me; I	355.9494014836457
am yet living;” and extending his hand towards the table, he seized a	484.55478515253213
knife.	372.8893800004385
“Dearest,” exclaimed Valentine, with her adorable smile, “awake, and	447.1960516178564
look at me!” Morrel uttered a loud exclamation, and frantic, doubtful,	465.79118180510227
dazzled, as though by a celestial vision, he fell upon his knees.	373.21125422451075
The next morning at daybreak, Valentine and Morrel were walking	425.39318731258516
arm-in-arm on the seashore, Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had	405.0145957705694
appeared in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and,	405.2835318166073
finally, how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.	474.9267801813525
They had found the door of the grotto opened, and gone forth; on the	372.8200896245008
azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars.	390.59795572740234
Morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks, apparently	314.59177868432914
awaiting a sign from them to advance, and pointed him out to Valentine.	372.57123661219185
“Ah, it is Jacopo,” she said, “the captain of the yacht;” and she	494.1143480300763
beckoned him towards them.	387.27594441586115
“Do you wish to speak to us?” asked Morrel.	449.95647390957186
“I have a letter to give you from the count.”	390.31760515723806
“From the count!” murmured the two young people.	299.90803802055956
“Yes; read it.”	377.7205122455644
50281m	410.6691335936058
Morrel opened the letter, and read:	370.8222132409765
“My Dear Maximilian,	465.9156709143382
“There is a felucca for you at anchor. Jacopo will carry you to	361.8488768766246
Leghorn, where Monsieur Noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he	467.4996991576805
wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar. All that is in this	423.11668374758267
grotto, my friend, my house in the Champs-Élysées, and my château at	342.67583949043683
Tréport, are the marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dantès upon the son	361.2924418741237
of his old master, Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them	341.2834744188166
with you; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune	411.2443140978881
reverting to her from her father, now a madman, and her brother who	428.96894990670916
died last September with his mother. Tell the angel who will watch over	314.42336090802576
your future destiny, Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who, like	468.7963123410774
Satan, thought himself for an instant equal to God, but who now	322.06962294296324
acknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme	479.01833767259575
power and infinite wisdom. Perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse	365.6703823853423
he feels in his heart. As for you, Morrel, this is the secret of my	353.27106124777515
conduct towards you. There is neither happiness nor misery in the	356.41312749342467
world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing	437.3253963198672
more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience	367.484464349002
supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we	431.7178456392368
may appreciate the enjoyments of living.	402.93016516955123
“Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never	433.5659016622494
forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to	305.6904874155382
man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,—‘_Wait and	462.8223589139436
hope_.’—Your friend,	416.36639840220806
“Edmond Dantès, _Count of Monte Cristo_.”	389.6375304620366
50282m	480.66415725576695
During the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the	442.9921366008939
first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother,	394.3450187364317
she became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not	496.2919878757197
the less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her	317.4194575700953
happiness cost her very dear.	451.2975119796508
Morrel looked around uneasily.	335.4347088398131
“But,” he said, “the count’s generosity is too overwhelming; Valentine	479.7610407406867
will be satisfied with my humble fortune. Where is the count, friend?	338.14281039626314
Lead me to him.”	488.5949293084259
Jacopo pointed towards the horizon.	421.1906778683116
“What do you mean?” asked Valentine. “Where is the count?—where is	408.4670973919468
Haydée?”	420.56086102953043
“Look!” said Jacopo.	346.8088292811683
The eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and	465.3742194712712
on the blue line separating the sky from the Mediterranean Sea, they	340.1477270331605
perceived a large white sail.	353.9184348726566
“Gone,” said Morrel; “gone!—adieu, my friend—adieu, my father!”	495.17715649649654
“Gone,” murmured Valentine; “adieu, my sweet Haydée—adieu, my sister!”	424.59030694619196
“Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?” said Morrel with	402.35564698059454
tearful eyes.	496.71327979787105
“Darling,” replied Valentine, “has not the count just told us that all	427.7191217126136
human wisdom is summed up in two words:	457.84996819083244
“‘_Wait and hope_ (Fac et spera)!’”	441.8326618581909

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread	363.418038659249
public support and donations to carry out its mission of	411.7765681436166
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be	311.531919909121
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest	403.5403814965983
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations	340.561187918791

status with the IRS.	411.28425159222627
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating	342.0114203481863
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United	411.3112792721938
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	377.83834219872944
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	317.2501347758481
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations	439.85342369109327

AUTHOR’S PREFACE	496.0136070203116
In which it is proved that, notwithstanding their names’ ending in _os_	340.3162677417649
and _is_, the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor	460.4829316343037
to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them.	447.07904014716905
A short time ago, while making researches in the Royal Library for my	335.97083966648586
History of Louis XIV., I stumbled by chance upon the Memoirs of M.	461.03129693369976
d’Artagnan, printed—as were most of the works of that period, in which	467.311787905399
authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence, more	365.99310154426473
or less long, in the Bastille—at Amsterdam, by Pierre Rouge. The title	415.78962193597766
attracted me; I took them home with me, with the permission of the	460.13918588396007
guardian, and devoured them.	303.83383911697916
It is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious	498.6961032353354
work; and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as	449.4943745232797
appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein	480.0281385674139
find portraits penciled by the hand of a master; and although these	394.1911078699047
squibs may be, for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and	487.7128166978541
the walls of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII.,	346.09720292825494
Anne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of the period,	350.45669153758183
less faithful than in the history of M. Anquetil.	375.5541173124145
But, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is	427.576421032194
not always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring, as	449.906318506832
others doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate, our main	474.09127459987053
preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had	307.3775689906017
given a thought.	428.6184701125848
D’Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Tréville, captain	417.8347770836413
of the king’s Musketeers, he met in the antechamber three young men,	320.0684012360936
serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor	396.66739758465417
of being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.	436.70547074317255
We must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately	435.5599747198147
occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which D’Artagnan	349.77399224888234
had disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of	451.32020650993286
these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which,	316.516338351008
from caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the	351.69231830669145
simple Musketeer’s uniform.	465.37412018009894
From that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in	385.1126150946599
contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly	453.9611976313954
awakened our curiosity.	489.059751122439
The catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a	401.61260904562323
whole chapter, which, although it might be very instructive, would	437.0976409727956
certainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice,	393.2259932197259
then, to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many	374.45474921915263
fruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at	392.82073183178517
length found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin	345.6015115989264
Paris, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we do not	420.09699258925974
recollect which, having for title, “Memoirs of the Comte de la Fère,	400.21188965900444
Touching Some Events Which Passed in France Toward the End of the Reign	403.4564096529827
of King Louis XIII. and the Commencement of the Reign of King Louis	358.02332903082896
XIV.”	335.2812190973492
It may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over	352.6320261059997
this manuscript, our last hope, we found at the twentieth page the name	430.06479591582115
of Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of Porthos, and at the	393.2534556133642
thirty-first the name of Aramis.	488.1154844057877
The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which	316.087788062856
historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost	387.72389085761375
miraculous. We hastened, therefore, to obtain permission to print it,	451.8863751866543
with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others	420.45173004966114
at the doors of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, if we	468.583609895759
should not succeed—a very probable thing, by the by—in gaining	376.2022107309099
admission to the Académie Française with our own proper pack. This	373.473921396046
permission, we feel bound to say, was graciously granted; which compels	300.85039689514616
us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend	398.68064663169076
that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of	466.94762852707686
letters.	307.5128526409198
Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer	318.3281920376754
to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and	349.10312446138545
entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this	432.71411509520567
first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the	458.2687572970907
second immediately.	394.3634188965107
In the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we beg the	401.7304173813771
reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la Fère,	337.41722585236846
the pleasure or the _ennui_ he may experience.	314.55090524818405
This being understood, let us proceed with our history.	337.84904920045796
The Three Musketeers	337.4387907625763
Chapter I.	492.90678991353303
THE THREE PRESENTS OF D’ARTAGNAN THE ELDER	471.77198008552034
On the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of	402.8517682175718
Meung, in which the author of _Romance of the Rose_ was born, appeared	328.6364690693077
to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just	346.71883898547816
made a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying	488.60368991333286
toward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open	455.0952527115593
doors, hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat	424.23541126346197
uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps	308.2900854033053
toward the hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered,	498.98287061426873
increasing every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of	440.3813918185007
curiosity.	436.86160892014914
In those times panics were common, and few days passed without some	435.16642825882695
city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There	457.7832290103308
were nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who	319.55359946723627
made war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against	374.43228732739203
the king. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or	459.3577404941518
open wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and	414.58721417556467
scoundrels, who made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up	416.07250785679685
arms readily against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against	308.52350654886305
nobles or Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against the	369.0188924734013
cardinal or Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said	424.5338881235244
first Monday of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and	472.48814433251823
seeing neither the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de	319.6186207875551
Richelieu, rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived	366.86535870590336
there, the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.	424.3460782615166
A young man—we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a	368.44240661470957
Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without	419.978969282944
his coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a	468.0883380490842
woolen doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade	318.2583515283609
between lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high	463.8613734508499
cheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously	490.87862604549275
developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected,	324.7711890384548
even without his cap—and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort	307.04801300124296
of feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely	473.3687155268335
chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an	351.9383530380622
experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer’s son upon a journey	374.3730740392149
had it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a leather	467.62454379019306
baldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he walked, and against	490.5814622726953
the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.	393.9111208631284
For our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers.	348.6147310410168
It was a Béarn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his	450.2620217052381
hide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his	321.9277878508385
legs, which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering	334.7459233088509
a martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his	455.99339906741056
eight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so	310.0018461096943
well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable	475.4153516874243
gait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh,	328.8890924460157
the appearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung—which place he had	429.74484804186096
entered about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of	366.5353605009211
Beaugency—produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.	337.5635060583561
And this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young	380.01951525152924
D’Artagnan—for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante	395.24676198365853
named—from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous	345.19975352377656
appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He had	342.63842061053236
sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M.	480.5370247467157
d’Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth	490.01706566559443
at least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present	322.4783543436111
were above all price.	389.2994738957019
“My son,” said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure Béarn _patois_ of	495.0074992200014
which Henry IV. could never rid himself, “this horse was born in the	449.7750133132208
house of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it	466.65552334393453
ever since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to	334.6990372554023
die tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign	434.6676777760707
with it, take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At	444.05949141369126
court, provided you have ever the honor to go there,” continued M.	329.93117776146715
d’Artagnan the elder, “—an honor to which, remember, your ancient	407.248612563929
nobility gives you the right—sustain worthily your name of gentleman,	332.3449107645997
which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years,	382.43189479004906
both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you. By the	344.87724765959666
latter I mean your relatives and friends. Endure nothing from anyone	474.3539398471272
except Monsieur the Cardinal and the king. It is by his courage, please	320.762769689216
observe, by his courage alone, that a gentleman can make his way	446.4011518597803
nowadays. Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to	414.98291664274143
escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him. You are	442.1325017123695
young. You ought to be brave for two reasons: the first is that you are	342.85891200258914
a Gascon, and the second is that you are my son. Never fear quarrels,	368.5559737504877
but seek adventures. I have taught you how to handle a sword; you have	337.5942492173939
thews of iron, a wrist of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight the more	412.4383390409819
for duels being forbidden, since consequently there is twice as much	306.7194260074305
courage in fighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen	458.4351810181482
crowns, my horse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your mother	363.64587479241277
will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had from a	410.4764918019267
Bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that	352.23256657467226
do not reach the heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily and	368.3320452429985
long. I have but one word to add, and that is to propose an example to	490.12778020454317
you—not mine, for I myself have never appeared at court, and have only	337.74775989079666
taken part in religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de	359.1051374854452
Tréville, who was formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as	324.1457558279605
a child, the play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII., whom God preserve!	491.1976970375665
Sometimes their play degenerated into battles, and in these battles the	424.34529499451577
king was not always the stronger. The blows which he received increased	408.1042416369117
greatly his esteem and friendship for Monsieur de Tréville. Afterward,	370.9219175098187
Monsieur de Tréville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris,	326.1909781341644
five times; from the death of the late king till the young one came of	402.16137412269137
age, without reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date	403.9941016298875
up to the present day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of	476.7013237436622
edicts, ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the	397.7645349153498
Musketeers; that is to say, chief of a legion of Cæsars, whom the king	397.3399552598093
holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads—he who dreads	300.6801680086291
nothing, as it is said. Still further, Monsieur de Tréville gains ten	451.55438349047324
thousand crowns a year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you	301.8831970492431
begin. Go to him with this letter, and make him your model in order	448.47351242938157
that you may do as he has done.”	492.6822769933782
Upon which M. d’Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son,	440.1628540595385
kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.	438.0192425041987
On leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who	377.2024291985107
was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we	442.2533683823362
have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux	345.0814063007591
were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the	359.8699136713828
other—not that M. d’Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only	428.1861831280123
offspring, but M. d’Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it	423.18711810804166
unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. D’Artagnan	466.6518665992493
was a woman, and still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and—let us	400.24171312683006
speak it to the praise of M. d’Artagnan the younger—notwithstanding the	334.66825949453016
efforts he made to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature	337.7748782829359
prevailed, and he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great	419.074833081134
difficulty in concealing the half.	470.8586523973424
The same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with	320.81241334789445
the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen	305.97418126379046
crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Tréville—the counsels being	351.4530710331396
thrown into the bargain.	400.2842417524748
With such a _vade mecum_ D’Artagnan was morally and physically an exact	452.4228500408956
copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when	361.7761724493509
our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his	413.1683747240506
portrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies;	421.7495960198185
D’Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a	491.01618204424676
provocation—whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was	400.69248791953953
constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the	307.11967815832486
fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its	422.39380712088666
scabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite	399.39097019661745
numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the	399.3849144001514
side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over	421.3325810693176
this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these	498.4298668499297
passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over	445.93029606507537
prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of	326.2560659401003
the ancients. D’Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his	462.1083684136365
susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.	460.759649198661
But there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly	351.2666703968682
Miller, without anyone—host, waiter, or hostler—coming to hold his	307.6131824333947
stirrup or take his horse, D’Artagnan spied, though an open window on	487.9391464152269
the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although	491.49733071189604
of rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to	489.86437804298913
listen to him with respect. D’Artagnan fancied quite naturally,	388.0589304257446
according to his custom, that he must be the object of their	437.8519587355338
conversation, and listened. This time D’Artagnan was only in part	340.7438181670891
mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The	319.4032289743926
gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors;	458.5531319374596
and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for	424.9503279501848
the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a	458.4833799372952
half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man,	379.31014223782483
the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily	372.3609914086919
imagined.	409.6406316950709
Nevertheless, D’Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of	328.7195172798445
this impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye	471.8708985264953
upon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five	407.56779549613356
years of age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly	427.1325963996977
marked nose, and a black and well-shaped mustache. He was dressed in a	321.66805256141697
doublet and hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same	453.74950802203085
color, without any other ornaments than the customary slashes, through	341.5440452633823
which the shirt appeared. This doublet and hose, though new, were	400.75137210350476
creased, like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a	353.74664737504287
portmanteau. D’Artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a	310.3110700497566
most minute observer, and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that	439.87534439814607
this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future	367.57368308508615
life.	314.9255857193824
Now, as at the moment in which D’Artagnan fixed his eyes upon the	426.23412565041224
gentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most	422.9360454280983
knowing and profound remarks respecting the Béarnese pony, his two	340.933235513076
auditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though	340.4053940887839
contrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may be allowed to	422.90497305937424
use such an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there	406.03807864797807
could be no doubt; D’Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this	487.37061388828977
conviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to	356.4953528756826
copy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young	477.4527081485488
traveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword	440.4138513671676
and the other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his	431.2853786633213
anger increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty	385.28734533433084
speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing	360.83908430621966
at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied	481.67402917722325
with a furious gesture.	396.73521249225007
“I say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter—yes,	350.8000070706151
you, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh	407.7090653254036
together!”	317.9986780869215
The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as	475.80180681636966
if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that	462.4384226565799
such strange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not	454.07523557173215
possibly entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent,	476.6162356648615
and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described,	368.25511274053906
he replied to D’Artagnan, “I was not speaking to you, sir.”	478.66014629227453
“But I am speaking to you!” replied the young man, additionally	468.73574637645623
exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of	411.9821324373993
politeness and scorn.	383.6239118957918
The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring from	493.58940362885755
the window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed	441.1619020264056
himself before the horse, within two paces of D’Artagnan. His quiet	312.70397643148726
manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the	404.1230070383532
mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still	306.77471434724794
remained at the window.	441.6272954644073
D’Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the	324.85684930993347
scabbard.	385.5098104360427
“This horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a	477.8221047560785
buttercup,” resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun,	388.94970924940685
and addressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying	432.5287254056451
the least attention to the exasperation of D’Artagnan, who, however,	497.2244227024928
placed himself between him and them. “It is a color very well known in	344.3056581441987
botany, but till the present time very rare among horses.”	361.1796453573273
“There are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh	425.414360473969
at the master,” cried the young emulator of the furious Tréville.	478.20870060302536
“I do not often laugh, sir,” replied the stranger, “as you may perceive	390.2950409880284
by the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless I retain the	488.80065641879673
privilege of laughing when I please.”	416.68089919086503
“And I,” cried D’Artagnan, “will allow no man to laugh when it	377.05338558806284
displeases me!”	435.44153838777913
“Indeed, sir,” continued the stranger, more calm than ever; “well, that	325.25616322096965
is perfectly right!” and turning on his heel, was about to re-enter the	425.30528580000055
hostelry by the front gate, beneath which D’Artagnan on arriving had	415.91934177595533
observed a saddled horse.	464.91575407610196
But, D’Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him	433.4240075039447
thus who had the insolence to ridicule him. He drew his sword entirely	339.96353595463154
from the scabbard, and followed him, crying, “Turn, turn, Master Joker,	324.41328278691424
lest I strike you behind!”	315.4921584526458
“Strike me!” said the other, turning on his heels, and surveying the	418.1450004547718
young man with as much astonishment as contempt. “Why, my good fellow,	404.3431962077847
you must be mad!” Then, in a suppressed tone, as if speaking to	415.73422025273214
himself, “This is annoying,” continued he. “What a godsend this would	353.3743178954653
be for his Majesty, who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to	448.4323954800806
recruit for his Musketeers!”	307.9174709833144
He had scarcely finished, when D’Artagnan made such a furious lunge at	380.55549229352425
him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, it is probable he would	333.23224651734483
have jested for the last time. The stranger, then perceiving that the	365.86183195184515
matter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary, and	427.2122599451688
seriously placed himself on guard. But at the same moment, his two	493.85840274640645
auditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon D’Artagnan with sticks,	394.42490832932276
shovels and tongs. This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from	397.61691603135677
the attack that D’Artagnan’s adversary, while the latter turned round	436.5284322818783
to face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same	382.5543092734773
precision, and instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a	312.5979771467176
spectator of the fight—a part in which he acquitted himself with his	344.00092336293295
usual impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, “A plague upon these	301.7932540627112
Gascons! Replace him on his orange horse, and let him begone!”	379.43928606158664
“Not before I have killed you, poltroon!” cried D’Artagnan, making the	374.83204478592916
best face possible, and never retreating one step before his three	472.54368347692923
assailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.	349.92999909832986
“Another gasconade!” murmured the gentleman. “By my honor, these	321.7087883773198
Gascons are incorrigible! Keep up the dance, then, since he will have	415.956290529956
it so. When he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough	315.0043145875976
of it.”	497.51401504646054
But the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with;	369.47184301496327
D’Artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter. The fight was	315.6620771237238
therefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length D’Artagnan dropped	491.9549156205236
his sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.	464.87625822070197
Another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to	368.79896162882585
the ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.	330.5936283674323
It was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action	316.81384201472116
from all sides. The host, fearful of consequences, with the help of his	344.90825535222007
servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen, where some trifling	430.7463739539029
attentions were bestowed upon him.	309.3715623286903
As to the gentleman, he resumed his place at the window, and surveyed	333.0742048136066
the crowd with a certain impatience, evidently annoyed by their	494.77480304737344
remaining undispersed.	455.38120178842826
“Well, how is it with this madman?” exclaimed he, turning round as the	346.2826362491575
noise of the door announced the entrance of the host, who came in to	407.15430607749613
inquire if he was unhurt.	420.1243474101033
“Your Excellency is safe and sound?” asked the host.	428.80584444203043
“Oh, yes! Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know	497.1452757342603
what has become of our young man.”	477.4317435509346
“He is better,” said the host, “he fainted quite away.”	353.7951061749459
“Indeed!” said the gentleman.	484.73381166045635
“But before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you,	372.23018833460833
and to defy you while challenging you.”	495.12217956353356
“Why, this fellow must be the devil in person!” cried the stranger.	343.89087471939956
“Oh, no, your Excellency, he is not the devil,” replied the host, with	328.4291982699306
a grin of contempt; “for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and	486.5531955337279
found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns—which however, did	381.2940197199263
not prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had	414.2827400793231
happened in Paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later	401.03216953764894
period.”	360.1284273253067
“Then,” said the stranger coolly, “he must be some prince in disguise.”	480.7462910387469
“I have told you this, good sir,” resumed the host, “in order that you	369.9319520282399
may be on your guard.”	445.2753355465269
“Did he name no one in his passion?”	425.35391751548497
“Yes; he struck his pocket and said, ‘We shall see what Monsieur de	496.87297308807933
Tréville will think of this insult offered to his _protégé_.’”	343.60974070942467
“Monsieur de Tréville?” said the stranger, becoming attentive, “he put	450.5582477131878
his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of Monsieur de	339.72517054532454
Tréville? Now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you	463.0738994422301
did not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.	354.9081803834461
What was there in it?”	423.0619675096284
“A letter addressed to Monsieur de Tréville, captain of the	456.6105794957868
Musketeers.”	486.6008641381968
“Indeed!”	423.3651845646033
“Exactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency.”	362.2622899323301
The host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe	319.27841423548114
the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the	410.04365932598137
stranger. The latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill	419.39837447919246
of which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man	428.4302888737868
disquieted.	496.9200282841372
“The devil!” murmured he, between his teeth. “Can Tréville have set	365.67650480893707
this Gascon upon me? He is very young; but a sword thrust is a sword	490.603846501652
thrust, whatever be the age of him who gives it, and a youth is less to	371.67775944035986
be suspected than an older man,” and the stranger fell into a reverie	328.917883117056
which lasted some minutes. “A weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to	402.9386413955554
overthrow a great design.	307.6058539925605
“Host,” said he, “could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy	489.6189850747736
for me? In conscience, I cannot kill him; and yet,” added he, with a	361.8293374545898
coldly menacing expression, “he annoys me. Where is he?”	410.6295038924693
“In my wife’s chamber, on the first flight, where they are dressing his	471.4572920693199
wounds.”	396.2857690369143
“His things and his bag are with him? Has he taken off his doublet?”	324.51471420371524
“On the contrary, everything is in the kitchen. But if he annoys you,	321.6381749455398
this young fool—”	498.46290129183467
“To be sure he does. He causes a disturbance in your hostelry, which	441.96392767218106
respectable people cannot put up with. Go; make out my bill and notify	396.89060491142527
my servant.”	442.34970192883736
“What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?”	497.4344929955911
“You know that very well, as I gave my order to saddle my horse. Have	350.0173471097935
they not obeyed me?”	434.1660936329579
“It is done; as your Excellency may have observed, your horse is in the	474.18067762836984
great gateway, ready saddled for your departure.”	476.81533422181036
“That is well; do as I have directed you, then.”	479.4961037272136
“What the devil!” said the host to himself. “Can he be afraid of this	402.74353081919526
boy?” But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short; he	365.8071086156964
bowed humbly and retired.	381.1083980807849
“It is not necessary for Milady* to be seen by this fellow,” continued	495.85807257034276
the stranger. “She will soon pass; she is already late. I had better	324.0502477812694
get on horseback, and go and meet her. I should like, however, to know	386.29195885949014
what this letter addressed to Tréville contains.” And the stranger,	381.3193236657012
muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the kitchen.	464.56643194399817
* We are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly used when	495.00313937660087
followed by a family name. But we find it thus in the manuscript, and	422.1349728236388
we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it.	385.85634757680606
In the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the	301.99806475777683
presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry,	446.8354159996263
re-ascended to his wife’s chamber, and found D’Artagnan just recovering	314.1058683236555
his senses. Giving him to understand that the police would deal with	476.61760085495314
him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord—for	387.71740856108966
in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a	486.7550175776764
great lord—he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness D’Artagnan	349.1828071476414
should get up and depart as quickly as possible. D’Artagnan, half	403.8093819899088
stupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen	372.2901160459722
cloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs;	468.89247828144056
but on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his	301.9987851129909
antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two	389.9447068482183
large Norman horses.	447.8932738378044
His interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was	368.1558613374336
a woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We have already	354.4195140976073
observed with what rapidity D’Artagnan seized the expression of a	409.5599942032231
countenance. He perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young	490.24689197519547
and beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from	472.03972999858695
its being totally different from that of the southern countries in	385.3439657941334
which D’Artagnan had hitherto resided. She was pale and fair, with long	390.4358509681936
curls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue,	455.706913004374
languishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster. She was talking	426.8175152133267
with great animation with the stranger.	450.07416969919853
“His Eminence, then, orders me—” said the lady.	323.49219484615475
“To return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke	486.26329988559957
leaves London.”	401.66737621050544
“And as to my other instructions?” asked the fair traveler.	462.06903440742474
“They are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are	379.62257826134385
on the other side of the Channel.”	427.6807305710578
“Very well; and you—what will you do?”	321.0704091207548
“I—I return to Paris.”	350.66606797206714
“What, without chastising this insolent boy?” asked the lady.	385.12705071706745
The stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth,	379.49549963781783
D’Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold	471.3697998476977
of the door.	455.1975647942988
“This insolent boy chastises others,” cried he; “and I hope that this	377.9326191107708
time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before.”	413.37403596349935
“Will not escape him?” replied the stranger, knitting his brow.	483.3323334739981
“No; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?”	314.6227481918154
“Remember,” said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword,	414.12056057782354
“the least delay may ruin everything.”	361.78731797989025
“You are right,” cried the gentleman; “begone then, on your part, and I	344.24034734818946
will depart as quickly on mine.” And bowing to the lady, he sprang into	353.3380625605922
his saddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his	393.3915786811061
horses. The two interlocutors thus separated, taking opposite	352.7784995895256
directions, at full gallop.	409.951060639473
“Pay him, booby!” cried the stranger to his servant, without checking	456.15287900785506
the speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver	338.99825513565406
pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.	421.43124358428645
“Base coward! false gentleman!” cried D’Artagnan, springing forward, in	386.6650725275032
his turn, after the servant. But his wound had rendered him too weak to	330.5706323975317
support such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears	387.42347888653217
began to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed over	347.624659176103
his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still,	412.38988161867746
“Coward! coward! coward!”	438.0677412707481
“He is a coward, indeed,” grumbled the host, drawing near to	421.7578654122304
D’Artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters	301.2089557799811
with the young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had	390.52743834506316
despised the evening before.	389.1867045159107
“Yes, a base coward,” murmured D’Artagnan; “but she—she was very	498.76326171060407
beautiful.”	396.56387653544357
“What _she?_” demanded the host.	346.90885934840225
“Milady,” faltered D’Artagnan, and fainted a second time.	348.8413309701659
“Ah, it’s all one,” said the host; “I have lost two customers, but this	459.0949115566209
one remains, of whom I am pretty certain for some days to come. There	483.3342837449987
will be eleven crowns gained.”	311.30188156002134
It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that	340.02549587755726
remained in D’Artagnan’s purse.	493.38945100751596
The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day,	470.6840032658754
but he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five	496.9358962778467
o’clock D’Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help,	458.09892122643134
asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to	333.8917415178376
us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother’s	433.43049716429493
recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his	454.88803112673827
numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively	315.27312248622314
refusing the assistance of any doctor, D’Artagnan walked about that	339.8637462366587
same evening, and was almost cured by the morrow.	396.74969442363897
But when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine,	394.286875282241
the only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict	450.3465318828637
abstinence—while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of	305.8105158792443
the hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his	475.0677948668456
size could reasonably be supposed to have done—D’Artagnan found nothing	479.6501714411455
in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it	323.5213816982813
contained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Tréville, it had	388.61711160273353
disappeared.	425.3798449000269
The young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest	341.41833251950504
patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again,	323.84456417656514
rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his	454.2560956881298
purse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the	433.73383505451335
letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a	452.8258714170994
rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and	471.6453626217144
rosemary—for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and	473.44799725736044
threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were	349.4082984198992
not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the	426.1158735211685
servants the same sticks they had used the day before.	495.2554642252339
“My letter of recommendation!” cried D’Artagnan, “my letter of	375.593884599849
recommendation! or, the holy blood, I will spit you all like ortolans!”	485.2117136958799
Unfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful	393.91226096376306
obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have	386.70069966852395
related, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two,	421.94274210205134
and which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted when D’Artagnan	497.934980551395
proceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and	402.2525085921893
simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in	484.4524519234051
length, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. As to the	463.3988640851983
rest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make	374.65538952461895
himself a larding pin.	339.6090706387864
But this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man	324.42830366187735
if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made	330.0357442210046
was perfectly just.	308.0820923166398
“But, after all,” said he, lowering the point of his spit, “where is	306.22950439446254
this letter?”	461.2018364194115
“Yes, where is this letter?” cried D’Artagnan. “In the first place, I	386.6988722973564
warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Tréville, and it must be	479.45904000958893
found, or if it is not found, he will know how to find it.”	481.47777767371844
His threat completed the intimidation of the host. After the king and	349.1880050642232
the cardinal, M. de Tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most	451.01222080361725
frequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens. There was,	352.668021706182
to be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a	327.44986669649035
subdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence, as	393.1912524617098
the cardinal’s familiar was called.	483.035292857134
Throwing down his spit, and ordering his wife to do the same with her	385.58487030394105
broom handle, and the servants with their sticks, he set the first	449.9012074003943
example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter.	385.9291901868996
“Does the letter contain anything valuable?” demanded the host, after a	374.7424774780695
few minutes of useless investigation.	309.78492698969853
“Zounds! I think it does indeed!” cried the Gascon, who reckoned upon	475.0049582250391
this letter for making his way at court. “It contained my fortune!”	385.49125156637774
“Bills upon Spain?” asked the disturbed host.	390.19991571037804
“Bills upon his Majesty’s private treasury,” answered D’Artagnan, who,	319.1749474603109
reckoning upon entering into the king’s service in consequence of this	330.94255975106944
recommendation, believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply	480.2721906773242
without telling of a falsehood.	381.17846616519194
“The devil!” cried the host, at his wits’ end.	477.3170416171906
“But it’s of no importance,” continued D’Artagnan, with natural	327.08205935277357
assurance; “it’s of no importance. The money is nothing; that letter	437.3895141346642
was everything. I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have	445.7368565529523
lost it.” He would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand;	446.29231605865465
but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him.	329.0048490165962
A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was	495.5814266953737
giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.	473.4787452851101
“That letter is not lost!” cried he.	359.66046152500564
“What!” cried D’Artagnan.	427.51161839489845
“No, it has been stolen from you.”	418.48139152515745
“Stolen? By whom?”	318.2213977171551
“By the gentleman who was here yesterday. He came down into the	429.2666281741141
kitchen, where your doublet was. He remained there some time alone. I	301.11179699431233
would lay a wager he has stolen it.”	315.0859407511573
“Do you think so?” answered D’Artagnan, but little convinced, as he	450.84922167820355
knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this	315.7285121759488
letter was, and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity. The fact	482.21018981273966
was that none of his servants, none of the travelers present, could	385.7275666446362
have gained anything by being possessed of this paper.	410.04299681278144
“Do you say,” resumed D’Artagnan, “that you suspect that impertinent	344.07071488157914
gentleman?”	303.0171813332993
“I tell you I am sure of it,” continued the host. “When I informed him	388.1278469256509
that your lordship was the _protégé_ of Monsieur de Tréville, and that	409.12108484911613
you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman, he appeared to be	332.6330719593282
very much disturbed, and asked me where that letter was, and	373.0599463760461
immediately came down into the kitchen, where he knew your doublet	464.6302487100655
was.”	495.8160458402474
“Then that’s my thief,” replied D’Artagnan. “I will complain to	327.33026491243993
Monsieur de Tréville, and Monsieur de Tréville will complain to the	445.13078786169024
king.” He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave	437.81117194504014
them to the host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and	491.1587331236391
remounted his yellow horse, which bore him without any further accident	447.4447762863805
to the gate of St. Antoine at Paris, where his owner sold him for three	302.83542216748646
crowns, which was a very good price, considering that D’Artagnan had	405.8258605084691
ridden him hard during the last stage. Thus the dealer to whom	355.93680180889316
D’Artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young	314.04370464099776
man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the	392.31212259518173
originality of his color.	489.5633648305758
Thus D’Artagnan entered Paris on foot, carrying his little packet under	398.7067096715675
his arm, and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms	338.0385713992821
suited to the scantiness of his means. This chamber was a sort of	428.7123606797145
garret, situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, near the Luxembourg.	328.55038456317675
As soon as the earnest money was paid, D’Artagnan took possession of	469.2902189218772
his lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his	440.5389092709101
doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken	344.3837899866132
off an almost-new doublet of the elder M. d’Artagnan, and which she had	491.5616162970986
given her son secretly. Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a	475.0515748202937
new blade put to his sword, and then returned toward the Louvre,	462.9611423184683
inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel	443.88579466535913
of M. de Tréville, which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier;	317.6431702335707
that is to say, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by	390.05707312906725
D’Artagnan—a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for	358.41556358528453
the success of his journey.	336.2119853582481
After this, satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at	448.40860006576384
Meung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full	401.77496911405336
of hope for the future, he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the	482.2383131307953
brave.	458.0379894578025
This sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine o’clock in the	398.2077545524478
morning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence of	394.57214092782397
M. de Tréville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal	471.1513317426841
estimation.	450.8741683487856
Chapter II.	454.7942165969994
THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TRÉVILLE	477.61018877715617
M. de Troisville, as his family was still called in Gascony, or M. de	377.92410745913105
Tréville, as he has ended by styling himself in Paris, had really	433.5072761413329
commenced life as D’Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in	322.40776911074545
his pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence	354.77927343828304
which makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope	444.5298673016855
from the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan	377.4815402072683
gentleman derives in reality from his. His insolent bravery, his still	325.55978723758096
more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had	462.89936875117854
borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which	343.1912836925495
he had climbed four steps at a time.	313.9760927562535
He was the friend of the king, who honored highly, as everyone knows,	477.79203349921636
the memory of his father, Henry IV. The father of M. de Tréville had	445.8727887401632
served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default	376.3008217537844
of money—a thing to which the Béarnais was accustomed all his life, and	386.34252765698017
who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need	321.3914321068277
of borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit—in default of money, we	431.4906086409309
repeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of Paris, to assume for	305.97368564886244
his arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto _Fidelis et	405.39311901617833
fortis_. This was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little	370.09400053412276
in the way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the	349.36480807603346
great Henry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was	414.9320409788332
his sword and his motto. Thanks to this double gift and the spotless	361.6135882642616
name that accompanied it, M. de Tréville was admitted into the	430.35059756666215
household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword,	484.494573684242
and was so faithful to his motto, that Louis XIII., one of the good	338.5134876592562
blades of his kingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend	337.92804661858327
who was about to fight, he would advise him to choose as a second,	314.4916771850124
himself first, and Tréville next—or even, perhaps, before himself.	490.2576731037949
Thus Louis XIII. had a real liking for Tréville—a royal liking, a	426.53834350250247
self-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. At that unhappy	414.5373143530779
period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men	401.20592246055963
as Tréville. Many might take for their device the epithet _strong_,	366.3772776128602
which formed the second part of his motto, but very few gentlemen could	363.3943590290548
lay claim to the _faithful_, which constituted the first. Tréville was	455.7995513044343
one of these latter. His was one of those rare organizations, endowed	479.5544793388806
with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor,	440.5826982504997
a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given	343.8949048542638
to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to	405.60020574640055
strike this displeasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a	421.4864536666812
Poltiot de Méré, or a Vitry. In short, up to this period nothing had	317.73911522137547
been wanting to Tréville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch	406.2336389382872
for it, and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to	498.87256073631636
seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand.	356.80074259428324
At last Louis XIII. made Tréville the captain of his Musketeers, who	468.9598198349633
were to Louis XIII. in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his	411.5720868396618
Ordinaries had been to Henry III., and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI.	456.619876323978
On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When	377.7614407477122
he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII. had	433.92263407881103
surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France,	356.36365439032954
became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his	390.15901083593303
Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII. had his, and these two powerful	493.4700340870708
rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the	329.5805629496746
provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most	487.74880695098926
celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII.	363.61682262038585
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their	406.1828532687891
servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people.	476.36195426161584
While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them	395.41859234430524
secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine	364.32116239090766
regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn	453.51863005553395
this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these	303.45082826532786
defeats and in many of these victories.	448.11673562049646
Tréville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this	337.2591964382094
address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not	306.8577881272806
left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his	310.56719128680794
friendships. He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand	460.71614753170724
Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his	489.4778087846929
Eminence curl with ire. Tréville understood admirably the war method of	343.2359835312402
that period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy	351.87071943364265
must live at the expense of his compatriots. His soldiers formed a	455.78781648147026
legion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all	335.1953642868237
but himself.	370.91121954460783
Loose, half-drunk, imposing, the king’s Musketeers, or rather M. de	372.50970005428644
Tréville’s, spread themselves about in the cabarets, in the public	437.91549884419896
walks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting their mustaches,	299.48438125877414
clanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in annoying the Guards	365.5494177210764
of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them; then drawing in	323.4116269541803
the open streets, as if it were the best of all possible sports;	393.9514609910702
sometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged;	411.5863639177578
often killing others, but then certain of not rotting in prison, M. de	326.91819026632135
Tréville being there to claim them. Thus M. de Tréville was praised to	365.7854372100796
the highest note by these men, who adored him, and who, ruffians as	460.669420541523
they were, trembled before him like scholars before their master,	497.2688877303502
obedient to his least word, and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash	305.9574110885563
out the smallest insult.	391.80729365663296
M. de Tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king, in the first	474.14063888091596
place, and the friends of the king—and then for himself and his own	371.44067815309137
friends. For the rest, in the memoirs of this period, which has left so	385.62424996237274
many memoirs, one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by	317.6845781061804
his enemies; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among	463.57394658782175
men of the sword. In no instance, let us say, was this worthy gentleman	404.0145478733517
accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his	305.6077016844875
minions. Endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the	403.3174527505165
equal of the ablest intriguers, he remained an honest man. Still	347.2320859024344
further, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and painful exercises	397.5955034275663
which fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of	350.57157367205036
revels, one of the most insinuating lady’s men, one of the softest	305.5865716935521
whisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the _bonnes fortunes_ of	450.5880295299172
de Tréville were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been	403.43212328166294
talked of twenty years before, and that was not saying a little. The	384.06284102423996
captain of the Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and	434.1539717415361
this constitutes the zenith of human fortune.	319.9427252480038
Louis XIV. absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast	417.4211983508208
radiance; but his father, a sun _pluribus impar_, left his personal	437.0918437671095
splendor to each of his favorites, his individual value to each of his	441.6899227770492
courtiers. In addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal,	440.75717986976474
there might be reckoned in Paris at that time more than two hundred	463.00748013417655
smaller but still noteworthy levees. Among these two hundred levees,	310.36161585580743
that of Tréville was one of the most sought.	450.32882354777587
The court of his hôtel, situated in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier,	463.3888453942405
resembled a camp from by six o’clock in the morning in summer and eight	310.9401134858901
o’clock in winter. From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who appeared to	396.8638106903255
replace one another in order always to present an imposing number,	485.4522294746192
paraded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything. On one	303.07683417871345
of those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization would	480.7751241712584
build a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of	335.5489277169793
Paris, who ran after any sort of favor—gentlemen from the provinces	315.1327890344193
anxious to be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing	304.0338749156193
and carrying messages between their masters and M. de Tréville. In the	446.8664135772715
antechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is to	381.8513675692434
say, those who were called. In this apartment a continued buzzing	391.81610208929726
prevailed from morning till night, while M. de Tréville, in his office	339.49335230377835
contiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to	331.29255955130293
complaints, gave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the	377.69013131514646
Louvre, had only to place himself at the window to review both his men	317.3646957138117
and arms.	319.1248648361957
The day on which D’Artagnan presented himself the assemblage was	431.5976387612508
imposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving from his	436.4384353616364
province. It is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and that,	455.456446365945
particularly at this period, the compatriots of D’Artagnan had the	319.9618674589355
reputation of not being easily intimidated. When he had once passed the	393.40010840133345
massive door covered with long square-headed nails, he fell into the	447.97784861417
midst of a troop of swordsmen, who crossed one another in their	408.24989328808596
passage, calling out, quarreling, and playing tricks one with another.	477.46502176866665
In order to make one’s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves,	345.3857375332158
it was necessary to be an officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.	302.9779926626555
It was, then, into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young	404.37818647681115
man advanced with a beating heart, ranging his long rapier up his lanky	395.62532010129996
leg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap, with that half-smile	456.1129479934985
of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face. When he	489.8284479022834
had passed one group he began to breathe more freely; but he could not	394.41150212412447
help observing that they turned round to look at him, and for the first	459.383899092153
time in his life D’Artagnan, who had till that day entertained a very	353.08361200215705
good opinion of himself, felt ridiculous.	470.7149272171073
Arrived at the staircase, it was still worse. There were four	382.8827394096017
Musketeers on the bottom steps, amusing themselves with the following	389.277274221113
exercise, while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing	338.5904906217549
place to take their turn in the sport.	441.59365518168096
One of them, stationed upon the top stair, naked sword in hand,	455.4029026511113
prevented, or at least endeavored to prevent, the three others from	408.4176510671904
ascending.	430.6862489899827
These three others fenced against him with their agile swords.	482.4387926313407
D’Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils, and believed them to	424.87002154836773
be buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every	357.25258787670634
weapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each of these scratches	319.68468256679125
not only the spectators, but even the actors themselves, laughed like	366.7993590801483
so many madmen.	420.61803657298617
He who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries	414.26054160055725
marvelously in check. A circle was formed around them. The conditions	491.85704925919276
required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game,	489.4493907806558
yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him. In	326.147553795781
five minutes three were slightly wounded, one on the hand, another on	311.39322011618873
the ear, by the defender of the stair, who himself remained intact—a	378.6458339446924
piece of skill which was worth to him, according to the rules agreed	379.2616527507903
upon, three turns of favor.	408.95179588455755
However difficult it might be, or rather as he pretended it was, to	342.6970937277879
astonish our young traveler, this pastime really astonished him. He had	469.9436481529429
seen in his province—that land in which heads become so easily heated—a	422.7225394901444
few of the preliminaries of duels; but the daring of these four fencers	400.3165962679186
appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in Gascony. He	397.1328051989501
believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into	471.5646618338759
which Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened; and yet he had not	352.79374500495635
gained the goal, for there were still the landing place and the	376.2047326376495
antechamber.	485.0056871131736
On the landing they were no longer fighting, but amused themselves with	368.9340968762253
stories about women, and in the antechamber, with stories about the	434.31252067609194
court. On the landing D’Artagnan blushed; in the antechamber he	463.9105491658514
trembled. His warm and fickle imagination, which in Gascony had	326.5069088521049
rendered him formidable to young chambermaids, and even sometimes their	487.9580331499245
mistresses, had never dreamed, even in moments of delirium, of half the	366.54950714089944
amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here	362.6219457589135
set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the	404.17634214462396
least concealed. But if his morals were shocked on the landing, his	404.29550165518185
respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber. There, to	314.7100888568902
his great astonishment, D’Artagnan heard the policy which made all	342.2483894246331
Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly, as well as the private life	407.1189681954169
of the cardinal, which so many great nobles had been punished for	447.51319394745383
trying to pry into. That great man who was so revered by D’Artagnan the	301.39032052513517
elder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tréville,	390.7912143641188
who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back. Some	344.4019748744317
sang ballads about Mme. d’Aguillon, his mistress, and Mme. Cambalet,	323.9814662116499
his niece; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and	492.43379721061694
guards of the cardinal duke—all things which appeared to D’Artagnan	407.5173165321245
monstrous impossibilities.	434.9150995031388
Nevertheless, when the name of the king was now and then uttered	338.5416312567513
unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of gag seemed to	423.3247927656088
close for a moment on all these jeering mouths. They looked	328.35523626800534
hesitatingly around them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of the	461.07373928087327
partition between them and the office of M. de Tréville; but a fresh	399.0622706814076
allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then	434.20823229272787
the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from	447.3785724481706
any of his actions.	327.36738998836853
“Certes, these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged,”	363.712908763337
thought the terrified D’Artagnan, “and I, no doubt, with them; for from	346.40046618124427
the moment I have either listened to or heard them, I shall be held as	337.184612544936
an accomplice. What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed	367.3842640606726
out to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the	496.16289207704324
society of such pagans?”	327.90985884359543
We have no need, therefore, to say that D’Artagnan dared not join in	458.465652552969
the conversation, only he looked with all his eyes and listened with	421.0535902688654
all his ears, stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing; and	363.7697921634409
despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions, he felt himself	452.6276453696589
carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to	361.56299734475596
blame the unheard-of things which were taking place.	473.17106056822024
Although he was a perfect stranger in the court of M. de Tréville’s	418.08342034412453
courtiers, and this his first appearance in that place, he was at	471.83367533064074
length noticed, and somebody came and asked him what he wanted. At this	388.60916812673764
demand D’Artagnan gave his name very modestly, emphasized the title of	433.3036159370252
compatriot, and begged the servant who had put the question to him to	367.4033262084213
request a moment’s audience of M. de Tréville—a request which the	359.6025434112953
other, with an air of protection, promised to transmit in due season.	318.1416088324009
D’Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure	315.9991235422519
to study costumes and physiognomy.	330.2824159662846
The center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height	396.92381388351384
and haughty countenance, dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract	316.4096982530412
general attention. He did not wear the uniform cloak—which was not	488.3671660757255
obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence—but a	470.75501587407064
cerulean-blue doublet, a little faded and worn, and over this a	301.13581197000207
magnificent baldric, worked in gold, which shone like water ripples in	471.24734305299984
the sun. A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his	452.4600271096672
shoulders, disclosing in front the splendid baldric, from which was	338.5082738255061
suspended a gigantic rapier. This Musketeer had just come off guard,	463.51546177361047
complained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.	438.04710999087524
It was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that he had put	400.74173258862913
on his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his	440.26608008817857
mustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, and	474.8983266837828
D’Artagnan more than anyone.	391.0485327573243
“What would you have?” said the Musketeer. “This fashion is coming in.	336.4320786459952
It is a folly, I admit, but still it is the fashion. Besides, one must	352.22621614314056
lay out one’s inheritance somehow.”	353.64957753532326
“Ah, Porthos!” cried one of his companions, “don’t try to make us	312.12294011627836
believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity. It was given	300.3948403162206
to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday, near the	383.7040608810875
gate St. Honoré.”	478.53899401336525
“No, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, I bought it with the	355.63592502491645
contents of my own purse,” answered he whom they designated by the name	302.10501544348534
Porthos.	409.6167880769212
“Yes; about in the same manner,” said another Musketeer, “that I bought	334.59106530185966
this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one.”	434.3048899041652
“It’s true, though,” said Porthos; “and the proof is that I paid twelve	376.6931401513168
pistoles for it.”	304.17051780359293
The wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.	360.55525246892694
“Is it not true, Aramis?” said Porthos, turning toward another	427.7342229137728
Musketeer.	334.6698964437864
This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who	448.06833192141875
had just designated him by the name of Aramis. He was a stout man, of	410.16174233349614
about two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance, a	323.91693584769075
black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. His	449.71435565307456
delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;	346.4615624142539
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,	324.1163554747168
and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their	391.79249223469265
delicate pink transparency. Habitually he spoke little and slowly,	329.1204759114418
bowed frequently, laughed without noise, showing his teeth, which were	318.909368779764
fine and of which, as the rest of his person, he appeared to take great	310.4399174129988
care. He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the	331.56614664490434
head.	369.83819478771363
This affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the	385.56821262824457
baldric. They continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and	402.00600354988984
with a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to	413.1816178079727
another subject.	300.6021924885543
“What do you think of the story Chalais’s esquire relates?” asked	413.23436192340864
another Musketeer, without addressing anyone in particular, but on the	429.5707237577933
contrary speaking to everybody.	405.42808721097333
“And what does he say?” asked Porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.	345.3787728903746
“He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort, the _âme damnée_ of the	361.41152179951865
cardinal disguised as a Capuchin, and that this cursed Rochefort,	442.87752416335405
thanks to his disguise, had tricked Monsieur de Laigues, like a ninny	383.55444059299936
as he is.”	331.20169046353107
“A ninny, indeed!” said Porthos; “but is the matter certain?”	355.5489098344605
“I had it from Aramis,” replied the Musketeer.	301.676938040193
“Indeed?”	403.41099342683196
“Why, you knew it, Porthos,” said Aramis. “I told you of it yesterday.	343.5689093979044
Let us say no more about it.”	388.96207911579006
“Say no more about it? That’s _your_ opinion!” replied Porthos.	445.01195534255976
“Say no more about it! _Peste!_ You come to your conclusions quickly.	357.6152649044042
What! The cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen	310.10887052288314
from him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal—has, with the help	350.1217524037427
of this spy and thanks to this correspondence, Chalais’s throat cut,	454.1526984464043
under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry	415.26410939192715
Monsieur to the queen! Nobody knew a word of this enigma. You unraveled	338.0781389937748
it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and while we are still	311.1664826625665
gaping with wonder at the news, you come and tell us today, ‘Let us say	496.80232780457
no more about it.’”	424.2283670458542
“Well, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it,” replied	348.41263638529267
Aramis, patiently.	381.3346487500728
“This Rochefort,” cried Porthos, “if I were the esquire of poor	420.1021123935206
Chalais, should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me.”	323.2515344720875
“And you—you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the Red Duke,”	486.8770334848472
replied Aramis.	361.4005071752528
“Oh, the Red Duke! Bravo! Bravo! The Red Duke!” cried Porthos, clapping	323.41875185032643
his hands and nodding his head. “The Red Duke is capital. I’ll	412.1752215640207
circulate that saying, be assured, my dear fellow. Who says this Aramis	423.98287658544893
is not a wit? What a misfortune it is you did not follow your first	473.08173290524314
vocation; what a delicious abbé you would have made!”	474.2923664510251
“Oh, it’s only a temporary postponement,” replied Aramis; “I shall be	431.41212684915683
one someday. You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study	475.575356793509
theology for that purpose.”	409.7063235909271
“He will be one, as he says,” cried Porthos; “he will be one, sooner or	318.1639907868585
later.”	399.50791311155706
“Sooner,” said Aramis.	476.7602648987987
“He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock,	432.25759430205164
which hangs behind his uniform,” said another Musketeer.	411.32560179074596
“What is he waiting for?” asked another.	307.94970877564015
“Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.”	409.1261393176495
“No jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,” said Porthos; “thank God the	429.32045436167374
queen is still of an age to give one!”	313.64596258762595
“They say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,” replied Aramis,	301.9196797197919
with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so	376.3759730570133
simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.	365.8438480274653
“Aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,” interrupted Porthos.	390.0314612729902
“Your wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if Monsieur de Tréville	398.1863638862958
heard you, you would repent of speaking thus.”	306.57483537487155
“Are you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?” cried Aramis, from whose	398.3276767947585
usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.	481.6542363255265
“My dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abbé. Be one or the other, but	480.1165274077152
not both,” replied Porthos. “You know what Athos told you the other	381.83130691735937
day; you eat at everybody’s mess. Ah, don’t be angry, I beg of you,	380.3804218062593
that would be useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, Athos	498.5246249553319
and me. You go to Madame d’Aguillon’s, and you pay your court to her;	433.3441454712057
you go to Madame de Bois-Tracy’s, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse,	320.53815527108304
and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady.	480.8446032238393
Oh, good Lord! Don’t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one	314.80201177042676
asks for your secret—all the world knows your discretion. But since you	338.1924281198225
possess that virtue, why the devil don’t you make use of it with	470.0556837890628
respect to her Majesty? Let whoever likes talk of the king and the	406.21041743581713
cardinal, and how he likes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone	482.89411396325056
speaks of her, let it be respectfully.”	459.67953508745353
“Porthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly tell you so,” replied	358.5334699964833
Aramis. “You know I hate moralizing, except when it is done by Athos.	434.26009043491626
As to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on	387.14590424098446
that head. I will be an abbé if it suits me. In the meanwhile I am a	470.40829172863744
Musketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and at this moment it	380.1109415423811
pleases me to say that you weary me.”	378.5657524417381
“Aramis!”	447.06019728779916
“Porthos!”	389.4809788184804
“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” cried the surrounding group.	383.8673025699244
“Monsieur de Tréville awaits Monsieur d’Artagnan,” cried a servant,	399.03918918964087
throwing open the door of the cabinet.	488.59288921916993
At this announcement, during which the door remained open, everyone	386.785922939005
became mute, and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of	377.392174946439
the length of the antechamber, and entered the apartment of the captain	357.8230941332117
of the Musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having	390.6509798002227
so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel.	470.57381097176403
Chapter III.	453.23116491725045
THE AUDIENCE	482.1004351247809
M. de Tréville was at the moment in rather ill-humor, nevertheless he	495.6452371569254
saluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground; and he	421.3368920368612
smiled on receiving D’Artagnan’s response, the Béarnese accent of which	483.59647049799946
recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country—a double	480.51587534402097
remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward	388.6923107032039
the antechamber and making a sign to D’Artagnan with his hand, as if to	406.8369819225877
ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he	497.77263506117004
called three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran	438.8470818840524
through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the	350.856101552789
angry accent.	480.31515452965755
“Athos! Porthos! Aramis!”	431.71110232999604
The two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who	407.72398657984314
answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the	459.8143547608537
group of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet,	323.89614355823
the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their	345.8675345347952
appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its	350.69583015624954
carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of	314.1712699233844
D’Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader	332.46326515625447
an Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders.	483.2341010460287
When the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind	432.3128582312406
them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons	387.0359093001199
which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had	301.3620512104378
recommenced; when M. de Tréville had three or four times paced in	314.6392453892621
silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet,	339.5427480243752
passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and	401.56269132670457
silent as if on parade—he stopped all at once full in front of them,	319.5928634058528
and covering them from head to foot with an angry look, “Do you know	477.29879541492977
what the king said to me,” cried he, “and that no longer ago than	370.47022658713047
yesterday evening—do you know, gentlemen?”	358.76742718501424
“No,” replied the two Musketeers, after a moment’s silence, “no, sir,	372.7962259463885
we do not.”	428.3480796979752
“But I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us,” added Aramis, in	452.30042817670403
his politest tone and with his most graceful bow.	310.27631995158066
“He told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among	308.5633272225709
the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.”	394.8057901782656
“The Guards of the cardinal! And why so?” asked Porthos, warmly.	321.3094655574495
“Because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of	328.9262823476678
being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.”	389.42927378461735
* A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.	460.03060917139317
The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D’Artagnan did	456.80588273871854
not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.	358.81338258838775
“Yes, yes,” continued M. de Tréville, growing warmer as he spoke, “and	445.6698274818459
his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the	428.9909711072778
Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related	465.766190148111
yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very	413.1194259806902
displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those _damned	412.6386419211036
Musketeers_, those _daredevils_—he dwelt upon those words with an	468.56794586384575
ironical tone still more displeasing to me—those _braggarts_, added he,	341.1368348247298
glancing at me with his tiger-cat’s eye, had made a riot in the Rue	488.23888779909896
Férou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was	461.09149162268886
going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters!	383.6398424885509
_Morbleu!_ You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You	446.5995815515606
were among them—you were! Don’t deny it; you were recognized, and the	440.08530298051625
cardinal named you. But it’s all my fault; yes, it’s all my fault,	404.36548942504396
because it is myself who selects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did	495.71636636352775
you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a	430.3194038409474
cassock? And you, Porthos, do you only wear such a fine golden baldric	449.0222117746804
to suspend a sword of straw from it? And Athos—I don’t see Athos. Where	330.2434110016431
is he?”	476.22492927518465
“Ill—”	401.52292020270784
“Very ill, say you? And of what malady?”	367.26404665812595
“It is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir,” replied Porthos,	376.9264946818999
desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; “and what is serious	451.5440628019114
is that it will certainly spoil his face.”	454.53789080589877
“The smallpox! That’s a great story to tell me, Porthos! Sick of the	390.13551274937885
smallpox at his age! No, no; but wounded without doubt, killed,	348.92316312571563
perhaps. Ah, if I knew! S’blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have	464.2676616041417
this haunting of bad places, this quarreling in the streets, this	402.7326670303324
swordplay at the crossways; and above all, I will not have occasion	423.77181779182
given for the cardinal’s Guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who	413.9456500151213
never put themselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides,	324.8838301385934
never allow themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I am sure of	418.6288333941229
it—they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back	366.4988904750769
a step. To save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee—that is good for	337.30460056971026
the king’s Musketeers!”	497.10477603353377
Porthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could willingly have	439.8802158769097
strangled M. de Tréville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not	350.45033939511205
felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. They	331.25957061387413
stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the	369.4271875551601
blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.	361.2750345896707
All without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis	495.7486572218417
called, and had guessed, from M. de Tréville’s tone of voice, that he	303.49255558986766
was very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued to the	390.64694095035327
tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to	304.4037750032679
the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths	459.7267992534139
repeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all	383.12072992326716
the people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the	481.8480707747077
cabinet to the street gate, the whole hôtel was boiling.	400.1973905495083
“Ah! The king’s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal,	376.39928741851156
are they?” continued M. de Tréville, as furious at heart as his	415.0545019814369
soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so	393.90284938049604
to say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his	430.58600433864655
auditors. “What! Six of his Eminence’s Guards arrest six of his	312.18808989618066
Majesty’s Musketeers! _Morbleu!_ My part is taken! I will go straight	309.4106943025081
to the Louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king’s	378.1416009397693
Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal’s Guards, and if he	310.68317897929865
refuses me, _morbleu!_ I will turn abbé.”	455.51408173992456
At these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to	453.9478541227603
be heard but oaths and blasphemies. The _morbleus_, the _sang Dieus_,	305.06701511939207
the _morts touts les diables_, crossed one another in the air.	302.57606293662894
D’Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself,	352.47049991808694
and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table.	387.1756719944712
“Well, my Captain,” said Porthos, quite beside himself, “the truth is	491.95490552000854
that we were six against six. But we were not captured by fair means;	475.811587707093
and before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,	394.08168600744375
and Athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. For you know	307.86448919730105
Athos. Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again	414.70829813407056
twice. And we did not surrender—no! They dragged us away by force. On	385.69294536102143
the way we escaped. As for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and	383.74920398990844
left him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the	406.52438520567864
trouble to carry him away. That’s the whole story. What the devil,	445.10917171088823
Captain, one cannot win all one’s battles! The great Pompey lost that	496.1160298677843
of Pharsalia; and Francis the First, who was, as I have heard say, as	486.3892894730631
good as other folks, nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia.”	347.2310354793649
“And I have the honor of assuring you that I killed one of them with	387.3279564682602
his own sword,” said Aramis; “for mine was broken at the first parry.	399.6334854797227
Killed him, or poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you.”	460.7563551726656
“I did not know that,” replied M. de Tréville, in a somewhat softened	473.3195355548223
tone. “The cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive.”	362.2854138100236
“But pray, sir,” continued Aramis, who, seeing his captain become	401.70207427242514
appeased, ventured to risk a prayer, “do not say that Athos is wounded.	363.42531499688744
He would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and	406.03516859579287
as the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder	391.2898993528689
it penetrates into the chest, it is to be feared—”	350.20223010599045
At this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head,	301.4947897791678
but frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.	376.57574414477165
“Athos!” cried the two Musketeers.	426.23093001615933
“Athos!” repeated M. de Tréville himself.	429.97779216508246
“You have sent for me, sir,” said Athos to M. de Tréville, in a feeble	441.74650798001267
yet perfectly calm voice, “you have sent for me, as my comrades inform	485.4926788353685
me, and I have hastened to receive your orders. I am here; what do you	399.20659739444403
want with me?”	461.3261232726487
And at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as	412.92524537580744
usual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. M. de Tréville,	486.34035008203284
moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang	304.61557572927734
toward him.	476.47980052355973
“I was about to say to these gentlemen,” added he, “that I forbid my	383.19076946319353
Musketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very	319.0176389038617
dear to the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the	332.34650787569046
bravest on the earth. Your hand, Athos!”	362.6885477921416
And without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of	380.8605223521614
affection, M. de Tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all	325.29019628395173
his might, without perceiving that Athos, whatever might be his	397.1944220345696
self-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if	361.49898560068505
possible, grew paler than he was before.	381.2676769110402
The door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by	317.1204399334969
the arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known	432.22893327189297
to all. A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain;	356.64045745117954
and two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,	480.4681522415163
appeared through the openings of the tapestry. M. de Tréville was about	304.8418006908617
to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the	376.9589541969619
hand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against	486.16966255589955
pain, at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.	358.2389259709628
“A surgeon!” cried M. de Tréville, “mine! The king’s! The best! A	311.70442336667696
surgeon! Or, s’blood, my brave Athos will die!”	371.6685239061518
At the cries of M. de Tréville, the whole assemblage rushed into the	302.38914095785464
cabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all	451.748330545952
crowded round the wounded man. But all this eager attention might have	326.3947280714575
been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be	463.0396953308583
in the hôtel. He pushed through the crowd, approached Athos, still	311.04173452465
insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him	473.1398561965301
greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the	346.2739846663421
Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M.	456.2126357234226
de Tréville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore	316.62845249317917
their comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and	390.16025186121436
behind the surgeon the door closed.	479.796157511298
The cabinet of M. de Tréville, generally held so sacred, became in an	447.90627749858857
instant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and	371.3379584065271
vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his	354.0152627859007
Guards to all the devils.	373.09467196804115
An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de	442.1432147191581
Tréville alone remaining with the wounded.	371.92015949003394
At length, M. de Tréville himself returned. The injured man had	356.95221868302934
recovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the	362.2701683711713
Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness	494.682378202932
having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood.	391.20578711077184
Then M. de Tréville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except	353.8206552320487
D’Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the	487.82760977795925
tenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.	423.7155289194782
When all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Tréville, on	391.9783992132691
turning round, found himself alone with the young man. The event which	327.69026163504185
had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas. He	305.41054124483395
inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor. D’Artagnan then	470.94281420386824
repeated his name, and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of	467.0444918489983
the present and the past, M. de Tréville grasped the situation.	431.3609743485499
“Pardon me,” said he, smiling, “pardon me my dear compatriot, but I had	308.49849575052957
wholly forgotten you. But what help is there for it! A captain is	348.5172292020343
nothing but a father of a family, charged with even a greater	327.8997534007311
responsibility than the father of an ordinary family. Soldiers are big	446.01489396970834
children; but as I maintain that the orders of the king, and more	318.72644209345253
particularly the orders of the cardinal, should be executed—”	454.33535965376234
D’Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile M. de Tréville	498.51524642456314
judged that he had not to deal with a fool, and changing the	402.7909042551525
conversation, came straight to the point.	450.3587162332234
“I respected your father very much,” said he. “What can I do for the	351.72741413312394
son? Tell me quickly; my time is not my own.”	443.7166890410835
“Monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, “on quitting Tarbes and coming hither, it	454.3857022115305
was my intention to request of you, in remembrance of the friendship	464.70927256104744
which you have not forgotten, the uniform of a Musketeer; but after all	418.3957809899597
that I have seen during the last two hours, I comprehend that such a	457.87812716959047
favor is enormous, and tremble lest I should not merit it.”	423.63883549851334
“It is indeed a favor, young man,” replied M. de Tréville, “but it may	426.24857512742074
not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear	332.1752032392498
to believe. But his majesty’s decision is always necessary; and I	350.37639943294823
inform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the	422.7446811627973
preliminary ordeal of several campaigns, certain brilliant actions, or	493.36226611784684
a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours.”	495.8095021475418
D’Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the	324.1361554603926
Musketeer’s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which	322.0015888387084
preceded the attainment of it.	375.7321733449456
“But,” continued M. de Tréville, fixing upon his compatriot a look so	332.7603200165499
piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his	361.5138689791372
heart, “on account of my old companion, your father, as I have said, I	471.6982924576072
will do something for you, young man. Our recruits from Béarn are not	440.1752797131179
generally very rich, and I have no reason to think matters have much	345.76264725856356
changed in this respect since I left the province. I dare say you have	440.78210682626826
not brought too large a stock of money with you?”	477.9783727306468
D’Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, “I ask	338.3910204501885
alms of no man.”	337.57662774789117
“Oh, that’s very well, young man,” continued M. de Tréville, “that’s	442.8007126251016
all very well. I know these airs; I myself came to Paris with four	332.72511925786125
crowns in my purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell	321.2829788200093
me I was not in a condition to purchase the Louvre.”	395.6557035722272
D’Artagnan’s bearing became still more imposing. Thanks to the sale of	378.6112645138043
his horse, he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de	466.6230060049287
Tréville possessed at the commencement of his.	437.14242587601655
“You ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large	401.26992948421986
the sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in	457.3379789511446
the exercises becoming a gentleman. I will write a letter today to the	490.726097460874
Director of the Royal Academy, and tomorrow he will admit you without	308.5615015661321
any expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little service. Our	346.52080414642387
best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able	321.7174462491815
to obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, swordsmanship in all its	371.81750826505805
branches, and dancing. You will make some desirable acquaintances; and	468.3286551640416
from time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are	347.3564154686599
getting on, and to say whether I can be of further service to you.”	469.62044968962243
D’Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not	471.39439357758897
but perceive a little coldness in this reception.	428.1537517285847
“Alas, sir,” said he, “I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the	319.33579748137043
letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.”	497.6908393500619
“I certainly am surprised,” replied M. de Tréville, “that you should	320.6396987101803
undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole	373.1950023784306
resource of us poor Béarnese.”	379.0630729586224
“I had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,” cried	306.5497279877188
D’Artagnan; “but it was perfidiously stolen from me.”	470.31267773052014
He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman	439.68775826215335
with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness	335.206970450796
that delighted M. de Tréville.	335.532033303074
“This is all very strange,” said M. de Tréville, after meditating a	342.5990808491856
minute; “you mentioned my name, then, aloud?”	405.5758161689723
“Yes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have	455.5579623525313
done otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.	383.9813374588663
Judge if I should not put myself under its protection.”	379.7220055639725
Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Tréville loved	305.0469593235343
incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain	482.9192401038314
from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared,	473.0472602955954
and returning to the adventure of Meung, “Tell me,” continued he, “had	447.66281037076027
not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?”	361.3059469070873
“Yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.”	410.867680669564
“Was he not a fine-looking man?”	450.87054797594953
“Yes.”	348.3917367224198
“Of lofty stature.”	362.13248590491634
“Yes.”	396.57514353603017
“Of pale complexion and brown hair?”	352.00942267027926
“Yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with	407.66663401336126
this man? If I ever find him again—and I will find him, I swear, were	313.4615375277501
it in hell!”	460.38267006355323
“He was waiting for a woman,” continued Tréville.	400.81655864568995
“He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her	300.71602477704715
whom he awaited.”	405.02209262658516
“You know not the subject of their conversation?”	385.4815100696603
“He gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London.”	401.5129639500419
“Was this woman English?”	409.45432412307343
“He called her Milady.”	488.7515726604575
“It is he; it must be he!” murmured Tréville. “I believed him still at	415.00630629906584
Brussels.”	498.7737572844864
“Oh, sir, if you know who this man is,” cried D’Artagnan, “tell me who	311.0045397420844
he is, and whence he is. I will then release you from all your	353.73846882016784
promises—even that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers; for	334.47551967305037
before everything, I wish to avenge myself.”	299.4364551195534
“Beware, young man!” cried Tréville. “If you see him coming on one side	405.9004674769617
of the street, pass by on the other. Do not cast yourself against such	409.7047582127048
a rock; he would break you like glass.”	316.8422559840542
“That will not prevent me,” replied D’Artagnan, “if ever I find him.”	338.2966081044647
“In the meantime,” said Tréville, “seek him not—if I have a right to	358.9462533636811
advise you.”	431.75232493748484
All at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.	480.8370555106823
This great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for	368.20931795496847
this man, who—a rather improbable thing—had stolen his father’s letter	330.95223494549396
from him—was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred? Might	358.27417019358217
not this young man be sent by his Eminence? Might he not have come for	489.1859503933816
the purpose of laying a snare for him? This pretended D’Artagnan—was he	351.9813032406944
not an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce	399.1422489141263
into Tréville’s house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and	366.252210037442
afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances?	359.8765313028979
He fixed his eyes upon D’Artagnan even more earnestly than before. He	356.0826792045889
was moderately reassured, however, by the aspect of that countenance,	346.1713895949693
full of astute intelligence and affected humility. “I know he is a	432.31002002104316
Gascon,” reflected he, “but he may be one for the cardinal as well as	313.39911820701576
for me. Let us try him.”	458.2674953969174
“My friend,” said he, slowly, “I wish, as the son of an ancient	468.49424246975775
friend—for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true—I	397.23583688104475
wish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in	430.88380498036645
my reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy. The	409.810288755593
king and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent	398.0073588112159
bickerings are only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a	443.5821061004473
compatriot, a handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his	329.48528734394216
way, should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the	462.5760204812926
snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it.	391.0022891913172
Be assured that I am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and	329.9748626415259
that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the	354.922369975884
king, and also the cardinal—one of the most illustrious geniuses that	476.564238773268
France has ever produced.	329.1357862328154
“Now, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you	305.97147158817705
entertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your	419.1873154414208
instincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out	455.4159945057086
against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you	361.57553855552334
in many ways, but without attaching you to my person. I hope that my	366.6962305067624
frankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young	347.8831693639827
man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to you.”	311.3484455698438
Tréville said to himself: “If the cardinal has set this young fox upon	407.6994879272812
me, he will certainly not have failed—he, who knows how bitterly I	456.4340283153906
execrate him—to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to	359.24674378262785
me is to rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if	383.62298170058244
it be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his	392.36945463890834
Eminence in horror.”	377.8964514345422
It, however, proved otherwise. D’Artagnan answered, with the greatest	410.14100903081544
simplicity: “I came to Paris with exactly such intentions. My father	309.8444573302532
advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and	348.5145863571599
yourself—whom he considered the first three personages in France.”	308.3449557681121
D’Artagnan added M. de Tréville to the others, as may be perceived; but	345.75699023352763
he thought this addition would do no harm.	359.12090985237717
“I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,” continued he, “and	355.32996018169126
the most profound respect for his actions. So much the better for me,	354.7531314550224
sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness—for then you will	498.2364283043064
do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you	395.1227577826136
have entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am	474.6560423466713
ruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still trust you will not	364.81644533694146
esteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.”	365.52322692446967
M. de Tréville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much	322.01002646730257
penetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not	414.08277985891385
entirely remove his suspicions. The more this young man was superior to	346.4742945708706
others, the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him.	487.8959100894592
Nevertheless, he pressed D’Artagnan’s hand, and said to him: “You are	344.1348217995384
an honest youth; but at the present moment I can only do for you that	425.15845943316066
which I just now offered. My hôtel will be always open to you.	363.32549543222194
Hereafter, being able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently to	459.1024714652708
take advantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that	425.59339282004527
which you desire.”	360.4553120230827
“That is to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “that you will wait until I have	408.81618364021546
proved myself worthy of it. Well, be assured,” added he, with the	478.5454619593367
familiarity of a Gascon, “you shall not wait long.” And he bowed in	340.3653704230172
order to retire, and as if he considered the future in his own hands.	327.9714262319105
“But wait a minute,” said M. de Tréville, stopping him. “I promised you	446.93326727794226
a letter for the director of the Academy. Are you too proud to accept	498.2821963694016
it, young gentleman?”	302.2634673171555
“No, sir,” said D’Artagnan; “and I will guard it so carefully that I	370.87083946106804
will be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who	409.221146418385
shall attempt to take it from me!”	430.47746704387043
M. de Tréville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man	396.3898208268861
compatriot in the embrasure of the window, where they had talked	378.4590642918844
together, he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised	392.4019773524077
letter of recommendation. While he was doing this, D’Artagnan, having	463.7314951150248
no better employment, amused himself with beating a march upon the	316.7338558660141
window and with looking at the Musketeers, who went away, one after	486.290359747667
another, following them with his eyes until they disappeared.	307.3989344200997
M. de Tréville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising,	349.490365643578
approached the young man in order to give it to him. But at the very	445.0789576099446
moment when D’Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de	309.2899400963415
Tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden	457.34987843505303
spring, become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying,	498.28074541804574
“S’blood, he shall not escape me this time!”	393.5856793888337
“And who?” asked M. de Tréville.	321.24350936279774
“He, my thief!” replied D’Artagnan. “Ah, the traitor!” and he	359.6955751401127
disappeared.	393.8433864258077
“The devil take the madman!” murmured M. de Tréville, “unless,” added	429.5414003465849
he, “this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in	429.1600163130614
his purpose!”	400.3888092528406
Chapter IV.	344.21357225053555
THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF	371.37303680076
ARAMIS	402.7069637742221
D’Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three	479.5344797745423
bounds, and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon	418.78205752354853
descending four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head	309.67485245095514
foremost against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de	395.90913630711975
Tréville’s private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him	330.28228831844996
utter a cry, or rather a howl.	386.3657222612137
“Excuse me,” said D’Artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, “excuse	351.58756285388796
me, but I am in a hurry.”	321.4199261589382
Scarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized	481.91561022444046
him by the belt and stopped him.	329.898294370897
“You are in a hurry?” said the Musketeer, as pale as a sheet. “Under	496.48341721259544
that pretense you run against me! You say, ‘Excuse me,’ and you believe	320.5342899656816
that is sufficient? Not at all, my young man. Do you fancy because you	440.4188790206234
have heard Monsieur de Tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today	357.4146325563546
that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? Undeceive	319.9350599543261
yourself, comrade, you are not Monsieur de Tréville.”	488.9607607735518
“My faith!” replied D’Artagnan, recognizing Athos, who, after the	469.5398677604165
dressing performed by the doctor, was returning to his own apartment.	330.7440324153192
“I did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, I said	459.0156585515273
‘Excuse me.’ It appears to me that this is quite enough. I repeat to	462.1560272197037
you, however, and this time on my word of honor—I think perhaps too	412.374061356517
often—that I am in haste, great haste. Leave your hold, then, I beg of	480.64869622119073
you, and let me go where my business calls me.”	477.4635015842417
“Monsieur,” said Athos, letting him go, “you are not polite; it is easy	425.6586593174042
to perceive that you come from a distance.”	466.289741933625
D’Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athos’s	375.87096499636607
last remark he stopped short.	465.1239114634466
“_Morbleu_, monsieur!” said he, “however far I may come, it is not you	442.70476556834467
who can give me a lesson in good manners, I warn you.”	407.75787312649436
“Perhaps,” said Athos.	309.97309053379615
“Ah! If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after	402.412247295668
someone,” said D’Artagnan.	423.01787513754005
“Monsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running—_me_, you	342.19164600935375
understand?”	473.57711119143585
“And where, I pray you?”	462.78664367025203
“Near the Carmes-Deschaux.”	484.4129196312361
“At what hour?”	396.1903018919626
“About noon.”	397.7121373573804
“About noon? That will do; I will be there.”	348.88480688126145
“Endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut	429.1206241804043
off your ears as you run.”	497.7636272739232
“Good!” cried D’Artagnan, “I will be there ten minutes before twelve.”	345.5577548481733
And he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he	338.68797252482983
might yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him	325.0347121607837
far.	474.59870216797856
But at the street gate, Porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.	484.76720842028305
Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.	374.4105099143455
D’Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like	343.24821216916206
a dart between them. But D’Artagnan had reckoned without the wind. As	321.90803485143124
he was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthos’s long cloak, and	445.33380285760757
D’Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. Without doubt,	354.7099045308608
Porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for	380.7782386551489
instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he pulled it	320.44550533604706
toward him, so that D’Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a	495.7752560361771
movement of rotation explained by the persistency of Porthos.	302.9364545614488
D’Artagnan, hearing the Musketeer swear, wished to escape from the	317.70294182051
cloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the	481.07290332888044
folds of it. He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness	436.48205693167233
of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly	321.78266545366444
opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two	344.7532019881117
shoulders of Porthos—that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.	305.135464447198
Alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor	468.044135935129
but appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but	490.2471840211956
was nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious as he was, Porthos	428.05184388884186
could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least	399.3775534879324
half. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of	379.8427345545759
the cloak.	442.14840810140197
“Bless me!” cried Porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass	417.2349193191979
himself of D’Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; “you must be	419.20960339707347
mad to run against people in this manner.”	366.9039292388516
“Excuse me,” said D’Artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the	488.78446315662933
giant, “but I am in such haste—I was running after someone and—”	450.87825166303986
“And do you always forget your eyes when you run?” asked Porthos.	453.2222857956565
“No,” replied D’Artagnan, piqued, “and thanks to my eyes, I can see	358.65622532573923
what other people cannot see.”	437.68273550940216
Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to	472.5401681551284
his anger, “Monsieur,” said he, “you stand a chance of getting	424.63681627763424
chastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion.”	304.00103627741595
“Chastised, Monsieur!” said D’Artagnan, “the expression is strong.”	351.69322657924766
“It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the	402.6230470952436
face.”	303.434237521714
“Ah, _pardieu!_ I know full well that you don’t turn your back to	355.33268137511766
yours.”	415.7711489078198
And the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.	356.47890586306386
Porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after D’Artagnan.	366.2705164717088
“Presently, presently,” cried the latter, “when you haven’t your cloak	347.923288244705
on.”	340.6974140344217
“At one o’clock, then, behind the Luxembourg.”	328.0872544629372
“Very well, at one o’clock, then,” replied D’Artagnan, turning the	354.47714420359904
angle of the street.	315.6775059451895
But neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which	497.51360488056787
his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the	411.9228463369609
stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered	383.14937433869636
some house. D’Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to	310.57484775779216
the ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but	446.2043549019598
nothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, advantageous to	379.45061037576124
him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his	480.0543053745597
forehead, his heart began to cool.	372.5832490755505
He began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous	307.01933528331017
and inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven o’clock in the morning, and	363.5469832093908
yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de	479.1557707664342
Tréville, who could not fail to think the manner in which D’Artagnan	475.2271207568433
had left him a little cavalier.	494.2477933140641
Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,	491.127339317649
each capable of killing three D’Artagnans—with two Musketeers, in	321.3633731395657
short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he	313.26471343815825
placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.	459.91945939173024
The outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be	461.5250986047837
understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As	384.0880103660328
hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he	317.20025869777453
finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible	389.3966183986571
wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the	497.4337374918585
following reprehensions upon his own conduct:	414.38591779420005
“What a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am! That brave and	421.68611434944904
unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I	345.6053201988932
must run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me	387.37573710502915
is that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so;	339.56067216867285
the pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos—oh, as to	481.96472806029095
Porthos, faith, that’s a droll affair!”	491.9615835244959
And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking	468.4463586365522
round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a	320.12489225212613
cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.	347.772985482847
“As to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy	446.07221786799073
fool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any	351.361252908587
right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He	309.0126147599306
would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had	438.75345456749807
not said anything to him about that cursed baldric—in ambiguous words,	433.0670201906561
it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I	462.31676511729546
get from one hobble into another. Friend D’Artagnan,” continued he,	488.5444864868429
speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself,	372.3661486011599
“if you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you	468.4674160953556
to practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be	405.28236196608884
admired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not	446.4642830684577
necessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is	424.8883256962701
mildness and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling	415.5427908152281
Aramis a coward? No, certainly not, and from this moment I will	332.51224011010567
endeavor to model myself after him. Ah! That’s strange! Here he is!”	495.37821254940076
D’Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps	309.76937437156795
of the hôtel d’Arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived Aramis,	328.02373631285747
chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that	455.60245801111387
it was in presence of this young man that M. de Tréville had been so	494.9746514919634
angry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had	483.7908173630857
received was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see	318.54056554587174
him. D’Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of	321.2148358669867
conciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound	419.3884928001535
bow, accompanied by a most gracious smile. All four, besides,	480.88328451165677
immediately broke off their conversation.	304.22983633713517
D’Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many;	470.8074496068018
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world	385.089932881016
to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like	326.5789222507919
that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely	343.48958630310455
acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him. He was	368.16377669707526
seeking in his mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when	388.2735190203219
he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake,	319.94671639175016
no doubt, had placed his foot upon it. This appeared to be a favorable	450.198274286934
opportunity to repair his intrusion. He stooped, and with the most	407.8538149133559
gracious air he could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot	363.82691455440573
of the Musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it,	324.0238558594196
and holding it out to him, said, “I believe, monsieur, that this is a	464.53213171557707
handkerchief you would be sorry to lose?”	322.2641251897255
The handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and	497.9363589416913
arms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched	426.7607339735435
rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gascon.	391.9181110398722
“Ah, ah!” cried one of the Guards, “will you persist in saying, most	328.96017448837415
discreet Aramis, that you are not on good terms with Madame de	377.5873352307141
Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of	369.73502846155486
her handkerchiefs?”	414.3813432198292
Aramis darted at D’Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that	445.60226050510676
he has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming his mild air, “You are	458.4051186894434
deceived, gentlemen,” said he, “this handkerchief is not mine, and I	442.5479871312257
cannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me	299.6739173838939
rather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I say, here is mine	467.5363261321401
in my pocket.”	482.24734790096727
So saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant	411.2256188856893
handkerchief, and of fine cambric—though cambric was dear at the	469.16483007711315
period—but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only	302.34004177638883
ornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.	329.4658630808245
This time D’Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived his mistake; but the	329.1934707445761
friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of	384.96755627170086
them addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness. “If it	425.29134184478085
were as you pretend it is,” said he, “I should be forced, my dear	344.78354685065324
Aramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is	400.40680107288125
an intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the property of his wife	310.53103564099223
to be sported as a trophy.”	299.67470800227596
“You make the demand badly,” replied Aramis; “and while acknowledging	486.2408732990564
the justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of the form.”	387.10486735651943
“The fact is,” hazarded D’Artagnan, timidly, “I did not see the	303.4230388063034
handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis. He had his foot	453.095651859629
upon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot upon it the	414.3349819082028
handkerchief was his.”	481.05075232435587
“And you were deceived, my dear sir,” replied Aramis, coldly, very	441.52510262149156
little sensible to the reparation. Then turning toward that one of the	430.18499810626065
guards who had declared himself the friend of Bois-Tracy, “Besides,”	458.1650674372217
continued he, “I have reflected, my dear intimate of Bois-Tracy, that I	349.5347215532308
am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that	433.6020572158402
decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your	486.45894456402795
pocket as mine.”	396.3327814831753
“No, upon my honor!” cried his Majesty’s Guardsman.	452.444719203908
“You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word, and then it	314.1869115698652
will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied. Now, here,	337.38138113685676
Montaran, we will do better than that—let each take a half.”	314.2548075897105
“Of the handkerchief?”	308.89407211053623
“Yes.”	348.18939939114836
“Perfectly just,” cried the other two Guardsmen, “the judgment of King	428.7088359529821
Solomon! Aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!”	301.4637353378117
The young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair	431.33875836708444
had no other sequel. In a moment or two the conversation ceased, and	319.0178516229952
the three Guardsmen and the Musketeer, after having cordially shaken	453.3832947794616
hands, separated, the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis another.	463.9153169127404
“Now is my time to make peace with this gallant man,” said D’Artagnan	490.06320783975076
to himself, having stood on one side during the whole of the latter	336.1130679886579
part of the conversation; and with this good feeling drawing near to	391.40769765557303
Aramis, who was departing without paying any attention to him,	485.82806699289006
“Monsieur,” said he, “you will excuse me, I hope.”	318.18258479554737
“Ah, monsieur,” interrupted Aramis, “permit me to observe to you that	339.73349262498573
you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought.”	347.6338840251626
“What, monsieur!” cried D’Artagnan, “and do you suppose—”	417.92767468016586
“I suppose, monsieur, that you are not a fool, and that you knew very	469.12875674996377
well, although coming from Gascony, that people do not tread upon	396.91352279735116
handkerchiefs without a reason. What the devil! Paris is not paved with	484.47115103401944
cambric!”	320.4973324938142
“Monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me,” said	307.7066712116784
D’Artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more	404.3073574703995
loudly than his pacific resolutions. “I am from Gascony, it is true;	380.9836751795266
and since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons	370.9342620181305
are not very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once,	382.194521302968
were it even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done	309.2247332385328
already at least as much again as they ought to have done.”	392.3148461132915
“Monsieur, what I say to you about the matter,” said Aramis, “is not	412.2400193991697
for the sake of seeking a quarrel. Thank God, I am not a bravo! And	490.0263676541509
being a Musketeer but for a time, I only fight when I am forced to do	458.1541290085695
so, and always with great repugnance; but this time the affair is	374.23039144215113
serious, for here is a lady compromised by you.”	370.60854086242347
“By _us_, you mean!” cried D’Artagnan.	476.75013135981806
“Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?”	467.71593203521496
“Why did you so awkwardly let it fall?”	344.6039761376362
“I have said, monsieur, and I repeat, that the handkerchief did not	365.77365026109544
fall from my pocket.”	301.9936498780027
“And thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for I saw it fall.”	441.3468566907361
“Ah, you take it with that tone, do you, Master Gascon? Well, I will	451.64869119812744
teach you how to behave yourself.”	374.4623877874664
“And I will send you back to your Mass book, Master Abbé. Draw, if you	348.8971399729157
please, and instantly—”	405.03314940091184
“Not so, if you please, my good friend—not here, at least. Do you not	473.23714515347297
perceive that we are opposite the Hôtel d’Arguillon, which is full of	345.85770544583494
the cardinal’s creatures? How do I know that this is not his Eminence	434.09110081611396
who has honored you with the commission to procure my head? Now, I	347.43617485568114
entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, it seems to suit my	451.7906085131449
shoulders so correctly. I wish to kill you, be at rest as to that, but	496.1643942059327
to kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where you will not be able	335.146873129146
to boast of your death to anybody.”	345.8997956614221
“I agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident. Take your	466.86194472381334
handkerchief; whether it belongs to you or another, you may perhaps	426.1301274209558
stand in need of it.”	419.96341675726046
“Monsieur is a Gascon?” asked Aramis.	429.9267881624282
“Yes. Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?”	476.85152974438347
“Prudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently useless to Musketeers, I	398.4928355761381
know, but indispensable to churchmen; and as I am only a Musketeer	448.3196669928642
provisionally, I hold it good to be prudent. At two o’clock I shall	377.8140637276604
have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of Monsieur de Tréville.	383.01665472374646
There I will indicate to you the best place and time.”	439.6975063646689
The two young men bowed and separated, Aramis ascending the street	354.4300732434776
which led to the Luxembourg, while D’Artagnan, perceiving the appointed	328.2641743823062
hour was approaching, took the road to the Carmes-Deschaux, saying to	433.31183256522723
himself, “Decidedly I can’t draw back; but at least, if I am killed, I	341.60288826901905
shall be killed by a Musketeer.”	372.1463048684747
Chapter V.	430.7345325581166
THE KING’S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL’S GUARDS	429.43103771783046
D’Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris. He went therefore to	312.058974528224
his appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied	406.667913884914
with those his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was	431.2616747496664
formed to make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without	360.2996607065039
meanness or weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which	480.0724258505385
generally results from an affair of this kind, when a young and	448.7669391710532
vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened—if	390.89414649833094
conquered, he doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he	443.429827269159
is accused of foul play and want of courage.	488.8758052938807
Now, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker,	468.9194755708519
or our readers must have already perceived that D’Artagnan was not an	304.6704225339804
ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was	378.9544709217042
inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less	338.01320997962586
courageous and less restrained might have done in his place. He	357.76619850682386
reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going	482.7304181500795
to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. He hoped, by	423.08236231221076
means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and	471.7946751061568
austere bearing pleased him much. He flattered himself he should be	374.47940565764236
able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he	457.3606876559002
might, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital	459.76237348864197
which, well managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule. As to the	389.9769383978887
astute Aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he	392.55268295248425
should be able to get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good	327.11719347888595
style or at least, by hitting him in the face, as Cæsar recommended his	451.6143919277242
soldiers do to those of Pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which	495.1528526617495
he was so proud.	316.12718984072177
In addition to this, D’Artagnan possessed that invincible stock of	495.9476080452258
resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart:	419.1706521702133
“Endure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and Monsieur de	463.023493674826
Tréville.” He flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the	315.0037438326578
Carmes Déchaussés, or rather Deschaux, as it was called at that period,	369.07173728412647
a sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields—an	431.8277053891102
accessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the	333.0201266735281
place for the duels of men who had no time to lose.	466.88006430377476
When D’Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which	369.64499689726125
extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about	392.68021481428116
five minutes, and twelve o’clock was striking. He was, then, as	381.58767154584217
punctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with	370.6291650658047
regard to duels could have nothing to say.	337.0685883664125
Athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been	400.073780641751
dressed anew by M. de Tréville’s surgeon, was seated on a post and	415.0424962361725
waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching	386.31145567456076
the ground.	458.65747618165915
“Monsieur,” said Athos, “I have engaged two of my friends as seconds;	326.4983127897327
but these two friends are not yet come, at which I am astonished, as it	488.82278548385943
is not at all their custom.”	401.9014379840527
“I have no seconds on my part, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “for having	436.9560996809329
only arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but Monsieur de	416.24859549670145
Tréville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who has the honor to	384.2068754291845
be, in some degree, one of his friends.”	392.35905557619986
Athos reflected for an instant. “You know no one but Monsieur de	457.5688073721353
Tréville?” he asked.	441.069362602771
“Yes, monsieur, I know only him.”	341.21720378836073
“Well, but then,” continued Athos, speaking half to himself, “if I kill	339.1879802948798
you, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer.”	422.40104776751286
“Not too much so,” replied D’Artagnan, with a bow that was not	303.7766745996998
deficient in dignity, “since you do me the honor to draw a sword with	418.6977495212954
me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.”	319.06753812299866
“Very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, I can	321.57143433867054
tell you. But I will take the left hand—it is my custom in such	311.99935510002734
circumstances. Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use either hand	400.4966219327943
easily. And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is	488.8425864575606
very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it. I regret I did	485.93195060709087
not inform you sooner of this circumstance.”	471.7944509968669
“You have truly, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing again, “a courtesy,	383.586029871209
for which, I assure you, I am very grateful.”	431.91168769636374
“You confuse me,” replied Athos, with his gentlemanly air; “let us talk	471.6521029384265
of something else, if you please. Ah, s’blood, how you have hurt me! My	458.10347439031125
shoulder quite burns.”	369.41806221392267
“If you would permit me—” said D’Artagnan, with timidity.	459.7669618455301
“What, monsieur?”	471.32200361446303
“I have a miraculous balsam for wounds—a balsam given to me by my	409.98168830199563
mother and of which I have made a trial upon myself.”	479.63616712933447
“Well?”	437.8326911432164
“Well, I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure	317.3303540437332
you; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured—well, sir,	494.8085160688327
it would still do me a great honor to be your man.”	321.1956771081736
D’Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his	487.1303785459467
courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.	492.06834565639025
“_Pardieu_, monsieur!” said Athos, “that’s a proposition that pleases	345.11065145782635
me; not that I can accept it, but a league off it savors of the	482.5420443877226
gentleman. Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of	349.9781566553519
Charlemagne, in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model.	473.9152311518457
Unfortunately, we do not live in the times of the great emperor, we	374.2976924089015
live in the times of the cardinal; and three days hence, however well	363.83856408825136
the secret might be guarded, it would be known, I say, that we were to	359.88494854848415
fight, and our combat would be prevented. I think these fellows will	411.42983496348774
never come.”	416.99128392085584
“If you are in haste, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, with the same	494.86615978915404
simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off	494.0407310767546
the duel for three days, “and if it be your will to dispatch me at	312.07891090094444
once, do not inconvenience yourself, I pray you.”	452.3793995908083
“There is another word which pleases me,” cried Athos, with a gracious	399.81431312227204
nod to D’Artagnan. “That did not come from a man without a heart.	333.7505517720592
Monsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I foresee plainly that if we	454.83729057337786
don’t kill each other, I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your	362.4845688815217
conversation. We will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; I have	445.36286182725826
plenty of time, and it will be more correct. Ah, here is one of them, I	365.7430391280533
believe.”	346.2322519140201
In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.	484.7840211909845
“What!” cried D’Artagnan, “is your first witness Monsieur Porthos?”	357.78030515603245
“Yes, that disturbs you?”	389.6554211660277
“By no means.”	488.86704284324696
“And here is the second.”	375.9110494393219
D’Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived	422.3580618725427
Aramis.	365.2892889241115
“What!” cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,	377.4743456828753
“your second witness is Monsieur Aramis?”	479.06022703173693
“Doubtless! Are you not aware that we are never seen one without the	382.09123559903884
others, and that we are called among the Musketeers and the Guards, at	333.2139429304501
court and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or the Three	474.39551631703097
Inseparables? And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau—”	339.4417858758315
“From Tarbes,” said D’Artagnan.	327.3344517581042
“It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,” said Athos.	431.6026655246867
“My faith!” replied D’Artagnan, “you are well named, gentlemen; and my	480.65494033042376
adventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your	326.1501192361543
union is not founded upon contrasts.”	342.6158395760502
In the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos, and then	323.19457902657564
turning toward D’Artagnan, stood quite astonished.	494.300361420371
Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished	351.4337041528867
his cloak.	351.29753999407427
“Ah, ah!” said he, “what does this mean?”	383.7404850321931
“This is the gentleman I am going to fight with,” said Athos, pointing	488.69013221030184
to D’Artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.	310.52698886722305
“Why, it is with him I am also going to fight,” said Porthos.	409.82435694405706
“But not before one o’clock,” replied D’Artagnan.	318.5838342874832
“And I also am to fight with this gentleman,” said Aramis, coming in	464.81929127200885
his turn onto the place.	357.13232211591446
“But not until two o’clock,” said D’Artagnan, with the same calmness.	383.96978750967315
“But what are you going to fight about, Athos?” asked Aramis.	409.5728183852371
“Faith! I don’t very well know. He hurt my shoulder. And you, Porthos?”	496.3933152197945
“Faith! I am going to fight—because I am going to fight,” answered	497.3225389974089
Porthos, reddening.	328.6762623512559
Athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass	450.7263387445297
over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, “We had a short	336.79499517495617
discussion upon dress.”	317.27585374775896
“And you, Aramis?” asked Athos.	389.72834830884665
“Oh, ours is a theological quarrel,” replied Aramis, making a sign to	454.12813099358266
D’Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.	346.0912643367552
Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of D’Artagnan.	474.7507114539248
“Indeed?” said Athos.	467.7287928804129
“Yes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree,” said	355.5453929198147
the Gascon.	466.6587308709254
“Decidedly, this is a clever fellow,” murmured Athos.	493.93882492433033
“And now you are assembled, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “permit me to	466.2615059784428
offer you my apologies.”	305.69497723049545
At this word _apologies_, a cloud passed over the brow of Athos, a	408.0094229125996
haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative sign was the	325.7932671854874
reply of Aramis.	308.7549811808638
“You do not understand me, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, throwing up his	454.1669961364317
head, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a	493.3169163188054
bright ray of the sun. “I asked to be excused in case I should not be	326.02740921842116
able to discharge my debt to all three; for Monsieur Athos has the	305.324219297141
right to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your	451.38643476812115
bill, Monsieur Porthos, and render yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis.	326.50821563542746
And now, gentlemen, I repeat, excuse me, but on that account only,	318.5843300497864
and—on guard!”	384.3224225157984
At these words, with the most gallant air possible, D’Artagnan drew his	336.5522076389528
sword.	494.1541962618618
The blood had mounted to the head of D’Artagnan, and at that moment he	397.03827333110775
would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as	468.7152102591957
willingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.	477.0271364917129
It was a quarter past midday. The sun was in its zenith, and the spot	443.4435988692924
chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.	407.48185367713484
“It is very hot,” said Athos, drawing his sword in its turn, “and yet I	399.8540384866777
cannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed	387.9393040426976
again, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood	385.06994406109
which he has not drawn from me himself.”	352.5722517636591
“That is true, Monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and whether drawn by	330.7215689926052
myself or another, I assure you I shall always view with regret the	485.89879923992555
blood of so brave a gentleman. I will therefore fight in my doublet,	479.990576571137
like yourself.”	408.68161878030025
“Come, come, enough of such compliments!” cried Porthos. “Remember, we	360.35883951126914
are waiting for our turns.”	339.8403697397549
“Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,”	465.96885625219636
interrupted Aramis. “For my part, I think what they say is very well	312.2621480258153
said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen.”	493.1374406881521
“When you please, monsieur,” said Athos, putting himself on guard.	455.0056031466877
“I waited your orders,” said D’Artagnan, crossing swords.	457.13022986083087
But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the Guards	378.1103134248991
of his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the corner of the	458.6382912151329
convent.	379.92226546963764
“The cardinal’s Guards!” cried Aramis and Porthos at the same time.	374.0439113321252
“Sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!”	435.9497867503391
But it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position	392.257384252714
which left no doubt of their intentions.	379.97487531274
“Halloo!” cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his	409.8517803767422
men to do so likewise, “halloo, Musketeers? Fighting here, are you? And	433.95630516124527
the edicts? What is become of them?”	430.0319752578325
“You are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,” said Athos, full of	442.13601716256494
rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. “If	494.34679447772726
we were to see you fighting, I can assure you that we would make no	454.7967622405376
effort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a	309.17597865567575
little amusement without cost to yourselves.”	460.2853920682753
“Gentlemen,” said Jussac, “it is with great regret that I pronounce the	422.373898764371
thing impossible. Duty before everything. Sheathe, then, if you please,	327.9561557001931
and follow us.”	343.19626590899435
“Monsieur,” said Aramis, parodying Jussac, “it would afford us great	310.99377562136016
pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves;	420.95996346342343
but unfortunately the thing is impossible—Monsieur de Tréville has	335.8038338509763
forbidden it. Pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do.”	383.04461658580783
This raillery exasperated Jussac. “We will charge upon you, then,” said	334.2714861231527
he, “if you disobey.”	376.8429962177785
“There are five of them,” said Athos, half aloud, “and we are but	447.09642748907356
three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my	403.31005794526754
part, I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a	412.3076131437782
conquered man.”	426.2194560564376
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while	494.1087551477564
Jussac drew up his soldiers.	339.08648205632545
This short interval was sufficient to determine D’Artagnan on the part	484.6473490907276
he was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a	426.8116442977771
man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal—the choice made,	306.47879700183245
it must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that	299.30600304688596
was to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a	492.55648569757534
minister more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man	327.8566347180882
perceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a	413.40121563402874
second. Turning towards Athos and his friends, “Gentlemen,” said he,	445.8578000308021
“allow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but	388.4957368044503
three, but it appears to me we are four.”	319.6427978801997
“But you are not one of us,” said Porthos.	416.6968400722727
“That’s true,” replied D’Artagnan; “I have not the uniform, but I have	305.5117788711898
the spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it, monsieur, and	382.9819798815686
that impels me on.”	315.4202377369017
“Withdraw, young man,” cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and	343.2883339652172
the expression of his countenance, had guessed D’Artagnan’s design.	358.2971595446487
“You may retire; we consent to that. Save your skin; begone quickly.”	327.27869401718056
D’Artagnan did not budge.	436.89324266191716
“Decidedly, you are a brave fellow,” said Athos, pressing the young	329.8539669190926
man’s hand.	380.0114961440837
“Come, come, choose your part,” replied Jussac.	486.6670388482677
“Well,” said Porthos to Aramis, “we must do something.”	474.867104314498
“Monsieur is full of generosity,” said Athos.	381.48891672628315
But all three reflected upon the youth of D’Artagnan, and dreaded his	403.6884237553719
inexperience.	303.9587868492172
“We should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of	481.63923295463906
a boy,” resumed Athos; “and yet it will not be the less said we were	430.3273116864693
four men.”	363.0610573187542
“Yes, but to yield!” said Porthos.	413.098959986712
“That _is_ difficult,” replied Athos.	397.1705010779731
D’Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.	320.2820877970731
“Try me, gentlemen,” said he, “and I swear to you by my honor that I	395.84208669683545
will not go hence if we are conquered.”	465.3673717301863
“What is your name, my brave fellow?” said Athos.	319.07415703293924
“D’Artagnan, monsieur.”	383.1810406949744
“Well, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan, forward!” cried	496.25034162500117
Athos.	367.1110042981445
“Come, gentlemen, have you decided?” cried Jussac for the third time.	346.46578364893367
“It is done, gentlemen,” said Athos.	457.7709197994745
“And what is your choice?” asked Jussac.	426.7323906136739
“We are about to have the honor of charging you,” replied Aramis,	342.30614325870295
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.	348.1561144795371
“Ah! You resist, do you?” cried Jussac.	401.3650672851545
“S’blood; does that astonish you?”	355.358364571742
And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which	299.90540953175497
however did not exclude a certain degree of method.	362.67243367719726
Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal’s.	373.4427319267528
Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two	457.7327942142075
adversaries. As to D’Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.	420.8027115795325
The heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his	299.77989942051335
side—not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but	471.70902142077375
with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round	464.22673743932694
his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.	389.8730634516655
Jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice;	321.26834960528316
nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an	398.9778408506651
adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from	396.6292324588044
received rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying	399.57477572745927
like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.	400.62852540214226
This contest at length exhausted Jussac’s patience. Furious at being	473.5881730877438
held in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he became warm and	413.64721499269433
began to make mistakes. D’Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had	416.7757025058796
a sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, anxious to put an end to	301.1778726201319
this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but	332.94341228198584
the latter parried it; and while Jussac was recovering himself, glided	327.5799335108113
like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his	346.56911147309984
body. Jussac fell like a dead mass.	441.7679833786551
D’Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of	366.08038966920134
battle.	498.1864288797491
Aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him	358.35114753915957
warmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and able to	428.11833594033544
defend himself.	307.92274626061703
Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. Porthos had received a	483.74941234361205
thrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his thigh. But neither	347.98301994898577
of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.	447.2179446195662
Athos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not	390.65602373508625
give way a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and fought with his	483.39606129933446
left hand.	494.1144139386254
According to the laws of dueling at that period, D’Artagnan was at	410.7390360154402
liberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out	483.25426698927464
which of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from	364.4938130482966
Athos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died	338.3279593673352
rather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask	438.7246970970468
assistance. D’Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang	461.0237642881009
to the side of Cahusac, crying, “To me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay	349.4041314239489
you!”	392.39145901631235
Cahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone	456.7529824799609
supported him, sank upon his knee.	446.49333758044605
“S’blood!” cried he to D’Artagnan, “do not kill him, young man, I beg	441.2756353580352
of you. I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and	470.97406113221916
sound again. Disarm him only—make sure of his sword. That’s it! Very	343.50317557901377
well done!”	445.5704766095041
The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly	415.2676439502105
twenty paces from him. D’Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the	454.3448359410163
same instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but	475.76133383094486
D’Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot	482.44169991406244
upon it.	324.93983211470265
Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized	449.50427640573497
his rapier, and returned toward D’Artagnan; but on his way he met	367.7198123453546
Athos, who during his relief which D’Artagnan had procured him had	312.3338915478339
recovered his breath, and who, for fear that D’Artagnan would kill his	328.36162460122114
enemy, wished to resume the fight.	316.5800580289845
D’Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave	303.26763116946137
him alone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a sword thrust	378.85073570800125
through his throat.	378.29085589929
At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his	412.2459093165649
fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.	368.4054110083217
There only then remained Porthos and Bicarat. Porthos made a thousand	443.44547948847287
flourishes, asking Bicarat what o’clock it could be, and offering him	409.6032631815631
his compliments upon his brother’s having just obtained a company in	421.9193322904467
the regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing.	495.1712378663606
Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead.	387.8821897323661
Nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. The watch might come up and	453.4348275113106
take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.	458.46000989905974
Athos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan surrounded Bicarat, and required him to	437.1145011714465
surrender. Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,	397.9255374474189
Bicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,	437.47577786091006
cried out to him to yield. Bicarat was a Gascon, as D’Artagnan was; he	355.2138849971692
turned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two	446.6154545496132
parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword,	414.0358199890861
“Here,” cried he, parodying a verse of the Bible, “here will Bicarat	299.35959077327414
die; for I only am left, and they seek my life.”	431.76586104272917
“But there are four against you; leave off, I command you.”	469.8470898800052
“Ah, if you command me, that’s another thing,” said Bicarat. “As you	460.72909539991525
are my commander, it is my duty to obey.” And springing backward, he	366.98131838273383
broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering	490.6076128449913
it, threw the pieces over the convent wall, and crossed his arms,	491.78916249220265
whistling a cardinalist air.	433.89248853645034
Bravery is always respected, even in an enemy. The Musketeers saluted	352.011893285479
Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.	306.2248122420018
D’Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left	497.24398403742487
standing, they bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis’s adversaries	461.10490201367776
who was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The fourth, as we	332.93934173532216
have said, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying away four	449.19876313888295
swords out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward	391.3222287136787
the hôtel of M. de Tréville.	338.83462527991384
They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and	434.57040746552553
taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a	380.5637615455296
triumphal march. The heart of D’Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched	346.8983892035494
between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly.	372.95608309493366
“If I am not yet a Musketeer,” said he to his new friends, as he passed	479.7173437924258
through the gateway of M. de Tréville’s hôtel, “at least I have entered	436.5572551932361
upon my apprenticeship, haven’t I?”	445.7589270883238
Chapter VI.	317.59601358311073
HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII.	341.4800108205664
This affair made a great noise. M. de Tréville scolded his Musketeers	321.5856745415797
in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be	411.3240201085854
lost in gaining the king, M. de Tréville hastened to report himself at	471.1371867558006
the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the	440.0868596038457
cardinal, and M. de Tréville was informed that the king was busy and	483.4901945236065
could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Tréville	432.79239104844277
attended the king’s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was	359.71616040902506
very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de	480.3013432131152
Tréville at a distance—	496.5262637245758
“Come here, Monsieur Captain,” said he, “come here, that I may growl at	448.375751698287
you. Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints	307.92407158410913
against your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this	495.2792161703983
evening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these Musketeers of yours are	438.5759139695019
very devils—fellows to be hanged.”	308.6742922991436
“No, sire,” replied Tréville, who saw at the first glance how things	472.7024784425616
would go, “on the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs,	471.28685511877757
and have but one desire, I’ll be their warranty. And that is that their	370.1166965225058
swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty’s service.	433.0539835713017
But what are they to do? The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are	352.01016088047277
forever seeking quarrels with them, and for the honor of the corps	396.4692830419441
even, the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves.”	496.6831589284043
“Listen to Monsieur de Tréville,” said the king; “listen to him! Would	403.5395393785105
not one say he was speaking of a religious community? In truth, my dear	308.6580984312788
Captain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it	489.4667366104094
to Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey. But don’t	413.02638683036594
fancy that I am going to take you on your bare word. I am called Louis	362.68250671894526
the Just, Monsieur de Tréville, and by and by, by and by we will see.”	346.2524097251014
“Ah, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait	346.76703706794956
patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your Majesty.”	362.74862138023843
“Wait, then, monsieur, wait,” said the king; “I will not detain you	454.2659357621886
long.”	309.0320032384561
In fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had	305.02564993668943
won, he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne—if we	330.2052414823203
may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance. The	423.18701317724395
king therefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay	496.60234506020174
before him into his pocket, the major part of which arose from his	373.3403100315843
winnings, “La Vieuville,” said he, “take my place; I must speak to	418.65406028652285
Monsieur de Tréville on an affair of importance. Ah, I had eighty louis	449.47180196905924
before me; put down the same sum, so that they who have lost may have	381.20641903701926
nothing to complain of. Justice before everything.”	441.7924808557648
Then turning toward M. de Tréville and walking with him toward the	460.77298322972086
embrasure of a window, “Well, monsieur,” continued he, “you say it is	322.71826004520875
his Eminence’s Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers?”	382.8995887059317
“Yes, sire, as they always do.”	477.02319744888445
“And how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear	340.76248042642226
Captain, a judge must hear both sides.”	331.3800026032364
“Good Lord! In the most simple and natural manner possible. Three of my	496.3326228173431
best soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness	362.3403517082778
you have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to the	306.56935066338525
king, his service much at heart—three of my best soldiers, I say,	444.79473686626807
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young	473.3714423020942
fellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning.	384.6612345504245
The party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had	317.0181310031877
appointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by	488.2226538965719
de Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did	497.0095100376566
not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention	319.17530123704233
against the edicts.”	471.1570762685332
“Ah, ah! You incline me to think so,” said the king. “There is no doubt	468.3521182615234
they went thither to fight themselves.”	401.8781315225378
“I do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what	454.2322018488022
five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place	402.2871794707295
as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes.”	436.2121420328675
“Yes, you are right, Tréville, you are right!”	377.87841906209405
“Then, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot	385.3753764769339
their private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be	464.040875386666
ignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but the	445.2191622956757
king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the	428.86567164274595
cardinal.”	410.2450203984912
“Yes, Tréville, yes,” said the king, in a melancholy tone; “and it is	484.92003484923
very sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in France, two heads to	437.66248727761905
royalty. But all this will come to an end, Tréville, will come to an	420.3669599482397
end. You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the	437.9002181287265
Musketeers?”	408.86853734462875
“I say that it is probable that things have fallen out so, but I will	440.45283043041485
not swear to it, sire. You know how difficult it is to discover the	303.8218791454228
truth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which	341.92456712536585
causes Louis XIII. to be named the Just—”	352.27368255689026
“You are right, Tréville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers.	405.0785956583492
They had a youth with them?”	301.32109050328773
“Yes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king’s	494.3766234584975
Musketeers—one of whom was wounded—and a youth not only maintained	344.7178481490588
their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal’s	333.5651192879502
Guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.”	444.7762204165756
“Why, this is a victory!” cried the king, all radiant, “a complete	497.5694716557135
victory!”	311.8580215609674
“Yes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce.”	371.043896309294
“Four men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?”	467.6901186819854
“One hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably	324.7400285806419
on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to	469.71152729509424
your Majesty.”	440.6882257780069
“How does he call himself?”	376.6749205428825
“D’Artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my oldest friends—the son of	431.8703864996244
a man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the	361.8199173743297
civil war.”	497.69412282449787
“And you say this young man behaved himself well? Tell me how,	454.259649187106
Tréville—you know how I delight in accounts of war and fighting.”	458.9380067898396
And Louis XIII. twisted his mustache proudly, placing his hand upon his	409.887303654397
hip.	304.03138191508356
“Sire,” resumed Tréville, “as I told you, Monsieur d’Artagnan is little	332.29643059010414
more than a boy; and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer, he	394.94085175609393
was dressed as a citizen. The Guards of the cardinal, perceiving his	489.74153726519535
youth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire	480.68305380550987
before they attacked.”	320.2593510244341
“So you may plainly see, Tréville,” interrupted the king, “it was they	345.3821933349801
who attacked?”	409.03275689955035
“That is true, sire; there can be no more doubt on that head. They	480.8804197253027
called upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a Musketeer	497.1110966359922
at heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that therefore he would	485.6412094072382
remain with Messieurs the Musketeers.”	392.9470928811648
“Brave young man!” murmured the king.	467.2750663877265
“Well, he did remain with them; and your Majesty has in him so firm a	364.94615998850736
champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which	331.5103593345958
has made the cardinal so angry.”	368.585640994933
“He who wounded Jussac!” cried the king, “he, a boy! Tréville, that’s	444.9136077323212
impossible!”	336.3689379426278
“It is as I have the honor to relate it to your Majesty.”	377.02301431417726
“Jussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?”	354.8220371536808
“Well, sire, for once he found his master.”	299.20621763689104
“I will see this young man, Tréville—I will see him; and if anything	383.48449467913275
can be done—well, we will make it our business.”	410.54487699528767
“When will your Majesty deign to receive him?”	373.95929610865966
“Tomorrow, at midday, Tréville.”	406.50457876778705
“Shall I bring him alone?”	380.8847204366896
“No, bring me all four together. I wish to thank them all at once.	433.0874625998923
Devoted men are so rare, Tréville, by the back staircase. It is useless	300.1894700947074
to let the cardinal know.”	365.06117939001666
“Yes, sire.”	322.6716570759088
“You understand, Tréville—an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden	305.8676903100521
to fight, after all.”	331.7580418620617
“But this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a	362.8200530747463
duel. It is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of the	423.58461049157916
cardinal’s Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur	322.05612599137226
d’Artagnan.”	402.6733005542168
“That is true,” said the king; “but never mind, Tréville, come still by	345.94455768456976
the back staircase.”	426.45095661045593
Tréville smiled; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon	329.6053667149762
this child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king	477.4901417376054
respectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.	370.60321890089983
That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded	373.024895307326
them. As they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not	433.6830487286966
much excited; but D’Artagnan, with his Gascon imagination, saw in it	490.4145303977683
his future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. By eight	326.95753808376764
o’clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos.	345.74177304456134
D’Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go out. As the hour	422.1907178602558
to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with	483.1623559492149
Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated	477.2476277146444
near the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited D’Artagnan to follow	457.4413083066994
them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he	463.9627349216653
accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine o’clock in the	305.7487587362098
morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.	356.71730499144576
The two Musketeers were already there, and were playing together.	329.32682044381403
Athos, who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with	424.2604914150363
D’Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them; but at the first	343.08359442791556
effort he made, although he played with his left hand, he found that	426.9291312065137
his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion. D’Artagnan	359.3868870462874
remained, therefore, alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of	395.8717055237538
the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one	423.5664588956838
another without counting. But one of these balls, launched by Porthos’	339.393088140643
herculean hand, passed so close to D’Artagnan’s face that he thought	384.55006101778787
that if, instead of passing near, it had hit him, his audience would	485.2738083685948
have been probably lost, as it would have been impossible for him to	321.9529980815175
present himself before the king. Now, as upon this audience, in his	474.4193169565002
Gascon imagination, depended his future life, he saluted Aramis and	381.99659421842944
Porthos politely, declaring that he would not resume the game until he	321.9019419360349
should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms, and went and	415.8975465479127
took his place near the cord and in the gallery.	305.9323501719426
Unfortunately for D’Artagnan, among the spectators was one of his	386.12538875188864
Eminence’s Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his	419.07943842520774
companions, which had happened only the day before, had promised	448.9114184646231
himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He believed this	341.5243019976677
opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: “It is not	314.28441935659373
astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is	405.6247884424502
doubtless a Musketeer apprentice.”	314.5385107796209
D’Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his	406.2191535203294
eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent	361.16565260378667
speech.	393.5567894440926
“_Pardieu_,” resumed the latter, twisting his mustache, “look at me as	336.8109052929888
long as you like, my little gentleman! I have said what I have said.”	321.3671286129444
“And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any	330.7030918553089
explanation,” replied D’Artagnan, in a low voice, “I beg you to follow	405.489618209377
me.”	386.0869938622426
“And when?” asked the Guardsman, with the same jeering air.	462.0151741324594
“At once, if you please.”	465.45211510751426
“And you know who I am, without doubt?”	362.98404520561826
“I? I am completely ignorant; nor does it much disquiet me.”	459.46383120617213
“You’re in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would	457.4999907290678
not be so pressing.”	395.554681707794
“What is your name?”	467.18237119790683
“Bernajoux, at your service.”	488.57046688615645
“Well, then, Monsieur Bernajoux,” said D’Artagnan, tranquilly, “I will	319.523917447918
wait for you at the door.”	322.2168458671793
“Go, monsieur, I will follow you.”	325.02539151316546
“Do not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out	434.00784676225993
together. You must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be	380.22823514736734
in the way.”	486.01071033348705
“That’s true,” said the Guardsman, astonished that his name had not	439.76095747163845
produced more effect upon the young man.	440.5988370844334
Indeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world, D’Artagnan	442.2615763059497
alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most	393.7015799138264
frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal	377.0151844093904
could not repress.	402.23531659875044
Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game, and Athos was	455.5013845115699
watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive	388.43988320470896
their young companion go out, who, as he had told the Guardsman of his	347.232290049195
Eminence, stopped outside the door. An instant after, the Guardsman	457.65234447695343
descended in his turn. As D’Artagnan had no time to lose, on account of	441.49744842393653
the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes	412.61302168761756
around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary,	323.6296366966227
“My faith! It is fortunate for you, although your name is Bernajoux, to	313.98108108657675
have only to deal with an apprentice Musketeer. Never mind; be content,	315.98276813203347
I will do my best. On guard!”	308.7143893190735
“But,” said he whom D’Artagnan thus provoked, “it appears to me that	476.1986234582828
this place is badly chosen, and that we should be better behind the	443.4293626435617
Abbey St. Germain or in the Pré-aux-Clercs.”	345.7955767207057
“What you say is full of sense,” replied D’Artagnan; “but unfortunately	379.3355546239477
I have very little time to spare, having an appointment at twelve	422.71522597490207
precisely. On guard, then, monsieur, on guard!”	436.7689600363219
Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice. In	360.3892399545044
an instant his sword glittered in his hand, and he sprang upon his	459.16131183877087
adversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he hoped to	463.2143443340898
intimidate.	474.33152394572335
But D’Artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship.	373.50330184030446
Fresh sharpened by his victory, full of hopes of future favor, he was	385.84250098733116
resolved not to recoil a step. So the two swords were crossed close to	339.5203968333044
the hilts, and as D’Artagnan stood firm, it was his adversary who made	482.5623330142691
the retreating step; but D’Artagnan seized the moment at which, in this	419.25595122271585
movement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from the line. He freed his	304.75126705677343
weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder.	323.7584920782905
D’Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword; but	438.20983195373645
Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing, and rushing blindly upon him,	495.3871675027992
absolutely spitted himself upon D’Artagnan’s sword. As, however, he did	403.66997755252817
not fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away	435.21461438315345
toward the hôtel of M. de la Trémouille, in whose service he had a	312.2599467943338
relative, D’Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound	390.3022677521321
his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt	341.03831790304815
would soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise	348.0642509209862
which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the	378.6918924026243
friends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some	350.4063900577147
words with D’Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell	334.43384027522376
upon the conqueror. But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis quickly appeared in	338.8725372781828
their turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young	393.70020350195205
companion, drove them back. Bernajoux now fell, and as the Guardsmen	399.03194857011636
were only two against four, they began to cry, “To the rescue! The	494.97170684572575
Hôtel de la Trémouille!” At these cries, all who were in the hôtel	455.06280830977664
rushed out and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried	353.5031836905703
aloud, “To the rescue, Musketeers!”	347.1638892342858
This cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers were known to be	440.8109368593829
enemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account of the hatred they	318.2027832369702
bore to his Eminence. Thus the soldiers of other companies than those	346.5862223059083
which belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had called him, often took	456.6146785680511
part with the king’s Musketeers in these quarrels. Of three Guardsmen	447.3668915892252
of the company of M. Dessessart who were passing, two came to the	487.32198449868247
assistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the hôtel	456.9256993836556
of M. de Tréville, crying, “To the rescue, Musketeers! To the rescue!”	430.0814020645046
As usual, this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company, who hastened	414.9557768101575
to the succor of their comrades. The _mêlée_ became general, but	408.766514766406
strength was on the side of the Musketeers. The cardinal’s Guards and	407.7642187041057
M. de la Trémouille’s people retreated into the hôtel, the doors of	411.209913173425
which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering	447.2098586049651
with them. As to the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and, as	413.7742643038456
we have said, in a very bad state.	488.32711376212535
Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies, and	367.4940049584575
they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the	440.9923624576296
hôtel to punish the insolence of M. de la Trémouille’s domestics in	434.06001864853965
daring to make a _sortie_ upon the king’s Musketeers. The proposition	470.74014086579683
had been made, and received with enthusiasm, when fortunately eleven	447.07470597224244
o’clock struck. D’Artagnan and his companions remembered their	426.58910374126737
audience, and as they would very much have regretted that such an	444.3786454806402
opportunity should be lost, they succeeded in calming their friends,	482.72004853871755
who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the	385.1155630764306
gates; but the gates were too strong. They soon tired of the sport.	485.8213670139331
Besides, those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had	383.8048345166804
quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of M. de	415.19517281660154
Tréville, who was waiting for them, already informed of this fresh	384.1264583333346
disturbance.	350.66690367491367
“Quick to the Louvre,” said he, “to the Louvre without losing an	391.7436128237306
instant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by	334.8674095025408
the cardinal. We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the	347.7322075608914
affair of yesterday, and the two will pass off together.”	324.7111349043381
M. de Tréville, accompanied by the four young fellows, directed his	404.63290552600387
course toward the Louvre; but to the great astonishment of the captain	474.77797763146594
of the Musketeers, he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting	354.16500196890433
in the forest of St. Germain. M. de Tréville required this intelligence	355.66027125008895
to be repeated to him twice, and each time his companions saw his brow	335.2163970524963
become darker.	305.33184595507106
“Had his Majesty,” asked he, “any intention of holding this hunting	336.062663346757
party yesterday?”	343.05902196753095
“No, your Excellency,” replied the valet de chambre, “the Master of the	327.55484627317014
Hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag.	475.6230712471546
At first the king answered that he would not go; but he could not	398.54019712871263
resist his love of sport, and set out after dinner.”	375.2708951213469
“And the king has seen the cardinal?” asked M. de Tréville.	354.52130854183093
“In all probability he has,” replied the valet, “for I saw the horses	308.1404880397713
harnessed to his Eminence’s carriage this morning, and when I asked	390.59140414174533
where he was going, they told me, ‘To St. Germain.’”	493.58941386537333
“He is beforehand with us,” said M. de Tréville. “Gentlemen, I will see	306.60025662654596
the king this evening; but as to you, I do not advise you to risk doing	422.9031631006277
so.”	327.7493535564357
This advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew	401.28382338343687
the king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it. M. de	379.6175770698231
Tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news.	399.70512865500257
On entering his hôtel, M. de Tréville thought it best to be first in	484.487709597965
making the complaint. He sent one of his servants to M. de la	320.5803956813242
Trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the	433.38007619088347
cardinal’s Guardsmen from his house, and to reprimand his people for	403.98116920634465
their audacity in making _sortie_ against the king’s Musketeers. But M.	351.1555778961682
de la Trémouille—already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as	317.6048639665218
we already know, Bernajoux was—replied that it was neither for M. de	316.7568975287123
Tréville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for him,	303.1596351662032
whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had	462.2135174773863
endeavored to burn. Now, as the debate between these two nobles might	490.863370195554
last a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own	413.300460207363
opinion, M. de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate	494.08780821895846
it quietly. This was to go himself to M. de la Trémouille.	392.7656675222142
He repaired, therefore, immediately to his hôtel, and caused himself to	378.30983621454277
be announced.	412.0835167921437
The two nobles saluted each other politely, for if no friendship	390.259251098332
existed between them, there was at least esteem. Both were men of	316.9177015256995
courage and honor; and as M. de la Trémouille—a Protestant, and seeing	498.8370301350352
the king seldom—was of no party, he did not, in general, carry any bias	319.6219051905415
into his social relations. This time, however, his address, although	405.4030608610766
polite, was cooler than usual.	304.47598150998067
“Monsieur,” said M. de Tréville, “we fancy that we have each cause to	489.8081541502851
complain of the other, and I am come to endeavor to clear up this	431.51410170974395
affair.”	339.6865081036775
“I have no objection,” replied M. de la Trémouille, “but I warn you	303.6936040203554
that I am well informed, and all the fault is with your Musketeers.”	376.80012566354554
“You are too just and reasonable a man, monsieur!” said Tréville, “not	322.1977972227805
to accept the proposal I am about to make to you.”	414.10979804169824
“Make it, monsieur, I listen.”	363.394316613633
“How is Monsieur Bernajoux, your esquire’s relative?”	323.213475064793
“Why, monsieur, very ill indeed! In addition to the sword thrust in his	431.15531008548066
arm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his	394.9481836871792
lungs, of which the doctor says bad things.”	336.2982322930811
“But has the wounded man retained his senses?”	305.3033497787627
“Perfectly.”	356.8680335367767
“Does he talk?”	452.55285597880845
“With difficulty, but he can speak.”	417.4031834909885
“Well, monsieur, let us go to him. Let us adjure him, in the name of	409.23018931817376
the God before whom he must perhaps appear, to speak the truth. I will	329.5675235748253
take him for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and will believe what he	324.44405658749037
will say.”	343.72537565166147
M. de la Trémouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult	364.4318695441652
to suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.	459.80407837430005
Both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay. The latter,	311.06159294683425
on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him, endeavored to	342.5824446733095
raise himself up in his bed; but he was too weak, and exhausted by the	336.13758688004026
effort, he fell back again almost senseless.	416.74126546815796
M. de la Trémouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts,	382.7975671332414
which recalled him to life. Then M. de Tréville, unwilling that it	429.68900149562484
should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man, requested M.	463.8814330799765
de la Trémouille to interrogate him himself.	391.1203091682802
That happened which M. de Tréville had foreseen. Placed between life	331.61610230328245
and death, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing	448.8769406578931
the truth; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it	478.7564029601343
had passed.	447.7760499830529
This was all that M. de Tréville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy	305.58070451131624
convalescence, took leave of M. de la Trémouille, returned to his	301.34926423677683
hôtel, and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited	379.1142349053781
their company at dinner.	352.44969362948206
M. de Tréville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist,	467.69591851137477
though. It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation	395.24893961377575
during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his	460.5829468803511
Eminence’s Guardsmen had received. Now, as D’Artagnan had been the hero	305.9908928715386
of these two fights, it was upon him that all the felicitations fell,	351.41933184011714
which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good	410.8482587612572
comrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that they could	341.5041550188718
very well afford him his.	495.45434757446634
Toward six o’clock M. de Tréville announced that it was time to go to	433.7001190776228
the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was	342.6048366513381
past, instead of claiming the _entrée_ by the back stairs, he placed	410.73829500151976
himself with the four young men in the antechamber. The king had not	385.63273038267727
yet returned from hunting. Our young men had been waiting about half an	304.46538058914166
hour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown open,	364.93467745023923
and his Majesty was announced.	489.3611697052756
At his announcement D’Artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow	436.5792725412943
of his bones. The coming instant would in all probability decide the	428.02748858673533
rest of his life. His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon	344.89052919123947
the door through which the king must enter.	404.57658759396554
Louis XIII. appeared, walking fast. He was in hunting costume covered	352.32042363365645
with dust, wearing large boots, and holding a whip in his hand. At the	348.01080763454183
first glance, D’Artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.	417.5754693562929
This disposition, visible as it was in his Majesty, did not prevent the	324.75714823630915
courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. In royal	299.38989124830124
antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not	452.94096137327466
to be seen at all. The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to	390.12690358000066
make a step forward. D’Artagnan on the contrary remained concealed	304.9077801629864
behind them; but although the king knew Athos, Porthos, and Aramis	471.5747287391651
personally, he passed before them without speaking or looking—indeed,	396.3925444701519
as if he had never seen them before. As for M. de Tréville, when the	439.468423749889
eyes of the king fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much	389.06016848346394
firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes; after which his	308.21319966079903
Majesty, grumbling, entered his apartment.	417.71645886546173
“Matters go but badly,” said Athos, smiling; “and we shall not be made	338.02502700846753
Chevaliers of the Order this time.”	481.18171098147866
“Wait here ten minutes,” said M. de Tréville; “and if at the expiration	457.6210688312192
of ten minutes you do not see me come out, return to my hôtel, for it	420.8681954373434
will be useless for you to wait for me longer.”	353.766305178794
The four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, twenty	486.7842106408592
minutes; and seeing that M. de Tréville did not return, went away very	395.16189826956634
uneasy as to what was going to happen.	442.3354121739103
M. de Tréville entered the king’s cabinet boldly, and found his Majesty	373.4153621725731
in a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, beating his boot with the	482.17390283662627
handle of his whip. This, however, did not prevent his asking, with the	400.79046412446996
greatest coolness, after his Majesty’s health.	483.08050879704365
“Bad, monsieur, bad!” replied the king; “I am bored.”	412.5238559844378
This was, in fact, the worst complaint of Louis XIII., who would	494.66724833521664
sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say, “Monsieur	497.4339832214297
So-and-so, let us weary ourselves together.”	362.28064277867463
“How! Your Majesty is bored? Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the	404.34020848137106
chase today?”	464.36301556519084
“A fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur! Upon my soul, everything	392.34574697639914
degenerates; and I don’t know whether it is the game which leaves no	381.0586351930713
scent, or the dogs that have no noses. We started a stag of ten	343.55467975722627
branches. We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being	404.59351154693354
taken—when St. Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound	454.32166032344674
the _halali_—crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off	415.79299112309593
after a two-year-older. I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I	399.3888510890046
have given up hawking. Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de	419.1600679062227
Tréville! I had but one gerfalcon, and he died day before yesterday.”	343.3562386010702
“Indeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your disappointment. The misfortune	420.46261599010563
is great; but I think you have still a good number of falcons, sparrow	441.732685124813
hawks, and tiercels.”	416.5812453162415
“And not a man to instruct them. Falconers are declining. I know no one	489.798602358067
but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery. After me it	373.3724875737766
will all be over, and people will hunt with gins, snares, and traps. If	437.29721017984855
I had but the time to train pupils! But there is the cardinal always at	313.4783312849242
hand, who does not leave me a moment’s repose; who talks to me about	402.3887665491009
Spain, who talks to me about Austria, who talks to me about England!	329.3275505024387
Ah! _à propos_ of the cardinal, Monsieur de Tréville, I am vexed with	384.8022471844612
you!”	340.2166324036292
This was the chance at which M. de Tréville waited for the king. He	454.2369363567559
knew the king of old, and he knew that all these complaints were but a	412.7245294979103
preface—a sort of excitation to encourage himself—and that he had now	310.19721452552744
come to his point at last.	437.23525665186025
“And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty?”	418.8526882792685
asked M. de Tréville, feigning the most profound astonishment.	405.7149807841654
“Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?” continued the king,	487.1641421385847
without directly replying to de Tréville’s question. “Is it for this I	332.66311045978546
name you captain of my Musketeers, that they should assassinate a man,	386.1308869218921
disturb a whole quarter, and endeavor to set fire to Paris, without	396.8365689842114
your saying a word? But yet,” continued the king, “undoubtedly my haste	409.59253840368433
accuses you wrongfully; without doubt the rioters are in prison, and	359.7289870019872
you come to tell me justice is done.”	300.6914250530354
“Sire,” replied M. de Tréville, calmly, “on the contrary, I come to	482.389995073875
demand it of you.”	350.1625470126019
“And against whom?” cried the king.	403.592723286876
“Against calumniators,” said M. de Tréville.	303.42720017197723
“Ah! This is something new,” replied the king. “Will you tell me that	426.8575572276827
your three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and your	394.75645195344384
youngster from Béarn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor	498.3502151004756
Bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably	360.5292820354128
by this time he is dead? Will you tell me that they did not lay siege	372.1371842129152
to the hôtel of the Duc de la Trémouille, and that they did not	323.26802681642204
endeavor to burn it?—which would not, perhaps, have been a great	403.4769615873594
misfortune in time of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of	302.56155315786117
Huguenots, but which is, in time of peace, a frightful example. Tell	390.2686824967792
me, now, can you deny all this?”	346.22405347555593
“And who told you this fine story, sire?” asked Tréville, quietly.	388.03210059577145
“Who has told me this fine story, monsieur? Who should it be but he who	496.8174598129108
watches while I sleep, who labors while I amuse myself, who conducts	308.05810379019664
everything at home and abroad—in France as in Europe?”	491.51837248455536
“Your Majesty probably refers to God,” said M. de Tréville; “for I know	303.64110567726965
no one except God who can be so far above your Majesty.”	446.60784648302746
“No, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of	326.00150415311526
my only friend—of the cardinal.”	308.8678124466097
“His Eminence is not his holiness, sire.”	444.3522188749432
“What do you mean by that, monsieur?”	474.59277985900565
“That it is only the Pope who is infallible, and that this	436.4919258518854
infallibility does not extend to cardinals.”	412.3726071647084
“You mean to say that he deceives me; you mean to say that he betrays	347.06350377604844
me? You accuse him, then? Come, speak; avow freely that you accuse	479.26610682839777
him!”	387.0924754006219
“No, sire, but I say that he deceives himself. I say that he is	315.975171105661
ill-informed. I say that he has hastily accused your Majesty’s	403.11450406764317
Musketeers, toward whom he is unjust, and that he has not obtained his	389.778047778021
information from good sources.”	422.2550454589424
“The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Trémouille, from the duke	300.69111257406104
himself. What do you say to that?”	438.03257343665916
“I might answer, sire, that he is too deeply interested in the question	348.10528218964384
to be a very impartial witness; but so far from that, sire, I know the	405.7644876052656
duke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer the matter to him—but upon	322.41215849777114
one condition, sire.”	339.8033958794872
“What?”	361.05905918373594
“It is that your Majesty will make him come here, will interrogate him	342.9152276453799
yourself, _tête-à-tête_, without witnesses, and that I shall see your	382.07263799452556
Majesty as soon as you have seen the duke.”	444.4137544787144
“What, then! You will bind yourself,” cried the king, “by what Monsieur	337.81512475935943
de la Trémouille shall say?”	372.5314240283775
“Yes, sire.”	302.13665929408535
“You will accept his judgment?”	467.1398308967347
“Undoubtedly.”	380.97219632057846
“And you will submit to the reparation he may require?”	433.768664528818
“Certainly.”	313.69127369633816
“La Chesnaye,” said the king. “La Chesnaye!”	477.0737823023351
Louis XIII.’s confidential valet, who never left the door, entered in	372.3302267726361
reply to the call.	299.17370076249387
“La Chesnaye,” said the king, “let someone go instantly and find	410.61614527532754
Monsieur de la Trémouille; I wish to speak with him this evening.”	480.0663631226678
“Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between	303.1042256109332
Monsieur de la Trémouille and myself?”	316.1643654060119
“Nobody, by the faith of a gentleman.”	444.13441163193875
“Tomorrow, then, sire?”	447.95649180344583
“Tomorrow, monsieur.”	369.82802716125786
“At what o’clock, please your Majesty?”	406.0263415703929
“At any hour you will.”	304.4283676948894
“But in coming too early I should be afraid of awakening your Majesty.”	389.98682643908927
“Awaken me! Do you think I ever sleep, then? I sleep no longer,	444.2265318635938
monsieur. I sometimes dream, that’s all. Come, then, as early as you	427.4429890205439
like—at seven o’clock; but beware, if you and your Musketeers are	326.3965046408157
guilty.”	367.6269335367298
“If my Musketeers are guilty, sire, the guilty shall be placed in your	452.61757452205086
Majesty’s hands, who will dispose of them at your good pleasure. Does	462.4159361973883
your Majesty require anything further? Speak, I am ready to obey.”	411.2687285728568
“No, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason.	413.52657477832986
Tomorrow, then, monsieur—tomorrow.”	307.1080909709209
“Till then, God preserve your Majesty!”	300.20828184424425
However ill the king might sleep, M. de Tréville slept still worse. He	393.59727607383144
had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at	382.1592710463178
half past six in the morning. He took them with him, without	410.9450138186361
encouraging them or promising them anything, and without concealing	304.3899120503864
from them that their luck, and even his own, depended upon the cast of	328.5267014594427
the dice.	390.5153993723944
Arrived at the foot of the back stairs, he desired them to wait. If the	374.4320059551844
king was still irritated against them, they would depart without being	306.7852425619368
seen; if the king consented to see them, they would only have to be	489.1497858644624
called.	307.60591486339575
On arriving at the king’s private antechamber, M. de Tréville found La	481.7637556097268
Chesnaye, who informed him that they had not been able to find M. de la	340.11184739016403
Trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel, that he returned too	455.3202866172106
late to present himself at the Louvre, that he had only that moment	362.3379344949141
arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king.	490.68228062384526
This circumstance pleased M. de Tréville much, as he thus became	493.11423609646874
certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between M. de	356.97747217161975
la Trémouille’s testimony and himself.	428.0440041499949
In fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the	362.8336549956369
king’s closet opened, and M. de Tréville saw M. de la Trémouille come	371.73210961192626
out. The duke came straight up to him, and said: “Monsieur de Tréville,	345.7147054910122
his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the	492.1648391544949
circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel. I have told him	367.1023163995219
the truth; that is to say, that the fault lay with my people, and that	388.40540516435215
I was ready to offer you my excuses. Since I have the good fortune to	347.9329412182589
meet you, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of	309.4370143015442
your friends.”	455.7594856609405
“Monsieur the Duke,” said M. de Tréville, “I was so confident of your	458.1076049718129
loyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than	329.0434000501854
yourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I thank you that	415.2308079554265
there is still one man in France of whom may be said, without	429.77683910435064
disappointment, what I have said of you.”	443.6455350237577
“That’s well said,” cried the king, who had heard all these compliments	479.42424173713823
through the open door; “only tell him, Tréville, since he wishes to be	478.38934184069683
considered your friend, that I also wish to be one of his, but he	393.51223897630956
neglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have seen him, and	361.2543681852217
that I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him all this for	303.8177611460289
me, for these are things which a king cannot say for himself.”	432.9193860164785
“Thanks, sire, thanks,” said the duke; “but your Majesty may be assured	407.3866445607547
that it is not those—I do not speak of Monsieur de Tréville—whom your	327.1276227809536
Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you.”	306.64166840200477
“Ah! You have heard what I said? So much the better, Duke, so much the	377.2802434927831
better,” said the king, advancing toward the door. “Ah! It is you,	377.997669884945
Tréville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you the day before	336.3309439415077
yesterday to bring them with you; why have you not done so?”	453.22655228520796
“They are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid	402.44337254088146
them come up.”	416.1509005519334
“Yes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is nearly eight o’clock,	458.52689133448763
and at nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, and return often. Come	404.1675427852066
in, Tréville.”	382.0358665957126
The Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he opened the door, the	475.26713103708744
three Musketeers and D’Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at	357.9886323981411
the top of the staircase.	333.0147971034357
“Come in, my braves,” said the king, “come in; I am going to scold	475.27696009536237
you.”	334.1235641243467
The Musketeers advanced, bowing, D’Artagnan following closely behind	352.97366710071515
them.	466.12528662480224
“What the devil!” continued the king. “Seven of his Eminence’s Guards	328.3967903165255
placed _hors de combat_ by you four in two days! That’s too many,	330.349331319766
gentlemen, too many! If you go on so, his Eminence will be forced to	367.0718044552601
renew his company in three weeks, and I to put the edicts in force in	334.79227079884834
all their rigor. One now and then I don’t say much about; but seven in	404.5376329782937
two days, I repeat, it is too many, it is far too many!”	365.13411168136145
“Therefore, sire, your Majesty sees that they are come, quite contrite	481.80449224498955
and repentant, to offer you their excuses.”	333.23981683857164
“Quite contrite and repentant! Hem!” said the king. “I place no	306.8095057027324
confidence in their hypocritical faces. In particular, there is one	372.1843519797852
yonder of a Gascon look. Come hither, monsieur.”	318.5005838508482
D’Artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was	356.94517614387496
addressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.	322.78296768181053
“Why, you told me he was a young man? This is a boy, Tréville, a mere	326.6760610267489
boy! Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust	482.3357240373808
at Jussac?”	395.43273179380526
“And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernajoux.”	418.62474201545024
“Truly!”	304.36031436438327
“Without reckoning,” said Athos, “that if he had not rescued me from	448.6868995004152
the hands of Cahusac, I should not now have the honor of making my very	331.8594467849957
humble reverence to your Majesty.”	445.12896218620597
“Why he is a very devil, this Béarnais! _Ventre-saint-gris_, Monsieur	419.3233892629561
de Tréville, as the king my father would have said. But at this sort of	449.01292496449275
work, many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken. Now,	356.4554100020291
Gascons are always poor, are they not?”	496.5916895136378
“Sire, I can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in	428.43492586608346
their mountains; though the Lord owes them this miracle in recompense	488.6768500377208
for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your	302.7190028176858
father.”	472.17314512981227
“Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me, myself, seeing	389.0388897084449
that I am my father’s son, is it not, Tréville? Well, happily, I don’t	358.6722357816081
say nay to it. La Chesnaye, go and see if by rummaging all my pockets	450.8256838709982
you can find forty pistoles; and if you can find them, bring them to	337.9075950668619
me. And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience,	310.89050790740424
how did all this come to pass?”	403.8597085272781
D’Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its	454.3500436366875
details; how, not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the	488.5728874640471
expectation of seeing his Majesty, he had gone to his three friends	484.2510654074819
three hours before the hour of audience; how they had gone together to	342.21944619095984
the tennis court, and how, upon the fear he had manifested lest he	406.95731433108335
receive a ball in the face, he had been jeered at by Bernajoux, who had	468.40147459855183
nearly paid for his jeer with his life, and M. de la Trémouille, who	474.197790608772
had nothing to do with the matter, with the loss of his hôtel.	300.03162743773595
“This is all very well,” murmured the king, “yes, this is just the	399.43688093561417
account the duke gave me of the affair. Poor cardinal! Seven men in two	447.0019512427086
days, and those of his very best! But that’s quite enough, gentlemen;	374.72028883300936
please to understand, that’s enough. You have taken your revenge for	331.01697230931404
the Rue Férou, and even exceeded it; you ought to be satisfied.”	362.0244490869129
“If your Majesty is so,” said Tréville, “we are.”	422.4224461543086
“Oh, yes; I am,” added the king, taking a handful of gold from La	369.2110496792781
Chesnaye, and putting it into the hand of D’Artagnan. “Here,” said he,	300.7205387439165
“is a proof of my satisfaction.”	407.43056428519037
At this epoch, the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did	313.3433103774516
not prevail. A gentleman received, from hand to hand, money from the	326.45111407795633
king, and was not the least in the world humiliated. D’Artagnan put his	420.46720698993994
forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple—on the contrary,	305.8222097685889
thanking his Majesty greatly.	368.7552882828157
“There,” said the king, looking at a clock, “there, now, as it is half	377.0988635481878
past eight, you may retire; for as I told you, I expect someone at	402.57796294592265
nine. Thanks for your devotedness, gentlemen. I may continue to rely	356.29253748819076
upon it, may I not?”	496.3812763645517
“Oh, sire!” cried the four companions, with one voice, “we would allow	448.2977698078223
ourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majesty’s service.”	425.63844723940144
“Well, well, but keep whole; that will be better, and you will be more	421.0504960735168
useful to me. Tréville,” added the king, in a low voice, as the others	317.79341710260536
were retiring, “as you have no room in the Musketeers, and as we have	415.07033427357885
besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that	316.5272153086889
corps, place this young man in the company of the Guards of Monsieur	406.47435090683496
Dessessart, your brother-in-law. Ah, _pardieu_, Tréville! I enjoy	324.26511443177867
beforehand the face the cardinal will make. He will be furious; but I	394.76609896802785
don’t care. I am doing what is right.”	375.7363228647803
The king waved his hand to Tréville, who left him and rejoined the	462.36350469469653
Musketeers, whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with D’Artagnan.	355.8226572044806
The cardinal, as his Majesty had said, was really furious, so furious	334.6191824752803
that during eight days he absented himself from the king’s gaming	464.8162439515853
table. This did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as	322.1562909148448
possible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone,	347.80832255295286
“Well, Monsieur Cardinal, how fares it with that poor Jussac and that	450.2200655486499
poor Bernajoux of yours?”	330.6227818946299
Chapter VII.	490.5516566048673
THE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS	310.5442462012579
When D’Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon	396.1442339005364
the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos	328.43736806459583
advised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to	479.16797864061874
engage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable	364.191107477996
mistress.	338.1347548759836
The repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited	445.8683713970798
at table. The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey	339.46483590239393
furnished by Porthos. He was a Picard, whom the glorious Musketeer had	450.0783772423167
picked up on the Bridge Tournelle, making rings and plashing in the	324.7837684028451
water.	389.2051320912105
Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and	333.6127763789821
contemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any	337.22173267810183
other recommendation. The noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he	459.37752536158484
believed himself to be engaged, had won Planchet—that was the name of	376.15169835354936
the Picard. He felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that	424.2880594244051
this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton, and when	414.3751178614633
Porthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,	361.1875417732755
would not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service	322.31214087804176
of D’Artagnan. Nevertheless, when he waited at the dinner given by his	398.07481579851316
master, and saw him take out a handful of gold to pay for it, he	462.36316306331474
believed his fortune made, and returned thanks to heaven for having	476.3531174445684
thrown him into the service of such a Crœsus. He preserved this	303.17772680031914
opinion even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired	480.4152214935043
his own long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his master’s	419.62154572672824
bed, the chimeras of Planchet faded away. The bed was the only one in	386.9206115809865
the apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom.	328.30122664245744
Planchet slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of	364.0183203593254
D’Artagnan, and which D’Artagnan from that time made shift to do	339.5755373557972
without.	366.15441428011206
Athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a	468.2839605819066
thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named Grimaud. He was very	304.11067080826996
