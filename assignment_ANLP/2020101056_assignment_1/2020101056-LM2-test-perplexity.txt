taciturn, this worthy signor. Be it understood we are speaking of	491.3166496012253
Athos. During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest	416.69841534516166
intimacy with his companions, Porthos and Aramis, they could remember	406.25182104780754
having often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. His words	415.0919003558664
were brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more;	324.1484537344555
no embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. His conversation was a	333.32149023334017
matter of fact, without a single romance.	304.0827928161748
Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal	422.44118981707345
beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a	323.27879726859044
mistress. He never spoke of women. He certainly did not prevent others	359.65392810900397
from speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that	336.20070281654785
this kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and	336.0284442494853
misanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. His reserve, his	346.19759265164043
roughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. He had, then,	426.77114026494684
in order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon	460.18736061510697
a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. He never spoke	395.1161164982432
to him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.	411.3103815443353
Sometimes, Grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while	400.8733487372824
entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration	405.8149342708076
for his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew	435.953205818722
to execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. Athos	353.3708425839697
then shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,	421.9869990556375
thrashed Grimaud. On these days he spoke a little.	463.18742339231653
Porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of	351.7356087964715
Athos. He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we	296.47079442552416
must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not.	414.680122941555
He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing	488.4697598514598
himself talk. He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging	402.0552884576269
in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his	372.2002701017996
childhood. He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of	308.68574756692055
their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he	474.73407702842417
endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. But with his simple	417.0209123161943
Musketeer’s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back	323.0030725663074
his head and advanced his foot, Athos instantly took the place which	383.81637132529244
was his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second rank.	338.5538395238047
Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Tréville	424.9043375255725
and the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,	332.74306986500596
after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from	440.8189615563547
the lawyer’s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less	477.29627396856984
with Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.	399.25971543845185
An old proverb says, “Like master, like man.” Let us pass, then, from	297.8048863385418
the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton.	304.82136078870235
Mousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had	292.4999334885051
changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton. He had	330.2023685269661
entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be	351.16041309391903
clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two	356.16304365763204
hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would	437.0694276265998
provide for his other wants. Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing	389.29023434097445
suited him wonderfully well. He had doublets cut out of his old clothes	331.5553475797166
and cast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent	360.3770131011196
tailor, who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and	327.3071041049476
whose wife was suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his	433.3765789806615
aristocratic habits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending	322.5370847111281
on his master.	356.53478881023966
As for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the	403.5903812710532
character—a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be	415.24207122711914
able to follow in its development—his lackey was called Bazin. Thanks	377.1619638543475
to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into	320.93832185004743
orders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of a	341.1470829253707
churchman. He was a Berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,	487.0309177612708
peaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the	419.5354420023111
perusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few	360.52905664272043
dishes, but excellent. For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and	399.1976773290694
of unimpeachable fidelity.	482.9507248812258
And now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the	373.9723137110299
masters and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by	450.57057091144037
each of them.	366.55744260141597
Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou, within two steps of the Luxembourg. His	393.97644554737633
apartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a	329.7688691386906
furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really	459.9346757285092
handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. Some fragments of past	341.8348233826617
splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;	347.1933016757673
a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to	463.2281265743541
the times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with	330.8618845036912
precious stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which,	479.56219335535206
nevertheless, in his moments of greatest distress Athos had never	450.1396053518248
pledged or offered for sale. It had long been an object of ambition for	360.9188891918041
Porthos. Porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this	408.7875940104375
sword.	343.70055243257866
One day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even	461.5265853208484
to borrow it of Athos. Athos, without saying anything, emptied his	462.9412546693958
pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold	343.3991249653334
chains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said	366.16705790441324
it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master	385.413959784383
should himself quit his lodgings. In addition to the sword, there was a	410.43027083520894
portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry III., dressed with	402.1891811891101
the greatest elegance, and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost; and	350.48235453676836
this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos, certain	416.15132310283786
family likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of	318.9011615353193
the Order of the King, was his ancestor.	425.42725267827126
Besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as	306.58448349233026
the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the	307.9989896333361
mantelpiece, and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. Athos	424.43366754206727
always carried the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened	402.2709217847024
it before Porthos, and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained	369.97118833917136
nothing but letters and papers—love letters and family papers, no	488.3758573849807
doubt.	453.1031512540373
Porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous	490.6404020921324
appearance, in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier. Every time he passed with a	335.9699514917265
friend before his windows, at one of which Mousqueton was sure to be	366.81833411141855
placed in full livery, Porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,	478.9035257493989
“That is my abode!” But he was never to be found at home; he never	320.49065076827566
invited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of	443.38182726552
what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.	384.5747407517038
As to Aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an	374.43478950469455
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were,	415.03053543348744
on the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady	302.47454532599295
and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.	312.4701765841327
With regard to D’Artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have	454.7254868842555
already made acquaintance with his lackey, Master Planchet.	457.19283754882565
D’Artagnan, who was by nature very curious—as people generally are who	423.3273341883264
possess the genius of intrigue—did all he could to make out who Athos,	375.3605532943687
Porthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of	412.2497683948101
these young men concealed his family name)—Athos in particular, who, a	393.33257630913204
league away, savored of nobility. He addressed himself then to Porthos	330.43363554308513
to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis, and to Aramis in order	448.530411430654
to learn something of Porthos.	328.40429553774743
Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion	483.3295239975376
but what revealed itself. It was said Athos had met with great crosses	472.8518619937532
in love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life	328.6871264825153
of this gallant man. What could this treachery be? All the world was	306.67184860635496
ignorant of it.	470.8254716021363
As to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his	481.5350559784163
two comrades), his life was very easily known. Vain and indiscreet, it	445.2111843248488
was as easy to see through him as through a crystal. The only thing to	404.57409386228716
mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things	463.01292005118364
he said of himself.	455.7997395530705
With respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret	354.3612429536371
about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little	297.6378606619039
to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the	401.1528686496771
report which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a	376.8304248989857
princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures	352.947560413516
of his interlocutor. “And you, my dear companion,” said he, “you speak	347.3415028991403
of the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?”	405.99005920051326
“_Pardieu!_ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself,	328.62415878582584
because he had paraded all these fine things before me. But be assured,	342.38633448405955
my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, that if I had obtained them from any other	393.94938275525334
source, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor	360.1374774329606
more discreet than myself.”	294.11952955810324
“Oh, I don’t doubt that,” replied D’Artagnan; “but it seems to me that	468.48943554497134
you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms—a certain embroidered	398.86485747494424
handkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your	457.3457817430019
acquaintance?”	459.89736390094544
This time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and	334.9115098158654
replied in a friendly tone, “My dear friend, do not forget that I wish	318.39184118842496
to belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities.	443.15503869384156
The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been	385.620437201149
forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends. I was obliged to	405.38879169945466
pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. As for	373.33105603453157
myself, I neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in	322.4224252020001
that respect the very judicious example of Athos, who has none any more	392.9817570872955
than I have.”	448.94018308015904
“But what the devil! You are not a priest, you are a Musketeer!”	422.04005786987113
“A Musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a Musketeer	302.5110146009385
against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. Athos and	322.4922812513834
Porthos dragged me into this to occupy me. I had, at the moment of	409.1836593677445
being ordained, a little difficulty with—But that would not interest	465.7337800670288
you, and I am taking up your valuable time.”	451.21912536338596
“Not at all; it interests me very much,” cried D’Artagnan; “and at this	315.0466210783
moment I have absolutely nothing to do.”	355.1808500953475
“Yes, but I have my breviary to repeat,” answered Aramis; “then some	386.97860187327996
verses to compose, which Madame d’Aiguillon begged of me. Then I must	303.8955982398541
go to the Rue St. Honoré in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de	482.90572937589354
Chevreuse. So you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry,	310.89849675932766
I am very much in a hurry.”	489.8888640376141
Aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion,	355.3593521867735
and took leave of him.	423.3487964742676
Notwithstanding all the pains he took, D’Artagnan was unable to learn	359.16880804940206
any more concerning his three new-made friends. He formed, therefore,	445.1132045493854
the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their	410.72924204117726
past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future.	342.213446608148
In the meanwhile, he looked upon Athos as an Achilles, Porthos as an	387.26390467370743
Ajax, and Aramis as a Joseph.	348.67811041839775
As to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.	357.1119118393068
Athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. Nevertheless, he never	484.81227627558246
borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their	405.7417415790111
service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his	355.97395171211946
creditor by six o’clock the next morning to pay the debt of the	314.7641046257779
preceding evening.	433.69566137710024
Porthos had his fits. On the days when he won he was insolent and	484.4720651692244
ostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely for several days,	456.62507696348666
after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with	358.61332689003774
money in his purse.	348.01799250092193
As to Aramis, he never played. He was the worst Musketeer and the most	476.3812632251853
unconvivial companion imaginable. He had always something or other to	363.4466038784665
do. Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the	328.80385330401253
attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had	467.7764636552648
two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked	437.5128182648449
at his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company,	459.3520778938331
to go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an	378.2411334292228
appointment. At other times he would return home to write a treatise,	385.4152386276389
and requested his friends not to disturb him.	422.40142099073205
At this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which	312.34376770816914
so became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that	316.0883378332061
Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_.	460.4066979453247
Planchet, D’Artagnan’s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. He	437.1554518694982
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his	397.4212018041547
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. When the	475.6028020515935
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des	345.51933275859756
Fossoyeurs—that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII.	437.78966366519
were consumed or nearly so—he commenced complaints which Athos thought	396.8718462037368
nauseous, Porthos indecent, and Aramis ridiculous. Athos counseled	476.65242101559
D’Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of the opinion that he	373.39329810060553
should give him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a	318.5000225116927
master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.	451.73474015747087
“This is all very easy for you to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “for you,	301.0833402989759
Athos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak,	315.77896328676235
and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos,	421.8548884462623
who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your	327.91337196796894
valet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your	326.1611518326769
theological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious	450.8971159717803
man, with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled	359.55153281756884
means and without resources—for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even	410.68196829109775
a Guardsman, what am I to do to inspire either the affection, the	303.55757601046895
terror, or the respect in Planchet?”	388.73290954926733
“This is serious,” answered the three friends; “it is a family affair.	342.0193781134831
It is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the	442.8538527071475
footing in which you wish them to remain. Reflect upon it.”	302.6279474981921
D’Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally;	341.868466758097
which he did with the conscientiousness that D’Artagnan carried into	319.8317333158465
everything. After having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his	430.1177590857328
service without his permission. “For,” added he, “the future cannot	411.96384046755827
fail to mend; I inevitably look for better times. Your fortune is	439.7116312927252
therefore made if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to	359.77071097969065
allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you	303.0636691353861
require.”	463.52796681785514
This manner of acting roused much respect for D’Artagnan’s policy among	402.2064571717594
the Musketeers. Planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said	374.12669108654165
no more about going away.	436.93498039562303
The life of the four young men had become fraternal. D’Artagnan, who	309.6024718903072
had no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the	309.18545314957504
midst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his	396.0769942074157
friends.	461.2820830524849
They rose about eight o’clock in the winter, about six in summer, and	397.8520952196125
went to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de	402.8520935136364
Tréville’s. D’Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the	381.6691056916967
duty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he	424.1590490803285
always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was	487.68483250509644
well known at the Hôtel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered	311.14481345008096
him a good comrade. M. de Tréville, who had appreciated him at the	465.8044291829324
first glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased	319.70613996465744
recommending him to the king.	459.8148688016386
On their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young	353.7446566795555
comrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they	326.9839829069124
felt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling,	412.08196336056193
business, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one	389.05712825468623
another like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met	406.14418072841454
with seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice,	375.18342198231267
or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg.	423.82755869414746
In the meanwhile the promises of M. de Tréville went on prosperously.	301.3486481968089
One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit	446.45090772148023
D’Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D’Artagnan, with a	482.83154845574677
sigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a	371.3716438551754
Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de	292.80473405044745
Tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years—a novitiate	386.17049510306254
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself	376.40958970352517
for D’Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish	346.01556868441963
himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise D’Artagnan	386.1055991742453
withdrew, and the next day he began service.	438.5121823416942
Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard	455.2667814945348
with D’Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier	379.7863714756371
Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted	434.96502294833476
D’Artagnan.	436.1096327449953
Chapter VIII.	442.1540237749904
CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE	469.51899530542244
In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII., like all other	309.6096305579475
things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and	411.32531269180504
after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At	476.7481268883009
first, Athos supported the association for a time with his own means.	446.32152537041543
Porthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to	421.73932325792384
which he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all	365.13016654344653
for a fortnight. At last it became Aramis’s turn, who performed it with	447.8071385577583
a good grace and who succeeded—as he said, by selling some theological	322.9917057017488
books—in procuring a few pistoles.	480.5801774148813
Then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de	347.4322666467676
Tréville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could	340.9980140152735
not go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a	357.7231563710725
Guardsman who as yet had no pay at all.	407.35208390977164
At length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they	413.7245870590631
got together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which	471.03301600154225
Porthos went to the gaming table. Unfortunately he was in a bad vein;	401.91526525627626
he lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given	299.20000952266764
his word.	373.75340467146907
Then the inconvenience became distress. The hungry friends, followed by	307.8841363558961
their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking up	475.7597928901258
among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for	368.2913683406079
according to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right	443.39441980762035
and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.	396.8577759407792
Athos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their	471.83397670165687
lackeys with him. Porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same	340.1144354388359
manner that his friends should partake of them; Aramis had eight of	345.9414902756008
them. He was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but	474.1441930731837
little noise, and yet was much sought after.	415.19804738130404
As to D’Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found	409.8171441022339
one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,	444.9958077827113
and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards. He took his army	344.9726414117641
to the priest’s, where they devoured as much provision as would have	298.44494238983543
lasted him for two months, and to the cornet’s, who performed wonders;	301.35748016809225
but as Planchet said, “People do not eat at once for all time, even	436.5346347254954
when they eat a good deal.”	317.99218550574295
D’Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one	458.9709022668824
meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest’s	459.7335140851866
could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which	366.2067142611328
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis had procured him. He fancied himself a	375.1445569898479
burden to the society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith	322.25519489342946
that he had fed this society for a month; and he set his mind actively	384.6960400383525
to work. He reflected that this coalition of four young, brave,	447.2653583339787
enterprising, and active men ought to have some other object than	445.64765534745277
swaggering walks, fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less	383.2689561435154
witty.	380.57418573668167
In fact, four men such as they were—four men devoted to one another,	323.26154259564396
from their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one	470.36743407759553
another, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions	319.41235071109276
formed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or	415.98136183817195
turning toward a single point—must inevitably, either subterraneously,	321.8759233723886
in open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open	398.06381418834985
themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well	481.82312235417226
it might be defended, or however distant it may seem. The only thing	431.33528482873226
that astonished D’Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of	391.4552041132522
this.	303.33650451279254
He was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to	418.1762135636019
find a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with	313.56051017642307
which he did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought,	366.2952419162102
they should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at	457.3595399164741
his door. D’Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it.	364.8282955527258
From this phrase, “D’Artagnan awakened Planchet,” the reader must not	435.4182184128256
suppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. No, it had just	470.7502675077647
struck four. Planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for some	315.95157844981986
dinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, “He who sleeps,	491.17299458412833
dines.” And Planchet dined by sleeping.	385.8339024425263
A man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a	472.4100464204363
tradesman. Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the	368.77196099611797
conversation; but the citizen declared to D’Artagnan that, what he had	333.48012003666065
to say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone	440.2741214403769
with him.	477.8265883913717
D’Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.	368.01319500184866
There was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each	325.93276516955365
other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which D’Artagnan	292.88899396280976
bowed, as a sign that he listened.	451.9840557928308
“I have heard Monsieur d’Artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man,”	353.68013553540766
said the citizen; “and this reputation which he justly enjoys had	381.9168400466466
decided me to confide a secret to him.”	487.78564860128364
“Speak, monsieur, speak,” said D’Artagnan, who instinctively scented	340.08059532191527
something advantageous.	340.038497560505
The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, “I have a wife who is	362.21810278950494
seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either	349.6924523856047
virtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago,	329.5411101509382
although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the	392.49594002205527
queen’s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.”	383.27517300650334
“Well, monsieur?” asked D’Artagnan.	328.2621778338394
“Well!” resumed the citizen, “well, monsieur, my wife was abducted	350.13373944053893
yesterday morning, as she was coming out of her workroom.”	399.56324209365306
“And by whom was your wife abducted?”	478.260567778506
“I know nothing surely, monsieur, but I suspect someone.”	404.3193307201691
“And who is the person whom you suspect?”	392.6109564847843
“A man who has pursued her a long time.”	482.32864662303575
“The devil!”	448.21174692939337
“But allow me to tell you, monsieur,” continued the citizen, “that I am	383.0798391186936
convinced that there is less love than politics in all this.”	348.57734075316336
“Less love than politics,” replied D’Artagnan, with a reflective air;	461.82899736453453
“and what do you suspect?”	482.007257275503
“I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.”	469.41856033302616
“Monsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing. It	365.6635977118173
is you who have come to me. It is you who have told me that you had a	410.8769992868599
secret to confide in me. Act, then, as you think proper; there is still	425.00183476740153
time to withdraw.”	295.41041586395056
“No, monsieur, no; you appear to be an honest young man, and I will	296.9983500919599
have confidence in you. I believe, then, that it is not on account of	466.45446903139225
any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of	358.541081142958
those of a lady much greater than herself.”	305.49335093734857
“Ah, ah! Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de Bois-Tracy?”	350.935430388437
said D’Artagnan, wishing to have the air, in the eyes of the citizen,	483.496287877486
of being posted as to court affairs.	307.03375212970377
“Higher, monsieur, higher.”	411.70431680305717
“Of Madame d’Aiguillon?”	401.29225163608237
“Still higher.”	464.80865322347074
“Of Madame de Chevreuse?”	328.3361973376214
“Higher, much higher.”	397.7014680683749
“Of the—” D’Artagnan checked himself.	436.802037181363
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the terrified citizen, in a tone so low that	322.8653836982677
he was scarcely audible.	315.7869483268946
“And with whom?”	394.34909071752804
“With whom can it be, if not the Duke of—”	311.9922546159294
“The Duke of—”	326.91771505919917
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the citizen, giving a still fainter intonation	381.4450282325213
to his voice.	383.9924261624626
“But how do you know all this?”	463.36811405839177
“How do I know it?”	394.25120921934774
“Yes, how do you know it? No half-confidence, or—you understand!”	380.5129626323938
“I know it from my wife, monsieur—from my wife herself.”	430.2421563870065
“Who learns it from whom?”	339.08959599628724
“From Monsieur Laporte. Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter	379.6622873866395
of Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen? Well, Monsieur	322.5785743159103
Laporte placed her near her Majesty in order that our poor queen might	482.61482136761913
at least have someone in whom she could place confidence, abandoned as	488.690388344431
she is by the king, watched as she is by the cardinal, betrayed as she	338.0103321448598
is by everybody.”	399.1320230619647
“Ah, ah! It begins to develop itself,” said D’Artagnan.	301.90996730937877
“Now, my wife came home four days ago, monsieur. One of her conditions	410.1975489391335
was that she should come and see me twice a week; for, as I had the	456.35325454873686
honor to tell you, my wife loves me dearly—my wife, then, came and	404.4650591631241
confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great	384.59904230003053
fears.”	309.2503585804395
“Truly!”	392.5442070104944
“Yes. The cardinal, as it appears, pursues her and persecutes her more	348.4030361949593
than ever. He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband. You know	406.31977607605904
the history of the Saraband?”	445.8794132718825
“_Pardieu!_ Know it!” replied D’Artagnan, who knew nothing about it,	351.961884536219
but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on.	394.78477573527533
“So that now it is no longer hatred, but vengeance.”	390.4136560988905
“Indeed!”	479.28512792884084
“And the queen believes—”	471.5446064068316
“Well, what does the queen believe?”	354.470985658234
“She believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her	403.24315255529865
name.”	478.404768632593
“In the queen’s name?”	473.5245337652568
“Yes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw	398.75705702816964
him into some snare.”	327.0198937678833
“The devil! But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?”	406.7572271235794
“Her devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her	412.6616177366898
from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her	480.8237618307138
Majesty’s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.”	430.71774947533316
“That is likely,” said D’Artagnan; “but the man who has abducted her—do	402.15898483931596
you know him?”	399.4731363205917
“I have told you that I believe I know him.”	479.61298729537396
“His name?”	405.53239520233365
“I do not know that; what I do know is that he is a creature of the	323.3120196403126
cardinal, his evil genius.”	419.8247057231697
“But you have seen him?”	483.4925976378454
“Yes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.”	341.4583623539485
“Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?”	469.7399366060194
“Oh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair,	460.1636974434225
swarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his	477.90876537038343
temple.”	401.066167402213
“A scar on his temple!” cried D’Artagnan; “and with that, white teeth,	392.8090363066724
a piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage—why,	344.48712504716315
that’s my man of Meung.”	445.4991161536392
“He is your man, do you say?”	379.08403361282933
“Yes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it. No, I am wrong. On the	428.4294867828977
contrary, that simplifies the matter greatly. If your man is mine, with	430.9991257191217
one blow I shall obtain two revenges, that’s all; but where to find	460.77837508982446
this man?”	397.88649679749085
“I know not.”	397.47558884768745
“Have you no information as to his abiding place?”	484.42505691868337
“None. One day, as I was conveying my wife back to the Louvre, he was	297.0463623613515
coming out as she was going in, and she showed him to me.”	377.06268952193324
“The devil! The devil!” murmured D’Artagnan; “all this is vague enough.	455.78318997808213
From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife?”	439.62241957748824
“From Monsieur Laporte.”	379.21559325389705
“Did he give you any details?”	328.4432478394249
“He knew none himself.”	490.97742309914435
“And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?”	332.2038157703529
“Yes, I have received—”	482.4866935227197
“What?”	319.4163555283485
“I fear I am committing a great imprudence.”	458.76884965629495
“You always come back to that; but I must make you see this time that	473.0699642514667
it is too late to retreat.”	421.394380521102
“I do not retreat, _mordieu!_” cried the citizen, swearing in order to	403.6171059769879
rouse his courage. “Besides, by the faith of Bonacieux—”	394.175305208164
“You call yourself Bonacieux?” interrupted D’Artagnan.	426.7205823848633
“Yes, that is my name.”	462.74958549157736
“You said, then, by the word of Bonacieux. Pardon me for interrupting	298.9623945973592
you, but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me.”	479.07027026076526
“Possibly, monsieur. I am your landlord.”	293.4574935950764
“Ah, ah!” said D’Artagnan, half rising and bowing; “you are my	465.30802005436715
landlord?”	312.13709351352236
“Yes, monsieur, yes. And as it is three months since you have been	313.6953270092578
here, and though, distracted as you must be in your important	369.5054719496312
occupations, you have forgotten to pay me my rent—as, I say, I have not	325.1612866191876
tormented you a single instant, I thought you would appreciate my	457.8917117680153
delicacy.”	391.57566440054404
“How can it be otherwise, my dear Bonacieux?” replied D’Artagnan;	392.7265108372201
“trust me, I am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct, and if,	461.06079967383675
as I told you, I can be of any service to you—”	453.6218853900235
“I believe you, monsieur, I believe you; and as I was about to say, by	434.2880191144677
the word of Bonacieux, I have confidence in you.”	476.3820400170707
“Finish, then, what you were about to say.”	382.4473326307833
The citizen took a paper from his pocket, and presented it to	328.5350248865223
D’Artagnan.	315.39028054132393
“A letter?” said the young man.	312.86261394895
“Which I received this morning.”	415.44554450335477
D’Artagnan opened it, and as the day was beginning to decline, he	394.2342460124183
approached the window to read it. The citizen followed him.	403.63696052751345
“‘Do not seek your wife,’” read D’Artagnan; “‘she will be restored to	463.41920191081863
you when there is no longer occasion for her. If you make a single step	388.1902124802417
to find her you are lost.’	298.88826335245943
“That’s pretty positive,” continued D’Artagnan; “but after all, it is	445.6960055535913
but a menace.”	335.6382932262958
“Yes; but that menace terrifies me. I am not a fighting man at all,	451.0366920737003
monsieur, and I am afraid of the Bastille.”	459.00807786667195
“Hum!” said D’Artagnan. “I have no greater regard for the Bastille than	305.06313274017117
you. If it were nothing but a sword thrust, why then—”	376.670960022083
“I have counted upon you on this occasion, monsieur.”	473.6134601408387
“Yes?”	418.04979819180835
“Seeing you constantly surrounded by Musketeers of a very superb	410.5850825919744
appearance, and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de	452.937878058832
Tréville, and were consequently enemies of the cardinal, I thought that	416.17823747299263
you and your friends, while rendering justice to your poor queen, would	432.41413879778514
be pleased to play his Eminence an ill turn.”	452.81313278145217
“Without doubt.”	428.93807595639134
“And then I have thought that considering three months’ lodging, about	408.36043622028393
which I have said nothing—”	447.0053329960177
“Yes, yes; you have already given me that reason, and I find it	433.1338706767691
excellent.”	322.74862352123694
“Reckoning still further, that as long as you do me the honor to remain	393.9383386430252
in my house I shall never speak to you about rent—”	335.9813249294301
“Very kind!”	454.5768300321309
“And adding to this, if there be need of it, meaning to offer you fifty	351.9805237828504
pistoles, if, against all probability, you should be short at the	448.154715388617
present moment.”	332.5405415040713
“Admirable! You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?”	320.14541341843267
“I am comfortably off, monsieur, that’s all; I have scraped together	422.41560284157856
some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the	356.92911613834224
haberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in	310.3720442663114
the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you	480.37443050796776
understand, monsieur—But!—” cried the citizen.	442.81698602754534
“What!” demanded D’Artagnan.	438.02546578037504
“Whom do I see yonder?”	343.3686101755532
“Where?”	295.6184193579385
“In the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door—a man	400.8995548761876
wrapped in a cloak.”	307.85842111676527
“It is he!” cried D’Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each	328.9599059418966
having recognized his man.	348.93596446060985
“Ah, this time,” cried D’Artagnan, springing to his sword, “this time	430.1315087412014
he will not escape me!”	451.9097773882128
Drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On	433.20048739601293
the staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him.	304.3407687075678
They separated, and D’Artagnan rushed between them like a dart.	370.8567954018134
“Pah! Where are you going?” cried the two Musketeers in a breath.	382.1444552921705
“The man of Meung!” replied D’Artagnan, and disappeared.	438.02589589847173
D’Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with	478.8879696215972
the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to	485.28346234988027
whom this man had confided some important missive.	440.19122373886677
The opinion of Athos was that D’Artagnan had lost his letter in the	433.8040461114029
skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion—and according to D’Artagnan’s	468.9651517586367
portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman—would be incapable of	424.85720545112355
the baseness of stealing a letter.	475.4901407906517
Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to	478.50879676778936
a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the	327.461953688903
presence of D’Artagnan and his yellow horse.	471.4802783988624
Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was	448.5476606984687
better not to fathom them.	371.13635610681393
They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from	460.24551432729163
D’Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that	374.89175912273464
overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, D’Artagnan would return to	362.7425008019946
his rooms, they kept on their way.	400.7452507298076
When they entered D’Artagnan’s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,	398.1649615208131
dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to	313.8917576574278
take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with	356.0806343440431
the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.	328.6418774368038
Chapter IX.	456.44292800974324
D’ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF	364.31849605616003
As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,	316.6229693511151
D’Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared	409.1371475292408
as if by enchantment. D’Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all	337.7491915592522
the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he	424.6025307894177
sought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to	400.17595550460516
have begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the	436.5296056556262
stranger had leaned; but this proved useless—for though he knocked ten	319.43418921904225
or twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the	299.81060417631835
neighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to	333.9776129679994
their doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the	355.3717709686124
openings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six	321.38522132656294
months.	340.9876473324965
While D’Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors,	479.90692604956234
Aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home D’Artagnan	435.7018719516793
found the reunion complete.	369.40639124943885
“Well!” cried the three Musketeers all together, on seeing D’Artagnan	472.05235381632065
enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset	446.6181761514154
with anger.	312.2388435389918
“Well!” cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, “this man must be	327.38732808909026
the devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade,	302.8330641902268
like a specter.”	482.77883756600244
“Do you believe in apparitions?” asked Athos of Porthos.	417.4731048531041
“I never believe in anything I have not seen, and as I never have seen	452.13408819679694
apparitions, I don’t believe in them.”	431.7316977540558
“The Bible,” said Aramis, “makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of	423.89294404751183
Samuel appeared to Saul, and it is an article of faith that I should be	363.65534652165127
very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, Porthos.”	453.142759049334
“At all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this	459.966453564537
man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a	337.5227614142914
glorious affair, gentlemen—an affair by which there were a hundred	352.0862989257176
pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained.”	394.5878723225692
“How is that?” cried Porthos and Aramis in a breath.	392.85808621342625
As to Athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself	456.9142977665549
with interrogating D’Artagnan by a look.	299.6504218165137
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated	346.5029293990993
his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of	445.9878166499892
the conversation, “go down to my landlord, Monsieur Bonacieux, and ask	479.99397787852354
him to send me half a dozen bottles of Beaugency wine; I prefer that.”	421.53868766043286
“Ah, ah! You have credit with your landlord, then?” asked Porthos.	443.8274422813678
“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan, “from this very day; and mind, if the wine	448.66622688773907
is bad, we will send him to find better.”	350.82373143845365
“We must use, and not abuse,” said Aramis, sententiously.	440.8516525879305
“I always said that D’Artagnan had the longest head of the four,” said	463.1075508728178
Athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which D’Artagnan replied	349.9888051647512
with a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.	390.6446494920926
“But come, what is this about?” asked Porthos.	307.81995990723107
“Yes,” said Aramis, “impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor	344.29717255501885
of any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do	320.58399261135554
better to keep it to yourself.”	402.23198462070155
“Be satisfied,” replied D’Artagnan; “the honor of no one will have	445.4022178770689
cause to complain of what I have to tell.”	456.68632085485035
He then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed	325.2497431713071
between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of	416.2216280263226
his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at	312.1089018138834
the hostelry of the Jolly Miller.	475.3605171618574
“Your affair is not bad,” said Athos, after having tasted like a	379.08297623703027
connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine	422.55440207751565
good; “and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man.	415.3492482242191
Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty	405.43636972548035
pistoles are worth the risk of four heads.”	330.64558869545283
“But observe,” cried D’Artagnan, “that there is a woman in the affair—a	392.61505619489424
woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured	461.97799103077625
perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress.”	471.0498435336866
“Beware, D’Artagnan, beware,” said Aramis. “You grow a little too warm,	428.5218961985328
in my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux. Woman was created	453.2900874655048
for our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries.”	361.3765375764964
At this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit	321.72849036526776
his lips.	389.93620149639173
“It is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious,” cried D’Artagnan,	351.7466910740688
“but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes,	446.5968924361905
and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other.”	390.0958234677796
“Why does she love what we hate most in the world, the Spaniards and	405.087817814684
the English?”	400.11072611595836
“Spain is her country,” replied D’Artagnan; “and it is very natural	373.91173407425305
that she should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil	482.884179447874
as herself. As to the second reproach, I have heard it said that she	294.789697806236
does not love the English, but an Englishman.”	479.78906675867916
“Well, and by my faith,” said Athos, “it must be acknowledged that this	488.9909512695976
Englishman is worthy of being loved. I never saw a man with a nobler	437.49917856314903
air than his.”	416.9070421653354
“Without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can,” said Porthos.	325.30188441244513
“I was at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and,	426.3491652313232
_pardieu_, I picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each. Do you	308.03037807699644
know him, Aramis?”	300.99572196723346
“As well as you do, gentlemen; for I was among those who seized him in	375.1330743498731
the garden at Amiens, into which Monsieur Putange, the queen’s equerry,	365.89304975632797
introduced me. I was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared	317.7549205187824
to me to be cruel for the king.”	430.01028820131484
“Which would not prevent me,” said D’Artagnan, “if I knew where the	370.570247773148
Duke of Buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him	472.8989257504411
to the queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find	437.43484211552146
means to play him a sharp turn, I vow that I would voluntarily risk my	306.3398434246628
head in doing it.”	406.2523197236518
“And did the mercer*,” rejoined Athos, “tell you, D’Artagnan, that the	343.7056682102751
queen thought that Buckingham had been brought over by a forged	451.9287435545067
letter?”	409.2642101851291
* Haberdasher	415.49242671091923
“She is afraid so.”	399.80638773892707
“Wait a minute, then,” said Aramis.	414.9414997874479
“What for?” demanded Porthos.	393.5582743166449
“Go on, while I endeavor to recall circumstances.”	436.8378081083871
“And now I am convinced,” said D’Artagnan, “that this abduction of the	312.3232287212203
queen’s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking,	320.1351491323219
and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in Paris.”	480.02735514887854
“The Gascon is full of ideas,” said Porthos, with admiration.	481.85275453569943
“I like to hear him talk,” said Athos; “his dialect amuses me.”	401.4228309155026
“Gentlemen,” cried Aramis, “listen to this.”	408.14133672726683
“Listen to Aramis,” said his three friends.	467.4462443750265
“Yesterday I was at the house of a doctor of theology, whom I sometimes	449.04116678039816
consult about my studies.”	417.39035503407626
Athos smiled.	424.77176046278527
“He resides in a quiet quarter,” continued Aramis; “his tastes and his	317.3544334141205
profession require it. Now, at the moment when I left his house—”	490.8811346130538
Here Aramis paused.	366.9317774847333
“Well,” cried his auditors; “at the moment you left his house?”	306.8424869690627
Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the	408.96455811673934
full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen	425.48792733199895
obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,	345.0976485011075
their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.	310.6324296234169
“This doctor has a niece,” continued Aramis.	471.8100892934591
“Ah, he has a niece!” interrupted Porthos.	415.08663818561
“A very respectable lady,” said Aramis.	418.1451690465824
The three friends burst into laughter.	354.1522464320329
“Ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me,” replied Aramis, “you shall know	422.3746651685003
nothing.”	455.2329460286827
“We believe like Mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones,” said	451.4607855762822
Athos.	447.3503588153155
“I will continue, then,” resumed Aramis. “This niece comes sometimes to	411.87617821343855
see her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that	376.03740595479826
I was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage.”	303.9838661854074
“Ah! She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?” interrupted	401.7881539200358
Porthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. “A nice	351.6416622620255
acquaintance, my friend!”	468.9005649360696
“Porthos,” replied Aramis, “I have had the occasion to observe to you	342.0030823030118
more than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to	343.3638289782553
you among the women.”	435.2933784826008
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” cried D’Artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of	304.2266300137797
the result of the adventure, “the thing is serious. Let us try not to	462.58741334941067
jest, if we can. Go on Aramis, go on.”	323.58235299568634
“All at once, a tall, dark gentleman—just like yours, D’Artagnan.”	316.853221165743
“The same, perhaps,” said he.	423.0190376849928
“Possibly,” continued Aramis, “came toward me, accompanied by five or	486.62682490527635
six men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest	406.12946718536926
tone, ‘Monsieur Duke,’ said he to me, ‘and you madame,’ continued he,	450.54541762640514
addressing the lady on my arm—”	315.9749543424169
“The doctor’s niece?”	457.7166904972042
“Hold your tongue, Porthos,” said Athos; “you are insupportable.”	384.00025433964913
“‘—will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least	322.93174633982346
resistance, without making the least noise?’”	331.0610875985418
“He took you for Buckingham!” cried D’Artagnan.	421.8873666963841
“I believe so,” replied Aramis.	360.7298385146966
“But the lady?” asked Porthos.	482.56750255380643
“He took her for the queen!” said D’Artagnan.	456.4239668203637
“Just so,” replied Aramis.	451.74236463533146
“The Gascon is the devil!” cried Athos; “nothing escapes him.”	353.242386552607
“The fact is,” said Porthos, “Aramis is of the same height, and	413.32322073212833
something of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me	338.0368647525048
that the dress of a Musketeer—”	316.2456217352672
“I wore an enormous cloak,” said Aramis.	350.20538090741445
“In the month of July? The devil!” said Porthos. “Is the doctor afraid	405.351537308479
that you may be recognized?”	297.56234819463043
“I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person;	323.44726444972997
but the face—”	402.96007756614983
“I had a large hat,” said Aramis.	375.323376578913
“Oh, good lord,” cried Porthos, “what precautions for the study of	397.472070025147
theology!”	319.16750268757045
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “do not let us lose our time	437.2708967628871
in jesting. Let us separate, and let us seek the mercer’s wife—that is	348.0634885338836
the key of the intrigue.”	447.9790151176335
“A woman of such inferior condition! Can you believe so?” said Porthos,	372.8571103687684
protruding his lips with contempt.	480.36530006732335
“She is goddaughter to Laporte, the confidential valet of the queen.	478.74249906162584
Have I not told you so, gentlemen? Besides, it has perhaps been her	441.56545967935267
Majesty’s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly.	330.97704242072496
High heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is	358.44292417290285
longsighted.”	353.03090015231624
“Well,” said Porthos, “in the first place make a bargain with the	296.40026362998213
mercer, and a good bargain.”	322.01273346005934
“That’s useless,” said D’Artagnan; “for I believe if he does not pay	410.32183934081115
us, we shall be well enough paid by another party.”	370.97152988699037
At this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs;	426.89733243392857
the door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed	352.6425279871345
into the chamber in which the council was held.	348.05656778209374
“Save me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!” cried he. “There	420.6218643760704
are four men come to arrest me. Save me! Save me!”	461.02323786119086
Porthos and Aramis arose.	426.08567442973816
“A moment,” cried D’Artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the	487.1976776144723
scabbard their half-drawn swords. “It is not courage that is needed; it	342.3222366069849
is prudence.”	300.1263661864298
“And yet,” cried Porthos, “we will not leave—”	306.2899123366413
“You will leave D’Artagnan to act as he thinks proper,” said Athos. “He	423.78592238047725
has, I repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part I declare	295.005521695369
that I will obey him. Do as you think best, D’Artagnan.”	347.44076636385154
At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,	316.3394278606776
but seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,	333.89303578840935
they hesitated about going farther.	314.9146213477036
“Come in, gentlemen, come in,” called D’Artagnan; “you are here in my	407.0003736822823
apartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal.”	397.43467489412166
“Then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have	407.841712985079
received?” asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.	381.6975012495625
“On the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary.”	348.4878530360933
“What does he say?” grumbled Porthos.	303.88660027991824
“You are a simpleton,” said Athos. “Silence!”	301.9229081132757
“But you promised me—” whispered the poor mercer.	386.0964453965538
“We can only save you by being free ourselves,” replied D’Artagnan, in	348.8662057709932
a rapid, low tone; “and if we appear inclined to defend you, they will	357.812283153525
arrest us with you.”	386.9852768605317
“It seems, nevertheless—”	378.37422818538687
“Come, gentlemen, come!” said D’Artagnan, aloud; “I have no motive for	414.84644563654035
defending Monsieur. I saw him today for the first time, and he can tell	364.6116944166713
you on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging. Is that	394.38182557011623
not true, Monsieur Bonacieux? Answer!”	331.0636542166017
“That is the very truth,” cried the mercer; “but Monsieur does not tell	336.5068151384543
you—”	358.1979720997378
“Silence, with respect to me, silence, with respect to my friends;	434.8103152861898
silence about the queen, above all, or you will ruin everybody without	336.88574359512086
saving yourself! Come, come, gentlemen, remove the fellow.” And	314.92528078881696
D’Artagnan pushed the half-stupefied mercer among the Guards, saying to	398.6165220985754
him, “You are a shabby old fellow, my dear. You come to demand money of	416.3662865382961
me—of a Musketeer! To prison with him! Gentlemen, once more, take him	465.4213568145159
to prison, and keep him under key as long as possible; that will give	485.4398141840079
me time to pay him.”	489.92886544707244
The officers were full of thanks, and took away their prey. As they	441.75377110332164
were going down D’Artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their	304.94107772046556
leader.	453.34838714228556
“May I not drink to your health, and you to mine?” said D’Artagnan,	382.6294997924441
filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from	338.1752420942453
the liberality of M. Bonacieux.	465.65113667711955
“That will do me great honor,” said the leader of the posse, “and I	344.8338787123749
accept thankfully.”	491.44481123092453
“Then to yours, monsieur—what is your name?”	412.5596709831974
“Boisrenard.”	420.59997777952725
“Monsieur Boisrenard.”	342.13866415950787
“To yours, my gentlemen! What is your name, in your turn, if you	417.69107173808845
please?”	478.2911939359569
“D’Artagnan.”	361.6943839423995
“To yours, monsieur.”	428.4690374947196
“And above all others,” cried D’Artagnan, as if carried away by his	451.44016798805774
enthusiasm, “to that of the king and the cardinal.”	450.09272135582114
The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of	490.6047795027606
D’Artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was	336.6724789841653
convinced.	366.23078764878125
“What diabolical villainy you have performed here,” said Porthos, when	317.3010828781355
the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found	454.4977742780364
themselves alone. “Shame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an	305.1435766913541
unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst!	370.7194695362912
And a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!”	315.4150778142398
“Porthos,” said Aramis, “Athos has already told you that you are a	424.72208483236795
simpleton, and I am quite of his opinion. D’Artagnan, you are a great	358.49898325535105
man; and when you occupy Monsieur de Tréville’s place, I will come and	382.09234622176837
ask your influence to secure me an abbey.”	331.18608074266024
“Well, I am in a maze,” said Porthos; “do _you_ approve of what	369.38986147194674
D’Artagnan has done?”	304.8256113619179
“_Parbleu!_ Indeed I do,” said Athos; “I not only approve of what he	439.27295509912125
has done, but I congratulate him upon it.”	385.3878785843888
“And now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, without stopping to explain his	344.903770598834
conduct to Porthos, “All for one, one for all—that is our motto, is it	362.8678807118106
not?”	420.60556776500437
“And yet—” said Porthos.	337.2040240078661
“Hold out your hand and swear!” cried Athos and Aramis at once.	453.8308495461706
Overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos	333.34971223678514
stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice	376.67967707845617
the formula dictated by D’Artagnan:	489.4296864523525
“All for one, one for all.”	381.95572383627143
“That’s well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,” said	487.45955554236036
D’Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; “and	360.2559216747194
attention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.”	323.71126969979525
Chapter X.	422.8163046384867
A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY	377.6000043324111
The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as	295.9000425960102
societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police	404.22815128318126
invented mousetraps.	341.2269307520968
As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de	468.7043911638815
Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for	337.6887726838208
the first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a	458.444807170951
mousetrap.	420.9175557337308
When in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of	489.85333104977985
any crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are	480.8735872643105
placed in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who	428.12237206334146
knock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the	361.8037199832069
end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the	373.577189205146
_habitués_ of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap.	339.6185888348854
The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever	335.9354361679752
appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal’s people. It	311.0851982486136
must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in	369.8067913715943
which D’Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from	458.62757558645285
this detention.	364.5965634699872
Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all	360.93338488161254
been engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered	396.6204962454788
nothing. Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Tréville—a	444.1397896088365
thing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy	472.3489927511058
Musketeer, had very much astonished his captain. But M. de Tréville	350.89885481493513
knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the	391.42549136284515
king, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king	385.7574140366273
uneasy, and the redness of the queen’s eyes donated that she had been	459.99342861199943
sleepless or tearful. But this last circumstance was not striking, as	380.3011421841428
the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much.	462.2670508786787
M. de Tréville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant	430.9967770270515
of his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to	432.32609258473263
convey his desires to his comrades.	366.6676888791176
As to D’Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his	480.13425860702694
chamber into an observatory. From his windows he saw all the visitors	396.4683558647157
who were caught. Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and	454.43192031086903
nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room	432.2997223032406
beneath, in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that	333.0039563146721
passed between the inquisitors and the accused.	451.8205229570734
The interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the	415.90869722592254
persons arrested, were almost always framed thus: “Has Madame Bonacieux	336.02594049631455
sent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur	350.2320728669371
Bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person?	431.9617326907444
Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?”	354.67766621557644
“If they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,”	441.2137786829198
said D’Artagnan to himself. “Now, what is it they want to know? Why,	344.5654855422847
they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has	318.419927832594
had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.”	426.96741238403234
D’Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not	417.19258427805653
wanting in probability.	465.55212250902207
In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise	411.16551198492107
D’Artagnan’s vigilance.	478.6111050690055
On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos	462.3864553304486
had just left D’Artagnan to report at M. de Tréville’s, as nine o’clock	464.0331798031019
had just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was	354.92743701249486
beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door	430.2983631362235
was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.	450.02644086655926
D’Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full	442.7983441430906
length, and listened.	320.5894073547445
Cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be	432.47776133557664
endeavoring to stifle. There were no questions.	335.34782272362145
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan to himself. “It seems like a woman! They	338.934141414804
search her; she resists; they use force—the scoundrels!”	365.8388232438551
In spite of his prudence, D’Artagnan restrained himself with great	490.81385386533486
difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.	422.7574421724896
“But I tell you that I am the mistress of the house, gentlemen! I tell	371.99400292492226
you I am Madame Bonacieux; I tell you I belong to the queen!” cried the	362.7120310261728
unfortunate woman.	381.53036176894267
“Madame Bonacieux!” murmured D’Artagnan. “Can I be so lucky as to find	476.55949907354625
what everybody is seeking for?”	296.6869991036678
The voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook	295.90668192593245
the partition. The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four	345.95472707509896
men.	476.52155217901475
“Pardon, gentlemen—par—” murmured the voice, which could now only be	474.0904727437893
heard in inarticulate sounds.	401.3907366339343
“They are binding her; they are going to drag her away,” cried	392.1567131218095
D’Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. “My sword! Good, it	361.76078578739083
is by my side! Planchet!”	440.80912475174216
“Monsieur.”	322.8529556202867
“Run and seek Athos, Porthos and Aramis. One of the three will	347.2403537504401
certainly be at home, perhaps all three. Tell them to take arms, to	467.96222466501115
come here, and to run! Ah, I remember, Athos is at Monsieur de	376.39677305386084
Tréville’s.”	302.84740132295076
“But where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?”	368.8332201109612
“I am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner,” cried	447.73408276422015
D’Artagnan. “You put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the	470.7265477428665
door, and run as I told you.”	480.48295390783403
“Oh, monsieur! Monsieur! You will kill yourself,” cried Planchet.	354.637659090379
“Hold your tongue, stupid fellow,” said D’Artagnan; and laying hold of	373.85314607526595
the casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which	363.7258158145754
fortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest	483.848222680151
injury.	318.17584566484953
He then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, “I will go	344.2082958852678
myself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that	487.22827572519907
shall pounce upon such a mouse!”	478.8560532960564
The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before	474.3383293206005
the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and	432.8901911313436
D’Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the	416.1859731392939
door of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.	456.82009832631866
Then those who dwelt in Bonacieux’s unfortunate house, together with	333.5599890400242
the nearest neighbors, heard loud cries, stamping of feet, clashing of	416.416814440238
swords, and breaking of furniture. A moment after, those who, surprised	310.16623530456565
by this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw	391.8544800524405
the door open, and four men, clothed in black, not _come_ out of it,	313.986640031333
but _fly_, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on	402.81606009648476
the corners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to	298.4700627086903
say, patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks.	370.5199121381742
D’Artagnan was conqueror—without much effort, it must be confessed, for	316.28695714873226
only one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for	484.0079817487757
form’s sake. It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock	309.862395749935
the young man down with chairs, stools, and crockery; but two or three	334.45513067944955
scratches made by the Gascon’s blade terrified them. Ten minutes	438.76892182033794
sufficed for their defeat, and D’Artagnan remained master of the field	432.05119595790495
of battle.	442.6777651002509
The neighbors who had opened their windows, with the coolness peculiar	403.41569946230857
to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and	448.79468234220394
disturbances, closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in	376.063271924049
black flee—their instinct telling them that for the time all was over.	385.53269976049455
Besides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed	384.99101561518796
early in the quarter of the Luxembourg.	472.72486079173984
On being left alone with Mme. Bonacieux, D’Artagnan turned toward her;	408.25467365050145
the poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an	478.38639819719583
armchair. D’Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance.	375.95329415851336
She was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark	444.9889913245288
hair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a	422.7291929941922
complexion marbled with rose and opal. There, however, ended the signs	315.0166899655243
which might have confounded her with a lady of rank. The hands were	389.6125670782598
white, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of	456.26488361246686
quality. Happily, D’Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.	473.0894485277462
While D’Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have	366.28743899556093
said, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief,	371.50520272234826
which he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he	362.5403917440933
recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had	292.4850615969165
nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other’s throat.	449.1480002666149
From that time, D’Artagnan had been cautious with respect to	466.1220029211713
handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket	403.82745656890796
of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up.	324.4430933072946
At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her	351.4966450638767
eyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty	310.47740858099445
and that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to	322.5096486672814
him with a smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.	378.48842804358964
“Ah, monsieur!” said she, “you have saved me; permit me to thank you.”	356.9508326099054
“Madame,” said D’Artagnan, “I have only done what every gentleman would	447.96878609799467
have done in my place; you owe me no thanks.”	372.2876117193737
“Oh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have	480.73041923557855
not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took	318.5785835796185
for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?”	345.2954562339113
“Madame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have	370.95982173644927
been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband,	408.8761731221485
Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening	459.9146232121425
conducted to the Bastille.”	360.4025869467242
“My husband in the Bastille!” cried Mme. Bonacieux. “Oh, my God! What	298.1177402194352
has he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!”	355.478327857762
And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features	361.90055705995815
of the young woman.	487.742490015911
“What has he done, madame?” said D’Artagnan. “I believe that his only	464.0613934062965
crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune	412.59371122113794
to be your husband.”	405.05437993775206
“But, monsieur, you know then—”	293.1992481284877
“I know that you have been abducted, madame.”	317.91689954704935
“And by whom? Do you know him? Oh, if you know him, tell me!”	303.45605294731587
“By a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark	468.9483957107678
complexion, and a scar on his left temple.”	315.11733247763624
“That is he, that is he; but his name?”	371.14349241084744
“Ah, his name? I do not know that.”	326.5255405348779
“And did my husband know I had been carried off?”	376.25976618509054
“He was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor	491.38551493120315
himself.”	334.5641911638954
“And does he suspect,” said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment,	483.19571140679045
“the cause of this event?”	324.7836819055724
“He attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.”	343.10296393089436
“I doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my	348.6329928819985
dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?”	465.11260561130916
“So far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above	435.6349849748111
all, of your love.”	403.67669214587033
A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the	453.75575408796976
pretty young woman.	318.29915282145305
“But,” continued D’Artagnan, “how did you escape?”	393.4950560972866
“I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had	476.25790087219474
known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the	367.49642630456003
sheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my	459.0070918753456
husband would be at home, I hastened hither.”	425.9571898537263
“To place yourself under his protection?”	293.08898375528656
“Oh, no, poor dear man! I knew very well that he was incapable of	313.5567870745011
defending me; but as he could serve us in other ways, I wished to	452.8819765780901
inform him.”	399.18685547885974
“Of what?”	309.4282902003561
“Oh, that is not my secret; I must not, therefore, tell you.”	294.2529891223175
“Besides,” said D’Artagnan, “pardon me, madame, if, guardsman as I am,	358.50331597754234
I remind you of prudence—besides, I believe we are not here in a very	354.9117914604147
proper place for imparting confidences. The men I have put to flight	450.38861075096645
will return reinforced; if they find us here, we are lost. I have sent	479.3340023508803
for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?”	483.5580366627268
“Yes, yes! You are right,” cried the affrighted Mme. Bonacieux; “let us	441.83263421421213
fly! Let us save ourselves.”	363.32361770020805
At these words she passed her arm under that of D’Artagnan, and urged	342.44460313952567
him forward eagerly.	397.8945102735697
“But whither shall we fly—whither escape?”	377.58455611363445
“Let us first withdraw from this house; afterward we shall see.”	357.2834485683153
The young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut	424.8375937627527
the door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned	428.2500337925044
into the Rue des Fossés-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they	472.23787877640245
came to the Place St. Sulpice.	308.4140008236209
“And now what are we to do, and where do you wish me to conduct you?”	490.32482825883346
asked D’Artagnan.	381.2520876222725
“I am at quite a loss how to answer you, I admit,” said Mme. Bonacieux.	452.57759781244226
“My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte, through my husband, in	337.5949014358334
order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken	333.26257190427907
place at the Louvre in the last three days, and whether there is any	369.04445936941534
danger in presenting myself there.”	431.2403666207822
“But I,” said D’Artagnan, “can go and inform Monsieur Laporte.”	318.27606389605
“No doubt you could, only there is one misfortune, and that is that	356.84537804402044
Monsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre, and would be allowed to	314.412275281621
pass; whereas you are not known there, and the gate would be closed	329.07155560862367
against you.”	447.2720151670072
“Ah, bah!” said D’Artagnan; “you have at some wicket of the Louvre a	388.76901537329326
_concierge_ who is devoted to you, and who, thanks to a password,	305.89228939694766
would—”	405.92023342783284
Mme. Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man.	463.90099656003395
“And if I give you this password,” said she, “would you forget it as	335.2722839379563
soon as you used it?”	298.79973666738226
“By my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!” said D’Artagnan, with an	378.7167388110613
accent so truthful that no one could mistake it.	440.53256848407784
“Then I believe you. You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your	426.6240091403723
fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness.”	325.70106554798986
“I will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that I can do to	379.82147158460066
serve the king and be agreeable to the queen. Dispose of me, then, as a	345.82617790961893
friend.”	369.6074444448884
“But I—where shall I go meanwhile?”	383.19074623511705
“Is there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch	377.8542599780568
you?”	308.4408642757076
“No, I can trust nobody.”	474.57817867272854
“Stop,” said D’Artagnan; “we are near Athos’s door. Yes, here it is.”	414.95910057570984
“Who is this Athos?”	379.41824782405547
“One of my friends.”	331.5132951841839
“But if he should be at home and see me?”	329.17718221762993
“He is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed	342.0451240443605
you in his apartment.”	456.64916103794445
“But if he should return?”	462.07687090887464
“Oh, he won’t return; and if he should, he will be told that I have	412.8544276486689
brought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.”	444.42820004798784
“But that will compromise me sadly, you know.”	343.5391922300317
“Of what consequence? Nobody knows you. Besides, we are in a situation	449.65281736194345
to overlook ceremony.”	351.14928781814854
“Come, then, let us go to your friend’s house. Where does he live?”	474.9569002739041
“Rue Férou, two steps from here.”	419.08815366307215
“Let us go!”	436.6321423058706
Both resumed their way. As D’Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not	312.24121685599795
within. He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the	443.47916604312684
family, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme. Bonacieux into the	334.3082821266225
little apartment of which we have given a description.	370.3871237183931
“You are at home,” said he. “Remain here, fasten the door inside, and	343.21316124714417
open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this;” and he tapped	298.07227758844573
thrice—two taps close together and pretty hard, the other after an	412.859170174125
interval, and lighter.	473.2857674408883
“That is well,” said Mme. Bonacieux. “Now, in my turn, let me give you	369.3315246588752
my instructions.”	461.8469445494208
“I am all attention.”	478.3405531358627
“Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre, on the side of the Rue	473.11486041831836
de l’Echelle, and ask for Germain.”	413.5850637532267
“Well, and then?”	313.04190048143414
“He will ask you what you want, and you will answer by these two words,	393.1461085836384
‘Tours’ and ‘Bruxelles.’ He will at once put himself at your orders.”	456.4487277230807
“And what shall I command him?”	465.98518698995576
“To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte, the queen’s _valet de chambre_.”	355.82513280267113
“And when he shall have informed him, and Monsieur Laporte is come?”	358.34698155465446
“You will send him to me.”	425.3303190618122
“That is well; but where and how shall I see you again?”	314.6450215892221
“Do you wish to see me again?”	340.38519915985523
“Certainly.”	345.53449403499815
“Well, let that care be mine, and be at ease.”	343.25851461713944
“I depend upon your word.”	411.6385921826786
“You may.”	399.9202670709278
D’Artagnan bowed to Mme. Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving	442.26828010984127
glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little	455.6875450335779
person; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and	472.4475096457163
double-locked. In two bounds he was at the Louvre; as he entered the	432.31184597546076
wicket of L’Echelle, ten o’clock struck. All the events we have	478.1477429576766
described had taken place within a half hour.	304.67591243444895
Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the	297.44212956358786
password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in	487.9293856877341
two words D’Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte	429.2173205254529
assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address,	392.39203840557286
and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he	396.0590183675123
returned.	387.17089151871073
“Young man,” said he to D’Artagnan, “a suggestion.”	402.3760619670237
“What?”	442.1037794121449
“You may get into trouble by what has taken place.”	339.8989611432708
“You believe so?”	442.05414958886956
“Yes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?”	451.5729917041864
“Well?”	443.8943930272021
“Go and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your	444.4843790837824
having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is	447.97000925043716
called an alibi.”	308.19776116119795
D’Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon	411.27210155688704
at M. de Tréville’s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest	326.88753130103527
of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Tréville’s office. As	388.6753817735534
D’Artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel, no difficulty was made	411.65097487410196
in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de	301.63904856811234
Tréville that his young compatriot, having something important to	466.10156625832053
communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de	467.98219780666875
Tréville was asking D’Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what	374.47744801577085
caused his visit at so late an hour.	459.836787954729
“Pardon me, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, who had profited by the moment	331.45943467475456
he had been left alone to put back M. de Tréville’s clock	374.09338641749616
three-quarters of an hour, “but I thought, as it was yet only	341.42241221258917
twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.”	354.62062904693965
“Twenty-five minutes past nine!” cried M. de Tréville, looking at the	445.8174471543592
clock; “why, that’s impossible!”	431.2274473824931
“Look, rather, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, “the clock shows it.”	481.17747070912435
“That’s true,” said M. de Tréville; “I believed it later. But what can	472.8319640090814
I do for you?”	473.4666477879749
Then D’Artagnan told M. de Tréville a long history about the queen. He	423.6220338630226
expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty;	369.2292776818573
he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal	311.53553664946196
with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of	477.04246912804393
which M. de Tréville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we	340.8583674556156
have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and	379.6926802296189
the queen.	440.16372990708555
As ten o’clock was striking, D’Artagnan left M. de Tréville, who	345.48798303825987
thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of	408.6344379065791
the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at	326.60115688387435
the foot of the stairs, D’Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his	434.35143154643185
cane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a	446.644626456537
turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be	480.8903104937724
perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from	483.7020359810173
that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs	385.89278267134705
and soon found himself in the street.	452.81025937393144
Chapter XI.	437.4980219842873
IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS	303.33554682355157
His visit to M. de Tréville being paid, the pensive D’Artagnan took the	314.1113935892764
longest way homeward.	415.26438778172746
On what was D’Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path,	424.4090423954069
gazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes	335.6327324682552
smiling?	458.9446883623947
He was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the	316.53089575262777
young woman was almost an ideal of love. Pretty, mysterious, initiated	425.95772744554665
in almost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming	439.7333088367604
gravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was	419.7231254630311
not wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in	395.98662668277706
love. Moreover, D’Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the	345.4644548572772
demons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important	293.8533866733024
service had established between them one of those sentiments of	418.5553174184516
gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.	394.997569081031
D’Artagnan already fancied himself, so rapid is the flight of our	342.0631618612403
dreams upon the wings of imagination, accosted by a messenger from the	363.3936428283764
young woman, who brought him some billet appointing a meeting, a gold	319.3366026144284
chain, or a diamond. We have observed that young cavaliers received	396.85988458388783
presents from their king without shame. Let us add that in these times	421.2073863264709
of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the	296.3433989480084
mistresses; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and	347.33388240931504
durable remembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of	402.45915672849105
their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts.	317.4271283373561
Without a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women	448.67081941093124
blushing. Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence,	446.9865679134215
without doubt, comes the proverb, “The most beautiful girl in the world	411.68502804641
can only give what she has.” Such as were rich gave in addition a part	380.410371563524
of their money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may	322.6829989555816
be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor	399.3807655446461
their battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished,	400.579549906156
which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow.	363.33558940068895
D’Artagnan owned nothing. Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish,	454.16056121934025
the ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the	408.8379178391813
winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers	294.1299125818476
gave their friend. D’Artagnan, following the strange custom of the	359.81174212743804
times, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor	363.05721445711515
less than if he had been in Flanders—Spain yonder, woman here. In each	427.2721325149463
there was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied.	452.8877402956447
But, we must say, at the present moment D’Artagnan was ruled by a	305.1654251535507
feeling much more noble and disinterested. The mercer had said that he	292.47672955648727
was rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as	456.3279527202857
M. Bonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of	380.12704013632765
love, which had been the consequence of it. We say _almost_, for the	451.5343427640331
idea that a young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time	463.8225603044913
rich takes nothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary	386.0222026594781
strengthens it.	411.9410937117633
There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which	433.3026365969074
are highly becoming to beauty. A fine and white stocking, a silken	392.7806462611607
robe, a lace kerchief, a pretty slipper on the foot, a tasty ribbon on	311.18289035594034
the head do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman	350.799871110342
beautiful, without reckoning the hands, which gain by all this; the	439.08664163216673
hands, among women particularly, to be beautiful must be idle.	460.22112337032036
Then D’Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the	413.4748311574664
state of his fortune, very well knows—D’Artagnan was not a millionaire;	437.09570610375033
he hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind he	330.32155660652126
fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant. In the	295.34382341524537
meanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those	403.893887244728
thousands of nothings which constitute a woman’s happiness, and be	422.7283024586822
unable to give her those thousands of nothings. At least, when the	491.1650850023584
woman is rich and the lover is not, that which he cannot offer she	303.89253866222043
offers to herself; and although it is generally with her husband’s	314.64441012085274
money that she procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it	367.3018638409844
seldom reverts to him.	324.83633601639974
Then D’Artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at	484.44273213865307
the same time a very devoted friend. In the midst of his amorous	369.1181879226714
projects for the mercer’s wife, he did not forget his friends. The	328.177737383738
pretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St.	390.6132050227213
Denis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos,	454.96811167499663
and Aramis, to whom D’Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could	317.9799720087541
enjoy charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand	307.36258622244605
of a friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on	295.35422729189344
pressing occasions, in extreme difficulties, D’Artagnan would become	310.2639723876447
the preserver of his friends.	404.74573971650506
And M. Bonacieux, whom D’Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the	316.2573234268451
officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to	376.1719417478599
save him? We are compelled to admit to our readers that D’Artagnan	347.2833342780276
thought nothing about him in any way; or that if he did think of him,	397.6969929362477
it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was,	478.5356048516859
wherever it might be. Love is the most selfish of all the passions.	404.740946063417
Let our readers reassure themselves. If D’Artagnan forgets his host, or	397.1007552625584
appears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has	342.46701973379754
been carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. But for	444.54071966258937
the moment, let us do as did the amorous Gascon; we will see after the	404.3067077637266
worthy mercer later.	349.97247106368735
D’Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the	304.9223243821471
beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue	446.5234355204357
Cherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called. As he found himself	353.12764050424346
in the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay	488.6502753404466
his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to	299.00907162109314
send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the	489.35312418321547
mousetrap. Now, if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his	345.4749564959382
abode, he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and finding	434.6275440062118
nobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be	389.41816620418706
able to conceive what all this meant. This mystery required an	402.06895283625244
explanation; at least, so D’Artagnan declared to himself.	434.469270237768
He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty	491.0523518310475
little Mme. Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already	299.1106049756102
full. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is	388.43383221897295
accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to	342.26797832081263
overflow, it will stifle you.	391.55358369978245
Paris for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven	484.33925904028206
o’clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was	421.4768557151913
delightful weather. D’Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot	436.88565549759255
where the Rue d’Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations	323.6779909423022
which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which	456.0732745913605
arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze	354.2302169011413
of night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good	435.6716555758274
shutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the	413.5275917166908
cabarets scattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane,	442.70358798767984
D’Artagnan turned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was	430.90949160596125
situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.	310.31670233851395
D’Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the	371.66833913628403
door of his friend’s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis	372.6244228764579
which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived	356.32410110184145
something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something	470.25725097154674
was enveloped in a cloak, and D’Artagnan at first believed it was a	320.93391877409005
man; but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and	339.48574890684165
the indecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman.	354.18653794324575
Further, this woman, as if not certain of the house she was seeking,	324.90510030828636
lifted up her eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then	325.37247001465494
returned again. D’Artagnan was perplexed.	431.1861007700009
“Shall I go and offer her my services?” thought he. “By her step she	420.00071429494494
must be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders	415.5078343859919
in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If I	472.57272694830976
should disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of	421.2846862020959
commencing an acquaintance.”	298.1440761432427
Meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and	327.2399282707667
windows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three	482.56957468874054
hôtels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward	318.0484717985552
the road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis	311.9881711223968
occupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.	337.56525593230623
“_Pardieu!_” said D’Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the	430.04836102636364
theologian reverted, “_pardieu_, it would be droll if this belated dove	463.09024038585693
should be in search of our friend’s house. But on my soul, it looks so.	482.4235736046155
Ah, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out.” And D’Artagnan,	472.78150963505027
making himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest	345.50582281133757
side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.	310.519016272132
The young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness	466.6840153041667
of her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which	487.3046838911496
denoted a sweet voice. D’Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.	442.8707529271311
Nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal	484.68976858051394
which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether	411.8683765436125
without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her	452.0812889401343
journey, she resolutely drew near to Aramis’s shutter, and tapped, at	393.8494240083322
three equal intervals, with her bent finger.	480.53014650234934
“This is all very fine, dear Aramis,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Ah,	310.872112811831
Monsieur Hypocrite, I understand how you study theology.”	323.33630357709853
The three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened	463.3571150162139
and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.	317.40452160857814
“Ah, ah!” said the listener, “not through doors, but through windows!	431.6071283890268
Ah, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the	477.546055196137
lady enter by escalade. Very pretty!”	482.2156954542279
But to the great astonishment of D’Artagnan, the shutter remained	314.8687393309697
closed. Still more, the light which had shone for an instant	469.01687719987086
disappeared, and all was again in obscurity.	340.3060794003107
D’Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with	488.7224685946111
all his eyes and listen with all his ears.	413.2355803759582
He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard	414.56145668835046
inside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the	367.2039385907579
shutter was opened a little way.	382.8048593654571
It may be judged whether D’Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.	331.84802877257636
Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the	325.3654287026582
eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes	295.5372419834499
of the Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty	379.2278051069287
of seeing in the dark.	460.2414140555526
D’Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white	440.8727158415402
object, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a	374.72684809665
handkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this	357.16017932455725
unfolded object.	295.3009739611853
This immediately recalled to D’Artagnan’s mind the handkerchief which	324.04251204792763
he had found at the feet of Mme. Bonacieux, which had reminded him of	467.55615773226737
that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis.	307.742685132168
“What the devil could that handkerchief signify?”	403.69658228770425
Placed where he was, D’Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis.	306.987792718931
We say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was	400.455094544975
his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of	452.22604674468334
the exterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the	344.9068863119547
preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have	446.0340576348448
plunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding	462.1531860989738
place, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran	341.2068735867555
and placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye	482.80089174640597
could pierce the interior of Aramis’s room.	355.97889199483416
Upon gaining this advantage D’Artagnan was near uttering a cry of	452.1304581942969
surprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal	429.813202476535
visitor, it was a woman! D’Artagnan, however, could only see enough to	406.44572196655
recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her	314.4611155575102
features.	338.7969678664176
At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from	402.5842061249323
her pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her.	317.62787178907695
Then some words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter	378.65536723693685
closed. The woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed	342.87032043409175
within four steps of D’Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle;	478.6731662196271
but the precaution was too late, D’Artagnan had already recognized Mme.	486.8875623256805
Bonacieux.	343.30524509854297
Mme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of	392.76415140720906
D’Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what	489.09463674753147
probability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte	422.0445452226618
in order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the	352.1847670757074
streets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being	340.7625278911102
abducted a second time?	436.22045775271454
This must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most	451.85533051408646
important affair to a woman of twenty-five! Love.	472.76489913728625
But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she	372.5375336252586
exposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man	307.67902348134726
asked himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in	448.3966715171003
heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover.	419.0546052111167
There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.	411.8591190020338
Bonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple	303.9345227824939
that D’Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively.	355.74408018771993
But at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall	305.3670990137442
like a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps	419.43216056781
which she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry	423.5966896953412
and fled.	324.6630874713234
D’Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a	460.8552407819211
woman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had	398.48878470634025
traversed a third of the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted,	392.14695870856264
not by fatigue, but by terror, and when D’Artagnan placed his hand upon	383.0548701148564
her shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, “Kill	462.0971272535665
me, if you please, you shall know nothing!”	437.04092902823913
D’Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he	452.47004096016497
felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to	381.0769555428306
reassure her by protestations of devotedness. These protestations were	466.8776190401851
nothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the	409.5085514844766
worst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux	473.4659961360594
thought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes,	391.2065368173608
cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once	456.1361232528632
perceiving it was D’Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, “Oh, it is you,	307.4221433400358
it is you! Thank God, thank God!”	366.83580545789374
“Yes, it is I,” said D’Artagnan, “it is I, whom God has sent to watch	333.7948246484133
over you.”	403.1768135190199
“Was it with that intention you followed me?” asked the young woman,	447.46272600890336
with a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its	359.43704953051173
influence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in	404.532175826236
which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy.	431.43967485924315
“No,” said D’Artagnan; “no, I confess it. It was chance that threw me	396.20553084795466
in your way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my	318.46479360528394
friends.”	360.40858721904766
“One of your friends?” interrupted Mme. Bonacieux.	323.8554204658445
“Without doubt; Aramis is one of my best friends.”	393.8740261223665
“Aramis! Who is he?”	439.8889506331259
“Come, come, you won’t tell me you don’t know Aramis?”	474.5115713827394
“This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.”	482.6412038644072
“It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?”	421.0730139439479
“Undoubtedly.”	458.4972915834133
“And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man?”	490.94302701354343
“No.”	450.55058312292306
“By a Musketeer?”	478.366334090139
“No, indeed!”	355.49415796621196
“It was not he, then, you came to seek?”	339.3263556723101
“Not the least in the world. Besides, you must have seen that the	364.24082059839543
person to whom I spoke was a woman.”	438.72552204656614
“That is true; but this woman is a friend of Aramis—”	368.33290136170694
“I know nothing of that.”	449.53051402126016
“—since she lodges with him.”	413.9633814268459
“That does not concern me.”	424.39861634573793
“But who is she?”	410.34727399486536
“Oh, that is not my secret.”	391.00992866933416
“My dear Madame Bonacieux, you are charming; but at the same time you	295.73328558693964
are one of the most mysterious women.”	368.60506207976107
“Do I lose by that?”	383.76565226251483
“No; you are, on the contrary, adorable.”	414.121148272238
“Give me your arm, then.”	450.9735252553213
“Most willingly. And now?”	458.07284195267454
“Now escort me.”	362.5377918813698
“Where?”	368.46069461298185
“Where I am going.”	413.48064019041266
“But where are you going?”	320.4659493023579
“You will see, because you will leave me at the door.”	482.9090166994397
“Shall I wait for you?”	427.5527223702792
“That will be useless.”	349.02295594432167
“You will return alone, then?”	416.1521827076947
“Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”	365.4718400530668
“But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a	404.7906640824437
woman?”	327.0292617661391
“I don’t know yet.”	402.78069261983535
“But I will know it!”	416.66852570408156
“How so?”	398.06046918597457
“I will wait until you come out.”	331.37203983360104
“In that case, adieu.”	432.79218368020395
“Why so?”	490.0775641704101
“I do not want you.”	318.7451049115964
“But you have claimed—”	309.7150083666368
“The aid of a gentleman, not the watchfulness of a spy.”	375.1790158610126
“The word is rather hard.”	481.157066813464
“How are they called who follow others in spite of them?”	384.8852704126058
“They are indiscreet.”	336.9680501125247
“The word is too mild.”	440.46147058019824
“Well, madame, I perceive I must do as you wish.”	429.01782787329773
“Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once?”	359.75463090550363
“Is there no merit in repentance?”	437.99486608434336
“And do you really repent?”	417.5055399421045
“I know nothing about it myself. But what I know is that I promise to	473.14615286290575
do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going.”	406.7759001606166
“And you will leave me then?”	419.59125481337395
“Yes.”	317.70580033584287
“Without waiting for my coming out again?”	453.79459378480226
“Yes.”	349.8993222046448
“Word of honor?”	440.149282862319
“By the faith of a gentleman. Take my arm, and let us go.”	405.07863190909103
D’Artagnan offered his arm to Mme. Bonacieux, who willingly took it,	486.7924386494109
half laughing, half trembling, and both gained the top of Rue de la	383.39415785661447
Harpe. Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had	423.2206308686832
before done in the Rue Vaugirard. She seemed, however, by certain	305.37616242449764
signs, to recognize a door, and approaching that door, “And now,	354.049691147465
monsieur,” said she, “it is here I have business; a thousand thanks for	433.33399141721753
your honorable company, which has saved me from all the dangers to	385.27941030978
which, alone, I was exposed. But the moment is come to keep your word;	372.16000705664874
I have reached my destination.”	322.8775637304368
“And you will have nothing to fear on your return?”	373.23646088627714
“I shall have nothing to fear but robbers.”	450.3247462424541
“And that is nothing?”	430.16343218815797
“What could they take from me? I have not a penny about me.”	381.4663901884166
“You forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms.”	404.71664033986156
“Which?”	305.91085172888387
“That which I found at your feet, and replaced in your pocket.”	365.31440343192907
“Hold your tongue, imprudent man! Do you wish to destroy me?”	450.273571530519
“You see very plainly that there is still danger for you, since a	357.4133579882413
single word makes you tremble; and you confess that if that word were	297.2486302278699
heard you would be ruined. Come, come, madame!” cried D’Artagnan,	388.734618329476
seizing her hands, and surveying her with an ardent glance, “come, be	370.7091656423569
more generous. Confide in me. Have you not read in my eyes that there	440.97058201961806
is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?”	334.3853240675092
“Yes,” replied Mme. Bonacieux; “therefore, ask my own secrets, and I	344.6352808816463
will reveal them to you; but those of others—that is quite another	378.46269958878145
thing.”	455.80027333774694
“Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I shall discover them; as these secrets	443.5455868655521
may have an influence over your life, these secrets must become mine.”	420.5237793567063
“Beware of what you do!” cried the young woman, in a manner so serious	436.0481150371367
as to make D’Artagnan start in spite of himself. “Oh, meddle in nothing	351.4014958125103
which concerns me. Do not seek to assist me in that which I am	427.188683102152
accomplishing. This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which	378.4109738542662
I inspire you, in the name of the service you have rendered me and	439.3372520740303
which I never shall forget while I have life. Rather, place faith in	330.66502437436543
what I tell you. Have no more concern about me; I exist no longer for	450.9273151308752
you, any more than if you had never seen me.”	474.8490347153518
“Must Aramis do as much as I, madame?” said D’Artagnan, deeply piqued.	468.4286897271379
“This is the second or third time, monsieur, that you have repeated	313.43859642928294
that name, and yet I have told you that I do not know him.”	451.52295912208444
“You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked?	424.6453857979394
Indeed, madame, you believe me too credulous!”	433.8060126522663
“Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this	420.6256214932885
story and create this personage.”	392.2755910409807
“I invent nothing, madame; I create nothing. I only speak that exact	455.380687596308
truth.”	410.4106091693582
“And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?”	297.75781704560944
“I say so, and I repeat it for the third time; that house is one	480.0362327989993
inhabited by my friend, and that friend is Aramis.”	450.57437771769094
“All this will be cleared up at a later period,” murmured the young	432.4487852789195
woman; “no, monsieur, be silent.”	465.1159236121756
“If you could see my heart,” said D’Artagnan, “you would there read so	395.75214396243405
much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would	442.234962968633
instantly satisfy my curiosity. We have nothing to fear from those who	415.8945901071201
love us.”	436.5131319885493
“You speak very suddenly of love, monsieur,” said the young woman,	312.44955972176245
shaking her head.	487.94287212816323
“That is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first	363.8252282609043
time; and because I am only twenty.”	368.8086518558275
The young woman looked at him furtively.	441.3532581813548
“Listen; I am already upon the scent,” resumed D’Artagnan. “About three	298.5982618644419
months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a	358.89536743312703
handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his	337.407292744605
house—for a handkerchief marked in the same manner, I am sure.”	361.2788685779603
“Monsieur,” said the young woman, “you weary me very much, I assure	322.82623821764906
you, with your questions.”	464.96136326147223
“But you, madame, prudent as you are, think, if you were to be arrested	423.16240934040695
with that handkerchief, and that handkerchief were to be seized, would	335.44563403561415
you not be compromised?”	395.3273713445072
“In what way? The initials are only mine—C. B., Constance Bonacieux.”	471.39628840515445
“Or Camille de Bois-Tracy.”	387.5417189923817
“Silence, monsieur! Once again, silence! Ah, since the dangers I incur	371.3872341552552
on my own account cannot stop you, think of those you may yourself	305.1333860453748
run!”	419.358194070022
“Me?”	302.9414507613478
“Yes; there is peril of imprisonment, risk of life in knowing me.”	447.24284315559305
“Then I will not leave you.”	300.4034433900624
“Monsieur!” said the young woman, supplicating him and clasping her	360.5037479267812
hands together, “monsieur, in the name of heaven, by the honor of a	387.8645277210322
soldier, by the courtesy of a gentleman, depart! There, there midnight	314.5303050879436
sounds! That is the hour when I am expected.”	310.5037860832023
“Madame,” said the young man, bowing; “I can refuse nothing asked of me	299.008247935252
thus. Be content; I will depart.”	482.68356714496144
“But you will not follow me; you will not watch me?”	482.3944305772253
“I will return home instantly.”	338.121165502903
“Ah, I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man,” said Mme.	471.12330260574726
Bonacieux, holding out her hand to him, and placing the other upon the	433.4235127850633
knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall.	436.236891906796
D’Artagnan seized the hand held out to him, and kissed it ardently.	296.5019460904203
“Ah! I wish I had never seen you!” cried D’Artagnan, with that	395.0966371965508
ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of	458.582147096594
politeness, because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves	488.30920580096404
that feeling prevails over reason.	304.6862252146426
“Well!” resumed Mme. Bonacieux, in a voice almost caressing, and	457.11781492236923
pressing the hand of D’Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, “well:	477.3212606388295
I will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be	397.05214617364004
lost forever. Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not	306.76237004291414
satisfy your curiosity?”	383.6190924133737
“And will you make the same promise to my love?” cried D’Artagnan,	395.2911643572514
beside himself with joy.	363.8155219412838
“Oh, as to that, I do not engage myself. That depends upon the	370.8539738717201
sentiments with which you may inspire me.”	379.0196669244971
“Then today, madame—”	335.5835652659384
“Oh, today, I am no further than gratitude.”	324.6406672417089
“Ah! You are too charming,” said D’Artagnan, sorrowfully; “and you	303.96437272035973
abuse my love.”	334.3282819087088
“No, I use your generosity, that’s all. But be of good cheer; with	365.5704181920225
certain people, everything comes round.”	490.1230577343808
“Oh, you render me the happiest of men! Do not forget this evening—do	443.2198245485324
not forget that promise.”	324.5399629001213
“Be satisfied. In the proper time and place I will remember everything.	388.43583283369696
Now then, go, go, in the name of heaven! I was expected at sharp	468.8241209482075
midnight, and I am late.”	330.6588098026891
“By five minutes.”	333.797575457443
“Yes; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages.”	447.0005779985943
“When one loves.”	341.3619963667991
“Well! And who told you I had no affair with a lover?”	389.43440270102656
“It is a man, then, who expects you?” cried D’Artagnan. “A man!”	342.63495615603756
“The discussion is going to begin again!” said Mme. Bonacieux, with a	395.79580104804654
half-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience.	465.4123365620621
“No, no; I go, I depart! I believe in you, and I would have all the	305.49530637572883
merit of my devotion, even if that devotion were stupidity. Adieu,	312.3333947895135
madame, adieu!”	368.2112089775858
And as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort	491.7832498641402
from the hand he held, he sprang away, running, while Mme. Bonacieux	388.6137955301197
knocked, as at the shutter, three light and regular taps. When he had	400.86348208640936
gained the angle of the street, he turned. The door had been opened,	487.2395211556735
and shut again; the mercer’s pretty wife had disappeared.	368.2586621268664
D’Artagnan pursued his way. He had given his word not to watch Mme.	324.58979401493514
Bonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was	391.2800620541293
going or upon the person who should accompany her, D’Artagnan would	366.87874126450646
have returned home, since he had so promised. Five minutes later he was	458.0616934153918
in the Rue des Fossoyeurs.	411.375470391147
“Poor Athos!” said he; “he will never guess what all this means. He	346.403296058415
will have fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned	445.7058586218342
home, where he will have learned that a woman had been there. A woman	434.1946290347602
with Athos! After all,” continued D’Artagnan, “there was certainly one	488.71726404011974
with Aramis. All this is very strange; and I am curious to know how it	336.7466136408272
will end.”	401.56164429773753
“Badly, monsieur, badly!” replied a voice which the young man	344.286762179383
recognized as that of Planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very	293.83237827847364
preoccupied people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which	448.7842173146203
were the stairs which led to his chamber.	295.4382069606845
“How, badly? What do you mean by that, you idiot?” asked D’Artagnan.	491.54096176845735
“What has happened?”	352.556138966714
“All sorts of misfortunes.”	313.47833245158455
“What?”	366.9946164611611
“In the first place, Monsieur Athos is arrested.”	475.4098041097013
“Arrested! Athos arrested! What for?”	456.5053703603252
“He was found in your lodging; they took him for you.”	345.28834315057486
“And by whom was he arrested?”	347.39716139255506
“By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight.”	478.2829910684321
“Why did he not tell them his name? Why did he not tell them he knew	396.8710633091117
nothing about this affair?”	440.49835002997463
“He took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me	404.16979851090395
and said, ‘It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and	411.0799707453539
not I, since he knows everything and I know nothing. They will believe	430.1202890155364
he is arrested, and that will give him time; in three days I will tell	358.8679641391384
them who I am, and they cannot fail to let me go.’”	480.08692758704393
“Bravo, Athos! Noble heart!” murmured D’Artagnan. “I know him well	416.66314775349616
there! And what did the officers do?”	307.62511416174254
“Four conveyed him away, I don’t know where—to the Bastille or Fort	482.79339961866447
l’Evêque. Two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place	336.39067431718536
and took all the papers. The last two mounted guard at the door during	424.4653979878044
this examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the	410.2728056163355
house empty and exposed.”	415.6391017443417
“And Porthos and Aramis?”	299.52766793127813
“I could not find them; they did not come.”	390.61457354771915
“But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?”	305.9904692187172
“Yes, monsieur.”	454.52277823698654
“Well, don’t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened.	387.87681447865987
Let them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin. Here it would be dangerous;	442.43422781255794
the house may be watched. I will run to Monsieur de Tréville to tell	339.6657710105348
them all this, and will meet them there.”	448.7924664046929
“Very well, monsieur,” said Planchet.	339.65783849353477
“But you will remain; you are not afraid?” said D’Artagnan, coming back	412.04280827717747
to recommend courage to his lackey.	443.0320467396541
“Be easy, monsieur,” said Planchet; “you do not know me yet. I am brave	449.3851154536259
when I set about it. It is all in beginning. Besides, I am a Picard.”	300.746944833893
“Then it is understood,” said D’Artagnan; “you would rather be killed	428.7582335155123
than desert your post?”	317.5722013985997
“Yes, monsieur; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to	366.9261227627504
Monsieur that I am attached to him.”	359.4182331244843
“Good!” said D’Artagnan to himself. “It appears that the method I have	421.40600468840495
adopted with this boy is decidedly the best. I shall use it again upon	292.9583457717164
occasion.”	391.21701587558334
And with all the swiftness of his legs, already a little fatigued,	313.6015519193055
however, with the perambulations of the day, D’Artagnan directed his	425.89642041338266
course toward M. de Tréville’s.	491.1988900481184
M. de Tréville was not at his hôtel. His company was on guard at the	423.1842641143652
Louvre; he was at the Louvre with his company.	397.86326698395305
It was necessary to reach M. de Tréville; it was important that he	394.92222994034285
should be informed of what was passing. D’Artagnan resolved to try and	381.5600157701307
enter the Louvre. His costume of Guardsman in the company of M.	311.2792291353543
Dessessart ought to be his passport.	381.13478151616386
He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins, and came up to the	354.760112610802
quay, in order to take the New Bridge. He had at first an idea of	398.4300692403481
crossing by the ferry; but on gaining the riverside, he had	377.39318570278357
mechanically put his hand into his pocket, and perceived that he had	319.31428106089135
not wherewithal to pay his passage.	400.1898644397081
As he gained the top of the Rue Guénegaud, he saw two persons coming	346.76381346744347
out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him. Of the	303.96887526140296
two persons who composed this group, one was a man and the other a	328.9362227572813
woman. The woman had the outline of Mme. Bonacieux; the man resembled	389.2443752779394
Aramis so much as to be mistaken for him.	353.92351072585654
Besides, the woman wore that black mantle which D’Artagnan could still	321.9408504670514
see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of	307.1779464666677
the Rue de la Harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a	376.4784627094145
Musketeer.	438.050819894066
The woman’s hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to	413.40076992550865
his face. Both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in	325.92516362678793
not being recognized.	357.9639003572006
They took the bridge. That was D’Artagnan’s road, as he was going to	332.71051939985296
the Louvre. D’Artagnan followed them.	374.50139034326673
He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman	413.7697201194993
was really Mme. Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis.	317.54771523229726
He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his	339.9239638402612
heart. He felt himself doubly betrayed, by his friend and by her whom	380.3035710996839
he already loved like a mistress. Mme. Bonacieux had declared to him,	316.0527986690858
by all the gods, that she did not know Aramis; and a quarter of an hour	394.4151465764018
after having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of	491.78080006651703
Aramis.	459.0117933810434
D’Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer’s pretty	297.5106433967697
wife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude	320.22055010548684
for having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her	297.0455638997776
off, and that she had promised him nothing. He considered himself an	487.1083906798615
outraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover. Blood and anger mounted to his	349.29276844691003
face; he was resolved to unravel the mystery.	345.0172459557505
The young man and young woman perceived they were watched, and	311.6539163727647
redoubled their speed. D’Artagnan determined upon his course. He passed	447.7046144707845
them, then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine,	336.21624941608366
which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that	466.345498498535
part of the bridge.	345.10413530858574
D’Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.	319.1637616251317
“What do you want, monsieur?” demanded the Musketeer, recoiling a step,	320.133330917872
and with a foreign accent, which proved to D’Artagnan that he was	476.61161300762467
deceived in one of his conjectures.	421.22906227426745
“It is not Aramis!” cried he.	430.7225581906131
“No, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you	415.63758531605265
have mistaken me for another, and pardon you.”	356.2975677457495
“You pardon me?” cried D’Artagnan.	482.32056726740007
“Yes,” replied the stranger. “Allow me, then, to pass on, since it is	401.13059025254165
not with me you have anything to do.”	445.91120751037465
“You are right, monsieur, it is not with you that I have anything to	404.4662470215096
do; it is with Madame.”	459.37508773546386
“With Madame! You do not know her,” replied the stranger.	376.4651978418322
“You are deceived, monsieur; I know her very well.”	439.2025977458848
“Ah,” said Mme. Bonacieux; in a tone of reproach, “ah, monsieur, I had	377.11207118616176
your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman. I hoped to be	486.6512120058079
able to rely upon that.”	430.96587661659294
“And I, madame!” said D’Artagnan, embarrassed; “you promised me—”	360.24765229236505
“Take my arm, madame,” said the stranger, “and let us continue our	386.0745660387418
way.”	403.0310212642338
D’Artagnan, however, stupefied, cast down, annihilated by all that	336.65137920995085
happened, stood, with crossed arms, before the Musketeer and Mme.	378.7352562066258
Bonacieux.	466.67251996429064
The Musketeer advanced two steps, and pushed D’Artagnan aside with his	479.44596316438765
hand. D’Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword. At the same	345.69975702727714
time, and with the rapidity of lightning, the stranger drew his.	317.93929063266415
“In the name of heaven, my Lord!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, throwing	476.72689806470896
herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands.	326.05353419692744
“My Lord!” cried D’Artagnan, enlightened by a sudden idea, “my Lord!	433.4270967343411
Pardon me, monsieur, but you are not—”	473.2051797459456
“My Lord the Duke of Buckingham,” said Mme. Bonacieux, in an undertone;	331.0003450113885
“and now you may ruin us all.”	319.5934126587297
“My Lord, Madame, I ask a hundred pardons! But I love her, my Lord, and	463.63169839376997
was jealous. You know what it is to love, my Lord. Pardon me, and then	311.3061903381557
tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace?”	488.90317034314734
“You are a brave young man,” said Buckingham, holding out his hand to	424.378708670847
D’Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully. “You offer me your services;	417.7051428774094
with the same frankness I accept them. Follow us at a distance of	363.77178397152335
twenty paces, as far as the Louvre, and if anyone watches us, slay	353.5416873581295
him!”	324.71192745887345
D’Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and	472.55006433000653
Mme. Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them,	417.3379371791784
ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of	318.0272096580673
Charles I.	388.5262689601013
Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his	442.62381209446335
devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the	340.0038878744681
Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference.	366.32306261932786
As for D’Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the	453.9813849981168
Pomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without	350.07406330997856
giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had	440.0335391427377
caused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in	418.7171819783698
which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.	376.4797258869114
Meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our	335.5463397853408
three friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his	300.1068529035092
guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre.	415.23350303500445
Chapter XII.	405.3263912020534
GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM	464.7390421638131
Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme.	347.488446288896
Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform	321.145285256319
of the Musketeers of M. de Tréville, who, as we have said, were that	329.20932153539115
evening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen;	352.7185506139653
and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of	455.86374740904506
having introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the	481.7444861702767
risk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of	303.6316325664105
what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a	343.8118969238293
mercer?	393.49380408914317
Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman	449.359139918589
followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space	327.6886736043564
passed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants’ door, open by day but	391.2193453259947
generally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found	472.2544413982589
themselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the	316.78523539323055
turnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the	302.6618987844235
people of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke	444.5294079027827
by the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade,	444.71835186560554
put her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase.	339.31366821408585
The duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed	385.1608545380382
the course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps	326.20520166412854
farther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the	362.09797651596546
duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, “Remain here, my	318.21039638515737
Lord Duke; someone will come.” She then went out by the same door,	328.37277761712335
which she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner.	327.45638138061787
Nevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of	385.66561609835236
Buckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient	378.6188545738332
points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of	420.63837708671633
romance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he	407.6257735088396
had risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended	451.5715137584333
message from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to	414.8266587905967
Paris, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing	319.8710061278383
the position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he	356.53260378943156
would not depart without seeing her. The queen had at first positively	412.32927502431556
refused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated,	383.39290578154805
would commit some folly. She had already decided upon seeing him and	399.22527982555187
urging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to	463.61932493054815
this decision, Mme. Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the	429.1565070775881
duke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted. For two days no	356.9334647063978
one knew what had become of her, and everything remained in suspense;	394.97718165571587
but once free, and placed in communication with Laporte, matters	433.74122101267136
resumed their course, and she accomplished the perilous enterprise	457.0134910673256
which, but for her arrest, would have been executed three days earlier.	480.63846207704603
Buckingham, left alone, walked toward a mirror. His Musketeer’s uniform	309.0554896663368
became him marvelously.	324.90026756683665
At thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title, for	405.6924741039985
the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or	404.63706277966435
England.	296.54371085073086
The favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom	481.6235500041862
which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice,	480.436056353719
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous	459.7586838965535
existences which survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish	405.5880805694766
posterity.	377.2602854122047
Sure of himself, convinced of his own power, certain that the laws	484.5616486658209
which rule other men could not reach him, he went straight to the	410.1213439283607
object he aimed at, even were this object so elevated and so dazzling	309.9573515871753
that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated	464.6650588488907
it. It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the	295.9321060760093
beautiful and proud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by	422.85932610687746
dazzling her.	292.9298363535491
George Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said,	351.750692590838
restored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his	490.10404938143006
hat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with	343.1853054033145
joy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed	420.1789155989183
for, he smiled upon himself with pride and hope.	433.66161245086244
At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman	315.36017371624314
appeared. Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a	302.5958976255713
cry. It was the queen!	299.9764237341716
Anne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that	385.6755401882356
is to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty.	346.5015430222415
Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess; her eyes, which cast the	476.5033347599673
brilliancy of emeralds, were perfectly beautiful, and yet were at the	349.9744218130268
same time full of sweetness and majesty.	468.99569988487224
Her mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that of	390.9815952625852
all princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond the	386.94537629220895
other, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly	369.3339559090182
disdainful in its contempt.	331.5917593933366
Her skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms were	470.99923277283295
of surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as	359.15296441383396
incomparable.	476.1961682795397
Lastly, her hair, which, from being light in her youth, had become	325.9873079311037
chestnut, and which she wore curled very plainly, and with much powder,	351.5213975996854
admirably set off her face, in which the most rigid critic could only	358.1523182063831
have desired a little less rouge, and the most fastidious sculptor a	317.5299854831268
little more fineness in the nose.	335.29105855486733
Buckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria	370.80598134621005
appeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fêtes, or carousals, as she	340.23676072806535
appeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white	362.52806978336037
satin, and accompanied by Donna Estafania—the only one of her Spanish	447.876441730676
women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or	389.0953353939044
by the persecutions of Richelieu.	438.25441141435834
Anne of Austria took two steps forward. Buckingham threw himself at her	323.83429538279927
feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her	450.1712463864369
robe.	430.1136316829944
“Duke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written	475.54292804618046
to.”	437.0517553279259
“Yes, yes, madame! Yes, your Majesty!” cried the duke. “I know that I	330.08716925121394
must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become	317.04991093695844
animated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in	338.3224421080197
love. Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you.”	400.84950908111205
“Yes,” replied Anne, “but you know why and how I see you; because,	388.51610871409616
insensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city	432.64298731333645
where, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run the	302.58027467565637
risk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates	420.0075514594064
us—the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows.	424.7663297772939
It is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short,	409.8112528571029
I see you to tell you that we must never see each other again.”	391.90223481448743
“Speak on, madame, speak on, Queen,” said Buckingham; “the sweetness of	337.46257080594637
your voice covers the harshness of your words. You talk of sacrilege!	342.1451154751929
Why, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for	299.1022809081752
each other.”	294.15335052194865
“My Lord,” cried the queen, “you forget that I have never said that I	461.419260746291
love you.”	394.231191802781
“But you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to	370.9160734553394
speak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great	411.4582797863285
an ingratitude. For tell me, where can you find a love like mine—a love	488.4603973973331
which neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a love	406.5951028733521
which contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance	488.1244949349606
word? It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first	319.2250967195805
time, and during those three years I have loved you thus. Shall I tell	449.6359273277845
you each ornament of your toilet? Mark! I see you now. You were seated	426.545726110989
upon cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin	410.21091778886426
embroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your	381.3412727270002
beautiful arms—those lovely arms—with large diamonds. You wore a close	409.4516227164143
ruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in	408.8575972812852
that cap a heron’s feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see	318.18175975616276
you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now—a	488.4709834845628
hundred times more beautiful!”	437.2520351142597
“What folly,” murmured Anne of Austria, who had not the courage to find	431.04844980872235
fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his	316.91978543367213
heart, “what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances!”	342.1504840074336
“And upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my	293.4105035705203
happiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh	462.524667240064
diamond which I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth	303.097607505228
which you have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years,	418.2776820641086
madame, I have only seen you four times—the first, which I have	405.39151596719705
described to you; the second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse;	383.53027347669376
the third, in the gardens of Amiens.”	410.7029888588391
“Duke,” said the queen, blushing, “never speak of that evening.”	390.63143558849526
“Oh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is	474.8386051528415
the most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a	367.2469376739724
beautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely	292.50653476554356
the blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able	488.7519996975326
for one instant to be alone with you. Then you were about to tell me	302.39064779391657
all—the isolation of your life, the griefs of your heart. You leaned	418.1857633416681
upon my arm—upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you,	388.5509449116453
your beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me I	359.4861197158543
trembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen! Queen! You do not know what	351.1652917738134
felicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a	366.77747775291135
moment like that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I	316.7922803940156
have to live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that	296.90499557363677
night, madame, that night you loved me, I will swear it.”	345.27914352486545
“My Lord, yes; it is possible that the influence of the place, the	377.0615282779458
charm of the beautiful evening, the fascination of your look—the	407.8107012218397
thousand circumstances, in short, which sometimes unite to destroy a	471.053033397921
woman—were grouped around me on that fatal evening; but, my Lord, you	435.76036107163617
saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered. At the first	478.38087356936535
word you dared to utter, at the first freedom to which I had to reply,	464.02362586088867
I called for help.”	312.0128771746774
“Yes, yes, that is true. And any other love but mine would have sunk	483.7714646707843
beneath this ordeal; but my love came out from it more ardent and more	423.4563218211358
eternal. You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris;	440.363300494634
you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my	376.2425226272604
master had charged me to watch. What to me were all the treasures in	427.1019247069472
the world, or all the kings of the earth! Eight days after, I was back	417.37150180014675
again, madame. That time you had nothing to say to me; I had risked my	476.98834793474515
life and favor to see you but for a second. I did not even touch your	477.4274845210963
hand, and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant.”	433.2855070956442
“Yes, but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no	308.2390478998576
part, as you well know, my Lord. The king, excited by the cardinal,	398.06835797585734
made a terrible clamor. Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange	474.97743110515125
was exiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished	395.6178724480045
to come back as ambassador to France, the king himself—remember, my	309.688451436028
lord—the king himself opposed it.”	446.1512792626113
“Yes, and France is about to pay for her king’s refusal with a war. I	367.3514252203604
am not allowed to see you, madame, but you shall every day hear of me.	422.32718307085975
What object, think you, have this expedition to Ré and this league with	453.12190993000956
the Protestants of La Rochelle which I am projecting? The pleasure of	398.1963385364873
seeing you. I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I	353.1544061493007
know that well. But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will	342.83860316716294
require a negotiator; that negotiator will be me. They will not dare to	455.35444428996135
refuse me then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and	400.07847951121
will be happy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have	297.80991602910166
to pay for my happiness with their lives; but what is that to me,	403.38835214062027
provided I see you again! All this is perhaps folly—perhaps insanity;	481.6786515766372
but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love; what queen a	426.7051273736259
servant more ardent?”	422.7951809829067
“My Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you	405.6573502033439
more strongly. All these proofs of love which you would give me are	433.68309525556595
almost crimes.”	302.829908416914
“Because you do not love me, madame! If you loved me, you would view	464.66164142381547
all this otherwise. If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be	418.4087886522472
too great happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was	447.954276913258
less cruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.”	371.21582962695254
“Madame de Chevreuse was not queen,” murmured Anne of Austria,	299.4121103770678
overcome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a	339.54098726577047
passion.	474.4833150549903
“You would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you	435.7396937964331
would love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank	346.30719492690224
alone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been	346.35042285789484
Madame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped. Thanks for those	377.17592038894014
sweet words! Oh, my beautiful sovereign, a hundred times, thanks!”	305.1562483003676
“Oh, my Lord! You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not	411.88302915929387
mean to say—”	338.17184848584105
“Silence, silence!” cried the duke. “If I am happy in an error, do not	368.9629242878031
have the cruelty to lift me from it. You have told me yourself, madame,	383.1480287267074
that I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in	390.75083524081333
it—for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a	387.7025862829519
presentiment that I should shortly die.” And the duke smiled, with a	454.7372372859602
smile at once sad and charming.	334.4634101591993
“Oh, my God!” cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which	368.3806956546789
proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she	295.4131416623288
ventured to tell.	325.2538915895192
“I do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even	440.66493693853977
ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of	336.5649788398306
such dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have	359.0412245860813
almost given me, will have richly paid all—were it my life.”	330.1447064229893
“Oh, but I,” said Anne, “I also, duke, have had presentiments; I also	312.0349902630208
have had dreams. I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded.”	394.7829322459533
“In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?” interrupted	404.7912261361878
Buckingham.	293.7066236909255
“Yes, it was so, my Lord, it was so—in the left side, and with a knife.	396.3670278704892
Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream? I have imparted it	456.4650286782705
to no one but my God, and that in my prayers.”	398.7625463862872
“I ask for no more. You love me, madame; it is enough.”	351.8575304081063
“I love you, I?”	407.38753338528034
“Yes, yes. Would God send the same dreams to you as to me if you did	391.3110511067469
not love me? Should we have the same presentiments if our existences	370.79214812856276
did not touch at the heart? You love me, my beautiful queen, and you	437.6183276304711
will weep for me?”	302.05758942971084
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Anne of Austria, “this is more than I can	452.7732792595035
bear. In the name of heaven, Duke, leave me, go! I do not know whether	462.84680835131826
I love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be	454.4952114580675
perjured. Take pity on me, then, and go! Oh, if you are struck in	354.3300642811577
France, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me	303.0232374510965
was the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run	310.0768754922479
mad. Depart then, depart, I implore you!”	318.49005404630975
“Oh, how beautiful you are thus! Oh, how I love you!” said Buckingham.	459.62685675459716
“Go, go, I implore you, and return hereafter! Come back as ambassador,	436.22754293523064
come back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend	292.9643786730078
you, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer	357.9901756045743
fear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you.”	471.86076418909374
“Oh, is this true what you say?”	346.6825991556246
“Yes.”	416.324445670478
“Oh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from	316.2567512912393
you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you	336.17414638369763
have worn, and that I may wear in my turn—a ring, a necklace, a chain.”	392.2033465818712
“Will you depart—will you depart, if I give you that you demand?”	362.9914201546817
“Yes.”	454.1216776161714
“This very instant?”	449.48714851069644
“Yes.”	401.5141263511483
“You will leave France, you will return to England?”	485.44461800535737
“I will, I swear to you.”	312.8181654979794
“Wait, then, wait.”	371.49866720351446
Anne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost	482.12295183239985
immediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher	412.18040936883864
encrusted with gold.	370.81239937155425
“Here, my Lord, here,” said she, “keep this in memory of me.”	313.76528534469566
Buckingham took the casket, and fell a second time on his knees.	450.78488070509536
“You have promised me to go,” said the queen.	316.9647304614482
“And I keep my word. Your hand, madame, your hand, and I depart!”	472.1910864032154
Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning	456.6220589669068
with the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about	435.55691750886797
to fail her.	406.622379638991
Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and	448.17659612283876
then rising, said, “Within six months, if I am not dead, I shall have	451.00811703877457
seen you again, madame—even if I have to overturn the world.” And	336.999509448771
faithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment.	315.88112100207513
In the corridor he met Mme. Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who,	332.10101619245245
with the same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of	351.9559174327855
the Louvre.	339.8736301022636
Chapter XIII.	405.733037059706
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX	480.3201216681692
There was in all this, as may have been observed, one personage	414.6635776509873
concerned, of whom, notwithstanding his precarious position, we have	360.6353550635938
appeared to take but very little notice. This personage was M.	446.0407973537299
Bonacieux, the respectable martyr of the political and amorous	464.7424556985585
intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant	355.8977467014154
and chivalric period.	483.98960668642894
Fortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember—fortunately	432.8053014534819
we have promised not to lose sight of him.	387.2774708565357
The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille,	480.14445637222826
where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading	441.0029440669956
their muskets. Thence, introduced into a half-subterranean gallery, he	475.03552292040456
became, on the part of those who had brought him, the object of the	389.48768959187305
grossest insults and the harshest treatment. The officers perceived	379.97885537189865
that they had not to deal with a gentleman, and they treated him like a	401.43478471295174
very peasant.	404.5666506812912
At the end of half an hour or thereabouts, a clerk came to put an end	317.50649466985163
to his tortures, but not to his anxiety, by giving the order to conduct	369.6560329581812
M. Bonacieux to the Chamber of Examination. Ordinarily, prisoners were	310.5699929256669
interrogated in their cells; but they did not do so with M. Bonacieux.	328.75797328037515
Two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter	303.50133922464215
a corridor in which were three sentinels, opened a door and pushed him	459.91198430450015
unceremoniously into a low room, where the only furniture was a table,	376.0258381105047
a chair, and a commissary. The commissary was seated in the chair, and	449.45730126768
was writing at the table.	385.3599486167215
The two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from	316.34138965177965
the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.	381.0067384558246
The commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his	476.9563693603461
papers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with. This	426.0152515871531
commissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose, with	445.17428313260393
yellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and	400.4885580908479
penetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the	342.28373936125564
polecat and the fox. His head, supported by a long and flexible neck,	385.68629592278097
issued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very	469.9251300419209
much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell. He	351.01873258664295
began by asking M. Bonacieux his name, age, condition, and abode.	399.6577219436022
The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux, that he	353.9369143504167
was fifty-one years old, a retired mercer, and lived Rue des	321.4581079783775
Fossoyeurs, No. 14.	368.01349164583155
The commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him	418.9826891353406
a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle	371.08034734961694
with public matters. He complicated this exordium by an exposition in	483.75886644723954
which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal, that	355.1180102487002
incomparable minister, that conqueror of past ministers, that example	410.98437756728237
for ministers to come—deeds and power which none could thwart with	479.5066178626531
impunity.	433.5131379895464
After this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawk’s eye upon	302.884539085931
poor Bonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation.	392.66746130420717
The reflections of the mercer were already made; he cursed the instant	427.6902526683407
when M. Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter, and	320.2240883808356
particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady	306.18944046124943
of the Linen to her Majesty.	303.7530311319016
At bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness	482.8907117892819
mixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice.	436.00696371328127
The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary	488.2316673035939
sentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive	386.4223211992131
feelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what	333.43905150862867
had just been said to him.	385.90552486861736
“But, Monsieur Commissary,” said he, calmly, “believe that I know and	321.006159821372
appreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence	354.08976132784625
by whom we have the honor to be governed.”	390.79539390925186
“Indeed?” asked the commissary, with an air of doubt. “If that is	327.7637624418457
really so, how came you in the Bastille?”	481.27962165692804
“How I came there, or rather why I am there,” replied Bonacieux, “that	421.25269273885897
is entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don’t know myself;	344.39270792194833
but to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged	331.5083087759326
Monsieur the Cardinal.”	469.5406736714556
“You must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and	408.0744172836184
are accused of high treason.”	348.5458934992448
“Of high treason!” cried Bonacieux, terrified; “of high treason! How is	466.9890116926191
it possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors	304.33488692122836
Spaniards, to be accused of high treason? Consider, monsieur, the thing	470.1941526987861
is absolutely impossible.”	432.8522886183197
“Monsieur Bonacieux,” said the commissary, looking at the accused as if	394.8999605814971
his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of	456.9807981695061
hearts, “you have a wife?”	445.60406221553137
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was	366.1885865219316
at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; “that is to	439.08621124417886
say, I _had_ one.”	364.2064821660507
“What, you ‘_had_ one’? What have you done with her, then, if you have	435.62154070596966
her no longer?”	316.2905588404723
“They have abducted her, monsieur.”	480.8845732571948
“They have abducted her? Ah!”	472.5993737521462
Bonacieux inferred from this “Ah” that the affair grew more and more	338.5652553551285
intricate.	382.34379847545176
“They have abducted her,” added the commissary; “and do you know the	413.65073410333946
man who has committed this deed?”	351.46523339389097
“I think I know him.”	368.400516522887
“Who is he?”	447.99317488451754
“Remember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I	440.49672227067407
only suspect.”	427.3907142599629
“Whom do you suspect? Come, answer freely.”	292.68226241811124
M. Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better	477.8824057116069
deny everything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be	336.3534389921983
suspected that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he	465.11129291174586
might prove his good will. He decided, then, to tell all.	362.47624210998686
“I suspect,” said he, “a tall, dark man, of lofty carriage, who has the	460.9825394173584
air of a great lord. He has followed us several times, as I think, when	340.3287654117475
I have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her	310.8475358060412
home.”	409.76233718574395
The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness.	349.7795953406253
“And his name?” said he.	475.35309101880614
“Oh, as to his name, I know nothing about it; but if I were ever to	359.6616263064996
meet him, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it,	408.37505588488017
were he among a thousand persons.”	464.76336665923293
The face of the commissary grew still darker.	384.882728017169
“You should recognize him among a thousand, say you?” continued he.	400.03925873012327
“That is to say,” cried Bonacieux, who saw he had taken a false step,	328.9357814539289
“that is to say—”	462.4383695906113
“You have answered that you should recognize him,” said the commissary.	340.1051128128137
“That is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed	292.96574557819076
further, someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your	456.24441802538104
wife.”	472.87410970177575
“But I have not told you that I know him!” cried Bonacieux, in despair.	377.428599452914
“I told you, on the contrary—”	438.9819978793324
“Take away the prisoner,” said the commissary to the two guards.	341.33331957134857
“Where must we place him?” demanded the chief.	407.3591889087726
“In a dungeon.”	465.5124574795253
“Which?”	422.3040138125367
“Good Lord! In the first one handy, provided it is safe,” said the	396.16743399081395
commissary, with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with	455.47673239152596
horror.	434.0804926158389
“Alas, alas!” said he to himself, “misfortune is over my head; my wife	463.9930017478416
must have committed some frightful crime. They believe me her	463.3753269087511
accomplice, and will punish me with her. She must have spoken; she must	446.1679196062031
have confessed everything—a woman is so weak! A dungeon! The first he	417.50981621595224
comes to! That’s it! A night is soon passed; and tomorrow to the wheel,	367.44171807494155
to the gallows! Oh, my God, my God, have pity on me!”	316.3957835117834
Without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M.	381.16525141069144
Bonacieux—lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty	292.0144406261617
well accustomed—the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and	370.76434227348943
led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and	382.2021564927208
dispatched it by an officer in waiting.	486.9644650500164
Bonacieux could not close his eyes; not because his dungeon was so very	340.2969057500802
disagreeable, but because his uneasiness was so great. He sat all night	449.3557251314812
on his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of	447.5711743769014
the sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to	491.8745580360837
have taken funereal tints.	458.80629660257694
All at once he heard his bolts drawn, and made a terrified bound. He	432.85468298838174
believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he	444.57918580615956
saw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his	449.78819418767387
commissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was	301.6259964360003
ready to embrace them both.	468.721096979503
“Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening, my	352.88740226073674
good man, and I advise you to tell the whole truth; for your repentance	428.81659102770357
alone can remove the anger of the cardinal.”	487.68668842824354
“Why, I am ready to tell everything,” cried Bonacieux, “at least, all	453.72445904314486
that I know. Interrogate me, I entreat you!”	318.28324671174767
“Where is your wife, in the first place?”	452.87638218129973
“Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?”	375.5995846218001
“Yes, but yesterday at five o’clock in the afternoon, thanks to you,	393.9740103824714
she escaped.”	447.9709341479631
“My wife escaped!” cried Bonacieux. “Oh, unfortunate creature!	430.3414312309786
Monsieur, if she has escaped, it is not my fault, I swear.”	334.24490435720253
“What business had you, then, to go into the chamber of Monsieur	417.74688731548446
d’Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during	378.9143106506789
the day?”	465.0306877752873
“Ah, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I	469.00144284736825
was in the wrong. I did go to Monsieur d’Artagnan’s.”	321.0498952414684
“What was the aim of that visit?”	466.3642015045077
“To beg him to assist me in finding my wife. I believed I had a right	429.60921593886167
to endeavor to find her. I was deceived, as it appears, and I ask your	440.5785221602322
pardon.”	448.87028281682524
“And what did Monsieur d’Artagnan reply?”	437.25702833480716
“Monsieur d’Artagnan promised me his assistance; but I soon found out	445.83106766539186
that he was betraying me.”	442.73315966346354
“You impose upon justice. Monsieur d’Artagnan made a compact with you;	480.66205888094373
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested	322.0489578367902
your wife, and has placed her beyond reach.”	469.0316213949918
“M. d’Artagnan has abducted my wife! Come now, what are you telling	343.8880411411431
me?”	313.20036164655477
“Fortunately, Monsieur d’Artagnan is in our hands, and you shall be	419.65752301185717
confronted with him.”	410.89850092104643
“By my faith, I ask no better,” cried Bonacieux; “I shall not be sorry	327.45573158004515
to see the face of an acquaintance.”	372.88426319142513
“Bring in the Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary to the guards.	339.3089827690882
The two guards led in Athos.	486.45814448412017
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary, addressing Athos, “declare	303.2586032876321
all that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur.”	378.9805744148389
“But,” cried Bonacieux, “this is not Monsieur d’Artagnan whom you show	338.25889554968063
me.”	441.25089356072385
“What! Not Monsieur d’Artagnan?” exclaimed the commissary.	439.73375651356554
“Not the least in the world,” replied Bonacieux.	384.34729394696217
“What is this gentleman’s name?” asked the commissary.	456.7112685978501
“I cannot tell you; I don’t know him.”	485.15306304528565
“How! You don’t know him?”	403.00727031405324
“No.”	478.48158365408676
“Did you never see him?”	486.5232977251344
“Yes, I have seen him, but I don’t know what he calls himself.”	377.6110994632695
“Your name?” replied the commissary.	466.9385975859477
“Athos,” replied the Musketeer.	425.2240183500951
“But that is not a man’s name; that is the name of a mountain,” cried	380.0594924290504
the poor questioner, who began to lose his head.	396.8941276139327
“That is my name,” said Athos, quietly.	381.75320508064664
“But you said that your name was D’Artagnan.”	433.17077268464163
“Who, I?”	318.3301758165465
“Yes, you.”	356.15829848155715
“Somebody said to me, ‘You are Monsieur d’Artagnan?’ I answered, ‘You	480.79029510395725
think so?’ My guards exclaimed that they were sure of it. I did not	404.49523522701384
wish to contradict them; besides, I might be deceived.”	452.91147243799276
“Monsieur, you insult the majesty of justice.”	490.8284916581266
“Not at all,” said Athos, calmly.	343.9708180997335
“You are Monsieur d’Artagnan.”	424.28544029991326
“You see, monsieur, that you say it again.”	393.81000281812254
“But I tell you, Monsieur Commissary,” cried Bonacieux, in his turn,	390.23147617471597
“there is not the least doubt about the matter. Monsieur d’Artagnan is	462.16751119571813
my tenant, although he does not pay me my rent—and even better on that	329.22783972278404
account ought I to know him. Monsieur d’Artagnan is a young man,	430.86669847650217
scarcely nineteen or twenty, and this gentleman must be thirty at	301.07546915273565
least. Monsieur d’Artagnan is in Monsieur Dessessart’s Guards, and this	375.5630176181313
gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Tréville’s Musketeers. Look	341.6958418787863
at his uniform, Monsieur Commissary, look at his uniform!”	360.5922610995635
“That’s true,” murmured the commissary; “_pardieu_, that’s true.”	324.6925449052846
At this moment the door was opened quickly, and a messenger, introduced	341.3614846165618
by one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille, gave a letter to the	338.2813139014697
commissary.	440.07107819731914
“Oh, unhappy woman!” cried the commissary.	397.22974806568277
“How? What do you say? Of whom do you speak? It is not of my wife, I	418.19067549517996
hope!”	387.6659286195869
“On the contrary, it is of her. Yours is a pretty business.”	471.1449512850077
“But,” said the agitated mercer, “do me the pleasure, monsieur, to tell	467.0404572782602
me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does	377.1228028901002
while I am in prison?”	298.42649685200274
“Because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you—of	314.1466306709193
an infernal plan.”	325.32737149238244
“I swear to you, Monsieur Commissary, that you are in the profoundest	405.01456941088725
error, that I know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do,	333.69388367163594
that I am entirely a stranger to what she has done; and that if she has	387.87876788239885
committed any follies, I renounce her, I abjure her, I curse her!”	482.4200343431355
“Bah!” said Athos to the commissary, “if you have no more need of me,	382.4433648952055
send me somewhere. Your Monsieur Bonacieux is very tiresome.”	395.2313896967948
The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, “Let	367.0338965464164
them be guarded more closely than ever.”	367.35457644689876
“And yet,” said Athos, with his habitual calmness, “if it be Monsieur	327.55629479036355
d’Artagnan who is concerned in this matter, I do not perceive how I can	473.074103645592
take his place.”	371.99019830806697
“Do as I bade you,” cried the commissary, “and preserve absolute	375.4859226769848
secrecy. You understand!”	300.88531857587554
Athos shrugged his shoulders, and followed his guards silently, while	475.99586912405357
M. Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger.	480.27617857212346
They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the	453.57035309949333
night, and left him to himself during the day. Bonacieux wept all day,	382.718287112092
like a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself	374.5080172528469
informed us. In the evening, about nine o’clock, at the moment he had	305.02034971410956
made up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor. These	418.8810170441299
steps drew near to his dungeon, the door was thrown open, and the	426.11355035425686
guards appeared.	358.080852687178
“Follow me,” said an officer, who came up behind the guards.	387.742037411005
“Follow you!” cried Bonacieux, “follow you at this hour! Where, my	358.0370666075855
God?”	386.8777514464524
“Where we have orders to lead you.”	403.7090123165535
“But that is not an answer.”	361.17152802016574
“It is, nevertheless, the only one we can give.”	359.4473444671601
“Ah, my God, my God!” murmured the poor mercer, “now, indeed, I am	317.79661004694555
lost!” And he followed the guards who came for him, mechanically and	415.94427942668295
without resistance.	476.3203626727719
He passed along the same corridor as before, crossed one court, then a	459.97577317108744
second side of a building; at length, at the gate of the entrance court	432.13687228509036
he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback. They made	403.7632451665869
him enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the	389.4717715233702
door was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison. The carriage	471.23688631220546
was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car. Through the closely	489.95841343073334
fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the	320.687123496196
pavement, that was all; but, true Parisian as he was, Bonacieux could	350.3048955111774
recognize every street by the milestones, the signs, and the lamps. At	359.69746107839035
the moment of arriving at St. Paul—the spot where such as were	408.07582288914296
condemned at the Bastille were executed—he was near fainting and	373.3293751576612
crossed himself twice. He thought the carriage was about to stop there.	406.4666095556762
The carriage, however, passed on.	313.69349020357475
Farther on, a still greater terror seized him on passing by the	413.3274881536554
cemetery of St. Jean, where state criminals were buried. One thing,	315.39105055270517
however, reassured him; he remembered that before they were buried	380.18561481270075
their heads were generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still	386.7627698801569
on his shoulders. But when he saw the carriage take the way to La	455.3341722270104
Grêve, when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville, and	347.60032902044844
the carriage passed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him.	443.38747015022767
He wished to confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such	392.9177661548591
pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen	453.27317273624266
him thus, he should put a gag in his mouth.	463.0674577132653
This measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux. If they meant to execute him	485.2650104333365
at La Grêve, it could scarcely be worth while to gag him, as they had	469.576016573139
nearly reached the place of execution. Indeed, the carriage crossed the	295.38522269602777
fatal spot without stopping. There remained, then, no other place to	327.74789685214137
fear but the Traitor’s Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road	417.3313693593138
to it.	449.9830585249762
This time there was no longer any doubt; it was at the Traitor’s Cross	453.9295600191832
that lesser criminals were executed. Bonacieux had flattered himself in	380.30969983399746
believing himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Grêve; it was	485.14630059801266
at the Traitor’s Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to	344.7265322086135
end! He could not yet see that dreadful cross, but he felt somehow as	402.1221434203654
if it were coming to meet him. When he was within twenty paces of it,	421.869203351348
he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped. This was more than	393.52189850634454
poor Bonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive	347.297783736882
emotions which he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which	461.2372106178865
might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted.	308.10528303000433
Chapter XIV.	370.2627800530046
THE MAN OF MEUNG	365.4609076803166
The crowd was caused, not by the expectation of a man to be hanged, but	430.525069024087
by the contemplation of a man who was hanged.	350.939896728023
The carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way,	447.0615651297427
passed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honoré, turned into the	445.99825349903404
Rue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door.	353.01313236075805
The door opened; two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the	322.6758058666732
officer who supported him. They carried him through an alley, up a	365.5927932339939
flight of stairs, and deposited him in an antechamber.	403.63642388712276
All these movements had been effected mechanically, as far as he was	468.1475086431584
concerned. He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse of	368.25531952901196
objects as through a fog. His ears had perceived sounds without	321.85445347425326
comprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without	380.6421342643508
his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to	448.02102525097143
implore mercy.	303.72033015825036
He remained on the bench, with his back leaning against the wall and	379.8571974182956
his hands hanging down, exactly on the spot where the guards placed	336.7782055605959
him.	407.09158239472407
On looking around him, however, as he could perceive no threatening	465.2070864247946
object, as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger, as the bench	340.2754282875119
was comfortably covered with a well-stuffed cushion, as the wall was	433.89064259510997
ornamented with a beautiful Cordova leather, and as large red damask	359.2801746365421
curtains, fastened back by gold clasps, floated before the window, he	479.61031632733005
perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated, and he began to	371.190244192891
turn his head to the right and the left, upward and downward.	409.7838318409928
At this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage,	359.46950878796315
and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other. At length, with the	483.2907764101119
help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench, and found	389.12217435897617
himself on his feet.	418.72466130867116
At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued	422.23068138133186
to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came	397.2792277892253
up to the prisoner. “Is your name Bonacieux?” said he.	316.6976259318673
“Yes, Monsieur Officer,” stammered the mercer, more dead than alive,	435.29748312454734
“at your service.”	485.1960278962615
“Come in,” said the officer.	435.5963342581987
And he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass. The latter obeyed	382.92066165167296
without reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be	355.5799243701051
expected.	363.33044555874505
It was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished	429.8118052374381
with arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a	386.9079547398391
fire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September. A	431.4443167741426
square table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled an	367.3998558307233
immense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the	471.0076698113412
room.	441.5645123952787
Standing before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty,	455.17959278799026
proud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which	302.0796036476456
was made still longer by a _royal_ (or _imperial_, as it is now	333.18599279885257
called), surmounted by a pair of mustaches. Although this man was	483.32310583370213
scarcely thirty-six or thirty-seven years of age, hair, mustaches, and	399.9139168674149
royal, all began to be gray. This man, except a sword, had all the	382.089795671689
appearance of a soldier; and his buff boots, still slightly covered	346.0068695014372
with dust, indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the	358.16422060461383
day.	449.5618944049535
This man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as	426.98130215600236
he is now represented—broken down like an old man, suffering like a	311.7825803585065
martyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair as	358.00684710333167
in an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his	306.85118373142006
genius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the	485.3734294192809
eternal application of his thoughts—but such as he really was at this	327.0753384382247
period; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak of	385.45825061080865
body, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the	389.15665446225455
most extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having	320.3354181835632
supported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken	404.1247029826477
Nîmes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of Ré and	459.6691011860188
lay siege to La Rochelle.	353.29058500238745
At first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for	389.5806264507403
those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.	412.43404024827475
The poor mercer remained standing at the door, while the eyes of the	440.7669393694555
personage we have just described were fixed upon him, and appeared to	449.4451470690436
wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past.	456.45919069067133
“Is this that Bonacieux?” asked he, after a moment of silence.	394.7575452951859
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the officer.	319.8756504233446
“That’s well. Give me those papers, and leave us.”	423.52000042963687
The officer took from the table the papers pointed out, gave them to	372.3824894287362
him who asked for them, bowed to the ground, and retired.	331.885558695334
Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the	458.5278960778405
Bastille. From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from	433.81262020445126
the writings, and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor	299.2948328663332
mercer.	457.99164954002566
At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination,	407.3675287534682
the cardinal was satisfied.	487.0029788516507
“That head has never conspired,” murmured he, “but it matters not; we	345.586568725681
will see.”	440.77029564617874
“You are accused of high treason,” said the cardinal, slowly.	307.40640529430664
“So I have been told already, monseigneur,” cried Bonacieux, giving his	408.8515518619207
interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him, “but I swear	423.78559799361017
to you that I know nothing about it.”	312.7526298764914
The cardinal repressed a smile.	314.24830264080043
“You have conspired with your wife, with Madame de Chevreuse, and with	321.99877896673524
my Lord Duke of Buckingham.”	430.1563031382631
“Indeed, monseigneur,” responded the mercer, “I have heard her	379.2358345722492
pronounce all those names.”	367.2271100798498
“And on what occasion?”	316.4805296871852
“She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of	353.9293057074335
Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen.”	336.3398000046876
“She said that?” cried the cardinal, with violence.	357.7112310412756
“Yes, monseigneur, but I told her she was wrong to talk about such	464.9801142947102
things; and that his Eminence was incapable—”	302.5963621720858
“Hold your tongue! You are stupid,” replied the cardinal.	364.5822708257021
“That’s exactly what my wife said, monseigneur.”	449.58074149668414
“Do you know who carried off your wife?”	437.7578221494347
“No, monseigneur.”	473.29337747423165
“You have suspicions, nevertheless?”	337.31035982311164
“Yes, monseigneur; but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to	425.33621704606685
Monsieur the Commissary, and I no longer have them.”	346.7005041892065
“Your wife has escaped. Did you know that?”	372.2922841536092
“No, monseigneur. I learned it since I have been in prison, and that	448.8798488859537
from the conversation of Monsieur the Commissary—an amiable man.”	373.08508892012173
The cardinal repressed another smile.	356.7569693401125
“Then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her	418.987419558179
flight.”	316.66911953176316
“Absolutely, monseigneur; but she has most likely returned to the	337.60556641666875
Louvre.”	366.8895399544893
“At one o’clock this morning she had not returned.”	342.0149532486859
“My God! What can have become of her, then?”	392.9337018278601
“We shall know, be assured. Nothing is concealed from the cardinal; the	404.9598137281325
cardinal knows everything.”	447.36476649337544
“In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind	397.78713619508585
as to tell me what has become of my wife?”	362.93266800397544
“Perhaps he may; but you must, in the first place, reveal to the	441.9484678680436
cardinal all you know of your wife’s relations with Madame de	475.4040130481759
Chevreuse.”	425.11088816461654
“But, monseigneur, I know nothing about them; I have never seen her.”	416.5309455439076
“When you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre, did you always	306.54681349343764
return directly home?”	411.9070278390557
“Scarcely ever; she had business to transact with linen drapers, to	478.38484971214825
whose houses I conducted her.”	475.01921708912795
“And how many were there of these linen drapers?”	459.3856621682352
“Two, monseigneur.”	342.36150143876495
“And where did they live?”	417.3594651694873
“One in Rue de Vaugirard, the other Rue de la Harpe.”	431.8110521048089
“Did you go into these houses with her?”	463.34347127403606
“Never, monseigneur; I waited at the door.”	480.5404871251367
“And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone?”	332.8663609195389
“She gave me none; she told me to wait, and I waited.”	293.1945718252843
“You are a very complacent husband, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux,” said	416.1397901962228
the cardinal.	314.0443060285484
“He calls me his dear Monsieur,” said the mercer to himself. “_Peste!_	364.29069762708286
Matters are going all right.”	439.42125481642324
“Should you know those doors again?”	474.6234304963983
“Yes.”	475.3238271257104
“Do you know the numbers?”	396.58870250843165
“Yes.”	341.3688218129678
“What are they?”	490.3350626386406
“No. 25 in the Rue de Vaugirard; 75 in the Rue de la Harpe.”	401.8532952492651
“That’s well,” said the cardinal.	488.8062997803616
At these words he took up a silver bell, and rang it; the officer	416.59933003716606
entered.	368.52185408250193
“Go,” said he, in a subdued voice, “and find Rochefort. Tell him to	292.83720901262944
come to me immediately, if he has returned.”	312.1258207407815
“The count is here,” said the officer, “and requests to speak with your	392.5425467484729
Eminence instantly.”	365.6576172382349
“Let him come in, then!” said the cardinal, quickly.	408.2031714323649
The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all	456.24901060835305
the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him.	387.57318770644395
“To your Eminence!” murmured Bonacieux, rolling his eyes round in	356.46804991927587
astonishment.	450.6226122676511
Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the	412.73077916498926
officer, when the door opened, and a new personage entered.	481.92484808650136
“It is he!” cried Bonacieux.	388.6745475053368
“He! What he?” asked the cardinal.	448.41184167785013
“The man who abducted my wife.”	488.0036145989868
The cardinal rang a second time. The officer reappeared.	334.63167178547826
“Place this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till	430.8607030206217
I send for him.”	365.56887601015075
“No, monseigneur, no, it is not he!” cried Bonacieux; “no, I was	361.58923782266913
deceived. This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all.	348.31238414065
Monsieur is, I am sure, an honest man.”	466.952311071654
“Take away that fool!” said the cardinal.	396.77182273117387
The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the	396.858448346324
antechamber, where he found his two guards.	341.9823161162616
The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his	465.7317342743751
eyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, “They have	484.81505914948775
seen each other;” said he, approaching the cardinal eagerly.	442.554220368071
“Who?” asked his Eminence.	442.49436371357694
“He and she.”	434.66948289154215
“The queen and the duke?” cried Richelieu.	398.4592205110987
“Yes.”	346.2023320208362
“Where?”	340.1559116902682
“At the Louvre.”	365.9134569596364
“Are you sure of it?”	354.1349219754717
“Perfectly sure.”	428.7269272068585
“Who told you of it?”	377.43388867144824
“Madame de Lannoy, who is devoted to your Eminence, as you know.”	483.60313750995397
“Why did she not let me know sooner?”	414.84247684655935
“Whether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep	355.04068301416527
in her chamber, and detained her all day.”	428.66848575259087
“Well, we are beaten! Now let us try to take our revenge.”	460.1058565555145
“I will assist you with all my heart, monseigneur; be assured of that.”	361.52408255206785
“How did it come about?”	371.43652191226806
“At half past twelve the queen was with her women—”	438.688697631437
“Where?”	416.05522004600505
“In her bedchamber—”	425.20427204886516
“Go on.”	330.00144812972945
“When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress.”	425.2728584668656
“And then?”	365.3692979711763
“The queen immediately exhibited strong emotion; and despite the rouge	343.16712268418155
with which her face was covered evidently turned pale—”	409.6393930157167
“And then, and then?”	303.10048351809405
“She then arose, and with altered voice, ‘Ladies,’ said she, ‘wait for	319.96443238694474
me ten minutes, I shall soon return.’ She then opened the door of her	400.545630697869
alcove, and went out.”	481.8605404657942
“Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly?”	361.6157290488671
“Nothing was certain; besides, her Majesty had said, ‘Ladies, wait for	353.4505499237613
me,’ and she did not dare to disobey the queen.”	344.5989360115149
“How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?”	395.33691324157394
“Three-quarters of an hour.”	323.70459840742103
“None of her women accompanied her?”	436.4537602464717
“Only Donna Estafania.”	329.872277680199
“Did she afterward return?”	417.8367094137891
“Yes; but only to take a little rosewood casket, with her cipher upon	473.94964211990504
it, and went out again immediately.”	295.6687195568121
“And when she finally returned, did she bring that casket with her?”	301.3800069763133
“No.”	350.43121401859
“Does Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket?”	359.840842466167
“Yes; the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the queen.”	437.8191679743543
“And she came back without this casket?”	387.87275751638526
“Yes.”	488.78811425796266
“Madame de Lannoy, then, is of opinion that she gave them to	386.82059528271066
Buckingham?”	424.5704729708715
“She is sure of it.”	465.55781358613694
“How can she be so?”	342.2260616172006
“In the course of the day Madame de Lannoy, in her quality of	457.1784519931398
tire-woman of the queen, looked for this casket, appeared uneasy at not	404.708444725723
finding it, and at length asked information of the queen.”	326.14460037726195
“And then the queen?”	375.5911694503044
“The queen became exceedingly red, and replied that having in the	412.68295563936
evening broken one of those studs, she had sent it to her goldsmith to	467.6617867399908
be repaired.”	423.53972707695846
“He must be called upon, and so ascertain if the thing be true or not.”	413.81322964680623
“I have just been with him.”	458.4161025100585
“And the goldsmith?”	390.0663102806145
“The goldsmith has heard nothing of it.”	414.05086125283106
“Well, well! Rochefort, all is not lost; and perhaps—perhaps everything	299.8845848147367
is for the best.”	426.83326050270784
“The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminence’s genius—”	332.91415993480996
“Will repair the blunders of his agent—is that it?”	397.36979490999136
“That is exactly what I was going to say, if your Eminence had let me	428.2419481880931
finish my sentence.”	343.2424392037133
“Meanwhile, do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	342.0332026882866
Buckingham are now concealed?”	318.1897546160105
“No, monseigneur; my people could tell me nothing on that head.”	349.31341579544085
“But I know.”	397.3517431866464
“You, monseigneur?”	433.101796642308
“Yes; or at least I guess. They were, one in the Rue de Vaugirard, No.	415.1768580173651
25; the other in the Rue de la Harpe, No. 75.”	357.850612310439
“Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested?”	421.4391655597813
“It will be too late; they will be gone.”	368.6361189493348
“But still, we can make sure that they are so.”	419.4565847938211
“Take ten men of my Guardsmen, and search the two houses thoroughly.”	346.02444310660087
“Instantly, monseigneur.” And Rochefort went hastily out of the	454.9964649609113
apartment.	448.2246145659791
The cardinal, being left alone, reflected for an instant and then rang	294.0684157265353
the bell a third time. The same officer appeared.	336.0906124503841
“Bring the prisoner in again,” said the cardinal.	346.70528955248386
M. Bonacieux was introduced afresh, and upon a sign from the cardinal,	332.3383442480099
the officer retired.	394.915595401507
“You have deceived me!” said the cardinal, sternly.	345.4385845333743
“I,” cried Bonacieux, “I deceive your Eminence!”	396.0829458132719
“Your wife, in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe, did not	356.63023320918984
go to find linen drapers.”	369.1385542496473
“Then why did she go, just God?”	382.4822216540232
“She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	482.6836019598908
Buckingham.”	354.3853495452019
“Yes,” cried Bonacieux, recalling all his remembrances of the	301.1417071768319
circumstances, “yes, that’s it. Your Eminence is right. I told my wife	488.20959675564313
several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in	302.5963885490397
such houses as those, in houses that had no signs; but she always	470.12871834064043
laughed at me. Ah, monseigneur!” continued Bonacieux, throwing himself	347.83693948145293
at his Eminence’s feet, “ah, how truly you are the cardinal, the great	440.7775765928818
cardinal, the man of genius whom all the world reveres!”	411.583965491183
The cardinal, however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so	442.5300918810341
vulgar a being as Bonacieux, did not the less enjoy it for an instant;	482.5067912790267
then, almost immediately, as if a fresh thought has occurred, a smile	302.7450044502498
played upon his lips, and he said, offering his hand to the mercer,	394.7475965361241
“Rise, my friend, you are a worthy man.”	438.68467806388213
“The cardinal has touched me with his hand! I have touched the hand of	352.3825231115315
the great man!” cried Bonacieux. “The great man has called me his	474.98779154532565
friend!”	308.7628733043306
“Yes, my friend, yes,” said the cardinal, with that paternal tone which	342.1727182802956
he sometimes knew how to assume, but which deceived none who knew him;	483.9684224712847
“and as you have been unjustly suspected, well, you must be	430.74324147347454
indemnified. Here, take this purse of a hundred pistoles, and pardon	323.5305509770659
me.”	333.59918766483827
“I pardon you, monseigneur!” said Bonacieux, hesitating to take the	485.6955824731879
purse, fearing, doubtless, that this pretended gift was but a	332.6119777034745
pleasantry. “But you are able to have me arrested, you are able to have	359.68999460244834
me tortured, you are able to have me hanged; you are the master, and I	306.1831485752738
could not have the least word to say. Pardon you, monseigneur! You	416.6598856714676
cannot mean that!”	359.55282000962984
“Ah, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, you are generous in this matter. I see	384.16672306909095
it and I thank you for it. Thus, then, you will take this bag, and you	356.4119105469471
will go away without being too malcontent.”	335.62744092496996
“I go away enchanted.”	481.58699630377413
“Farewell, then, or rather, _au revoir_, for I hope we shall meet	396.4484029849033
again.”	296.8545571446443
“Whenever Monseigneur wishes, I am always at at his Eminence’s orders.”	437.4538264059444
“That will be frequently, I assure you, for I have found something	404.3722020396066
extremely agreeable in your conversation.”	434.8218156573794
“Oh! Monseigneur!”	357.7618259640912
“_Au revoir_, Monsieur Bonacieux, _au revoir!_”	328.3574174624328
And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux	334.87129925858414
replied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he	473.92768973880743
was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm,	403.01580666447
crying aloud, “Long life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence!	454.7125642085357
Long life to the great cardinal!” The cardinal listened with a smile to	416.4415584054478
this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and	347.52966695206635
then, when Bonacieux’s cries were no longer audible, “Good!” said he,	359.52107445874304
“that man would henceforward lay down his life for me.” And the	402.20684472043024
cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of La	379.72191767146086
Rochelle, which, as we have said, lay open on the desk, tracing with a	399.8270703073401
pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which, eighteen	457.7369096896091
months later, shut up the port of the besieged city. As he was in the	319.1444047513797
deepest of his strategic meditations, the door opened, and Rochefort	318.88925508301674
returned.	452.90587363452505
“Well?” said the cardinal, eagerly, rising with a promptitude which	429.22862256248834
proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with	353.14257783051323
which he had charged the count.	461.8782879043547
“Well,” said the latter, “a young woman of about twenty-six or	367.0005068617279
twenty-eight years of age, and a man of from thirty-five to forty, have	293.3946462422226
indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence; but the	398.55576154869607
woman left last night, and the man this morning.”	490.50997048117245
“It was they!” cried the cardinal, looking at the clock; “and now it is	440.48245331418906
too late to have them pursued. The duchess is at Tours, and the duke at	373.07873684232345
Boulogne. It is in London they must be found.”	454.99452478926804
“What are your Eminence’s orders?”	318.27065012435344
“Not a word of what has passed. Let the queen remain in perfect	335.5805631382307
security; let her be ignorant that we know her secret. Let her believe	417.4421061869982
that we are in search of some conspiracy or other. Send me the keeper	326.7811847218755
of the seals, Séguier.”	314.53751105473145
“And that man, what has your Eminence done with him?”	394.8262973704059
“What man?” asked the cardinal.	427.8022608596541
“That Bonacieux.”	467.04231836712233
“I have done with him all that could be done. I have made him a spy	475.97737757696905
upon his wife.”	308.5756023254673
The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the	370.1752544165093
superiority of the master as great, and retired.	334.65071983791586
Left alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which	385.3450977696882
he secured with his special seal. Then he rang. The officer entered for	406.56723330895704
the fourth time.	336.57208659770447
“Tell Vitray to come to me,” said he, “and tell him to get ready for a	374.83636118785955
journey.”	329.25124163233676
An instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and	481.7134738968891
spurred.	359.61912126764196
“Vitray,” said he, “you will go with all speed to London. You must not	466.1358192159694
stop an instant on the way. You will deliver this letter to Milady.	364.67116883150317
Here is an order for two hundred pistoles; call upon my treasurer and	319.2743543972161
get the money. You shall have as much again if you are back within six	399.5400313476875
days, and have executed your commission well.”	446.3544508761581
The messenger, without replying a single word, bowed, took the letter,	327.2214305718771
with the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired.	365.1728614948534
Here is what the letter contained:	323.37517726931947
MILADY, Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be	484.48378274252195
present. He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near	320.6473528145802
to him as you can, and cut off two.	373.5502396896977
As soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.	398.6982217860673
Chapter XV.	447.36677116638054
MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD	333.6895845938078
On the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having	456.94741677168565
reappeared, M. de Tréville was informed by D’Artagnan and Porthos of	409.606846825395
the circumstance. As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for	437.71336643284883
five days, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business.	449.9706525719258
M. de Tréville was the father of his soldiers. The lowest or the least	296.57925627024935
known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as	424.7011266761242
sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.	482.3775663518744
He repaired, then, instantly to the office of the	303.1634096090791
_lieutenant-criminel_. The officer who commanded the post of the Red	481.7732471361236
Cross was sent for, and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos	321.51548659796697
was then lodged in Fort l’Evêque.	400.4757795631978
Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux	445.02942556698827
undergo.	485.59225569398006
We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted	420.77250018335826
with each other. Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear	313.92843662445955
that D’Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time	300.39296714665335
necessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not	298.13577849112636
D’Artagnan. He added that he did not know either M. or Mme. Bonacieux;	430.9735372509975
that he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at	441.1827719507606
about ten o’clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M.	429.8547045871808
d’Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Tréville’s,	410.9713198549319
where he had dined. “Twenty witnesses,” added he, “could attest the	375.7405288544961
fact”; and he named several distinguished gentlemen, and among them was	378.9123274965216
M. le Duc de la Trémouille.	361.34708675876703
The second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by	432.42908585142334
the simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was	312.40307502584204
anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to	335.2976285354992
gain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Tréville, and that of	407.66986500870803
M. de la Trémouille, commanded a little reflection.	397.7016892066998
Athos was then sent to the cardinal; but unfortunately the cardinal was	470.3091320446034
at the Louvre with the king.	415.9837556062541
It was precisely at this moment that M. de Tréville, on leaving the	313.54090212301503
residence of the _lieutenant-criminel_ and the governor of Fort	476.3529499224634
l’Evêque without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace.	331.7243082933508
As captain of the Musketeers, M. de Tréville had the right of entry at	292.1521936206048
all times.	432.77416525612745
It is well known how violent the king’s prejudices were against the	317.23003989065927
queen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal,	411.5480880011304
who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men.	424.7508918146448
One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of	444.54666355877043
Austria for Mme. de Chevreuse. These two women gave him more uneasiness	335.50119237458085
than the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment	347.2348200012717
of the finances. In his eyes and to his conviction, Mme. de Chevreuse	465.77583569149874
not only served the queen in her political intrigues, but, what	382.3654406829835
tormented him still more, in her amorous intrigues.	444.4180113925502
At the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme. de Chevreuse—who, though	442.7525925274439
exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris,	299.81803627410983
remained there five days, and outwitted the police—the king flew into a	378.35115786117984
furious passion. Capricious and unfaithful, the king wished to be	337.7208731769452
called Louis the Just and Louis the Chaste. Posterity will find a	437.7301446318833
difficulty in understanding this character, which history explains only	363.25905348793196
by facts and never by reason.	413.72447359591723
But when the cardinal added that not only Mme. de Chevreuse had been in	461.5402670256524
Paris, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of	344.13332678017485
those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a	410.2525276938759
_cabal;_ when he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel	429.57848697701377
the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of	368.12352904887075
arresting in the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queen’s	381.36695725023054
emissary to the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the	306.3092389226972
course of justice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest	322.51497633744236
men of the law, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair	430.04278906144935
in order to place it before the eyes of the king—Louis XIII. could not	482.25356379540926
contain himself, and he made a step toward the queen’s apartment with	374.65120880473364
that pale and mute indignation which, when it broke out, led this	294.1689727260907
prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty. And yet, in all	456.91285215756034
this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of	324.2751043735298
Buckingham.	362.38259223099953
At this instant M. de Tréville entered, cool, polite, and in	364.25365776972455
irreproachable costume.	487.4926372955506
Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the	462.76232548151273
alteration in the king’s countenance, M. de Tréville felt himself	409.7452741232107
something like Samson before the Philistines.	304.6388072814065
Louis XIII. had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the	467.2764284304453
noise of M. de Tréville’s entrance he turned round. “You arrive in good	419.70685515348936
time, monsieur,” said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a	484.0626679567665
certain point, could not dissemble; “I have learned some fine things	356.97785237042297
concerning your Musketeers.”	392.8209730561989
“And I,” said Tréville, coldly, “I have some pretty things to tell your	336.148739827549
Majesty concerning these gownsmen.”	386.02881472119077
“What?” said the king, with hauteur.	298.1492827543605
“I have the honor to inform your Majesty,” continued M. de Tréville, in	328.7463151302418
the same tone, “that a party of _procureurs_, commissaries, and men of	477.1501058603534
the police—very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears,	478.11917386446703
against the uniform—have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to	450.7865398243547
lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l’Evêque, all	455.49835488188216
upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather	432.0629657977869
your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost	313.60437423204644
illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur	373.10745740207517
Athos.”	467.60761565248913
“Athos,” said the king, mechanically; “yes, certainly I know that	420.02552683223416
name.”	305.3605249247324
“Let your Majesty remember,” said Tréville, “that Monsieur Athos is the	456.1709148779813
Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had	443.3726154263385
the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously. _A propos_,	308.4343604614257
monseigneur,” continued Tréville, addressing the cardinal, “Monsieur de	399.6380879520859
Cahusac is quite recovered, is he not?”	323.2155412253124
“Thank you,” said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger.	328.9473172402884
“Athos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the	314.0074662585238
time,” continued Tréville, “to a young Béarnais, a cadet in his	317.1733406263025
Majesty’s Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely had	342.0788075110844
he arrived at his friend’s and taken up a book, while waiting his	431.25844361979966
return, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege	453.1446350463043
to the house, broke open several doors—”	366.4557625621642
The cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, “That was on	367.79142652478225
account of the affair about which I spoke to you.”	350.91386712392045
“We all know that,” interrupted the king; “for all that was done for	370.9400211916393
our service.”	387.8462453004566
“Then,” said Tréville, “it was also for your Majesty’s service that one	342.8950224840504
of my Musketeers, who was innocent, has been seized, that he has been	299.2026826357863
placed between two guards like a malefactor, and that this gallant man,	469.1803324698427
who has ten times shed his blood in your Majesty’s service and is ready	312.58709060968874
to shed it again, has been paraded through the midst of an insolent	420.42274301224984
populace?”	400.7243328135412
“Bah!” said the king, who began to be shaken, “was it so managed?”	301.4389811733565
“Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm,	323.8649733433786
“does not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant	427.2465507584709
man, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries	451.7526290428075
of inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of	293.76751755999794
the highest importance.”	381.7119548133787
“I defy your Eminence to prove it,” cried Tréville, with his Gascon	346.4150104235838
freedom and military frankness; “for one hour before, Monsieur Athos,	379.306043310012
who, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest	398.1495467147581
quality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing	358.1304636013537
in the saloon of my hôtel, with the Duc de la Trémouille and the Comte	476.2157019530995
de Châlus, who happened to be there.”	454.0235787772118
The king looked at the cardinal.	438.629589763652
“A written examination attests it,” said the cardinal, replying aloud	337.84551029105626
to the mute interrogation of his Majesty; “and the ill-treated people	445.1286261009509
have drawn up the following, which I have the honor to present to your	469.7872845082609
Majesty.”	487.1112170470845
“And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison	297.4847136623324
with the word of honor of a swordsman?” replied Tréville haughtily.	355.46912486149665
“Come, come, Tréville, hold your tongue,” said the king.	321.25895496833317
“If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my	439.71182319019357
Musketeers,” said Tréville, “the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so	448.2824450542306
well known that I demand an inquiry.”	294.3949496286021
“In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made,” continued the	375.34066409021136
impassive cardinal, “there lodges, I believe, a young Béarnais, a	468.69062599328043
friend of the Musketeer.”	441.64784416935606
“Your Eminence means Monsieur d’Artagnan.”	432.08615311318323
“I mean a young man whom you patronize, Monsieur de Tréville.”	410.53206497217417
“Yes, your Eminence, it is the same.”	406.33528299622265
“Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?”	296.140980689023
“To Athos, to a man double his age?” interrupted Tréville. “No,	424.85991086106105
monseigneur. Besides, D’Artagnan passed the evening with me.”	395.2543537719714
“Well,” said the cardinal, “everybody seems to have passed the evening	395.6478594255652
with you.”	461.80564915952186
“Does your Eminence doubt my word?” said Tréville, with a brow flushed	397.5908871292817
with anger.	451.13678550051037
“No, God forbid,” said the cardinal; “only, at what hour was he with	334.32395317051703
you?”	305.7957817148241
“Oh, as to that I can speak positively, your Eminence; for as he came	481.0201117457063
in I remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock, although I	307.7954057183122
had believed it to be later.”	488.2246952283773
“At what hour did he leave your hôtel?”	307.302460040523
“At half past ten—an hour after the event.”	435.12998629590703
“Well,” replied the cardinal, who could not for an instant suspect the	420.964953250597
loyalty of Tréville, and who felt that the victory was escaping him,	437.82931582889927
“well, but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoyeurs.”	396.3569299726506
“Is one friend forbidden to visit another, or a Musketeer of my company	341.48157227001064
to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessart’s company?”	442.0077283456051
“Yes, when the house where he fraternizes is suspected.”	319.80890608965257
“That house is suspected, Tréville,” said the king; “perhaps you did	301.7137185367722
not know it?”	377.5215614782221
“Indeed, sire, I did not. The house may be suspected; but I deny that	397.6648021440896
it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d’Artagnan, for I can	296.25689564946646
affirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist	425.0220419920134
a more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of	385.2629470743153
Monsieur the Cardinal.”	365.7192615501159
“Was it not this D’Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that	304.7960807809716
unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the	458.05551263838356
Carmes-Déchaussés?” asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who	397.3345567025125
colored with vexation.	434.413006111114
“And the next day, Bernajoux. Yes, sire, yes, it is the same; and your	420.0943633400914
Majesty has a good memory.”	435.85020868790434
“Come, how shall we decide?” said the king.	327.62395285759857
“That concerns your Majesty more than me,” said the cardinal. “I should	379.2464393170088
affirm the culpability.”	422.4031184901771
“And I deny it,” said Tréville. “But his Majesty has judges, and these	400.90621823341525
judges will decide.”	292.39975312134476
“That is best,” said the king. “Send the case before the judges; it is	415.4152625728142
their business to judge, and they shall judge.”	327.0137411493828
“Only,” replied Tréville, “it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate	457.9694436380156
times in which we live, the purest life, the most incontestable virtue,	449.61791228512465
cannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution. The army, I will	384.0351969192309
answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous	388.51500810366787
treatment on account of police affairs.”	430.54508647659804
The expression was imprudent; but M. de Tréville launched it with	305.8255278941195
knowledge of his cause. He was desirous of an explosion, because in	436.6763040830506
that case the mine throws forth fire, and fire enlightens.	326.61951719482494
“Police affairs!” cried the king, taking up Tréville’s words, “police	301.09356209194704
affairs! And what do you know about them, Monsieur? Meddle with your	352.37795097664343
Musketeers, and do not annoy me in this way. It appears, according to	466.31122339994477
your account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is	313.1031491057038
in danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them,	330.69989371708925
_ventrebleu_, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a	467.2731918354341
whisper.”	449.08842218490486
“From the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,” said Tréville,	313.2453413732131
“the Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender	413.0361909321645
my sword—for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt	300.9187772713006
that Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me. It is best to	346.07196811917765
constitute myself at once a prisoner with Athos, who is already	349.3293951764809
arrested, and with D’Artagnan, who most probably will be.”	442.85671992911915
“Gascon-headed man, will you have done?” said the king.	313.87179097508323
“Sire,” replied Tréville, without lowering his voice in the least,	401.52183238830526
“either order my Musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried.”	472.2057328374367
“He shall be tried,” said the cardinal.	399.9165204741027
“Well, so much the better; for in that case I shall demand of his	490.85649941330917
Majesty permission to plead for him.”	335.58177769020136
The king feared an outbreak.	368.46189203692285
“If his Eminence,” said he, “did not have personal motives—”	467.23103547409494
The cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:	367.986264377305
“Pardon me,” said he; “but the instant your Majesty considers me a	377.7942560589478
prejudiced judge, I withdraw.”	364.83594331071845
“Come,” said the king, “will you swear, by my father, that Athos was at	434.12973947948456
your residence during the event and that he took no part in it?”	302.8185053173876
“By your glorious father, and by yourself, whom I love and venerate	296.0418471856381
above all the world, I swear it.”	464.10702496678766
“Be so kind as to reflect, sire,” said the cardinal. “If we release the	471.54202208781237
prisoner thus, we shall never know the truth.”	472.03255100318296
“Athos may always be found,” replied Tréville, “ready to answer, when	334.0840383656491
it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him. He will not desert,	343.2167482692662
Monsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him.”	299.44213387931893
“No, he will not desert,” said the king; “he can always be found, as	371.3830513621873
Tréville says. Besides,” added he, lowering his voice and looking with	353.3540464420557
a suppliant air at the cardinal, “let us give them apparent security;	295.4781033090482
that is policy.”	405.89835826878823
This policy of Louis XIII. made Richelieu smile.	303.7979730929665
“Order it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon.”	319.01930018152865
“The right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,” said Tréville, who	463.92399982622305
was determined to have the last word, “and my Musketeer is innocent. It	323.14991056832764
is not mercy, then, that you are about to accord, sire, it is justice.”	383.2262106499973
“And he is in the Fort l’Evêque?” said the king.	377.8931536956762
“Yes, sire, in solitary confinement, in a dungeon, like the lowest	410.81225807599435
criminal.”	415.47130538658575
“The devil!” murmured the king; “what must be done?”	358.9787932065118
“Sign an order for his release, and all will be said,” replied the	332.5531951222665
cardinal. “I believe with your Majesty that Monsieur de Tréville’s	384.0342896185967
guarantee is more than sufficient.”	463.2678131874591
Tréville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with	348.43775369481745
fear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of	357.16631066119453
the cardinal to this sudden yielding.	330.2704477918379
The king signed the order for release, and Tréville carried it away	435.4939010685212
without delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave	459.45372908317944
him a friendly smile, and said, “A perfect harmony reigns, sire,	465.22281816656476
between the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be	335.50026341515024
profitable for the service and honorable to all.”	444.4408045441013
“He will play me some dog’s trick or other, and that immediately,” said	347.66074666547786
Tréville. “One has never the last word with such a man. But let us be	348.0229759327618
quick—the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is	299.8429797083866
more difficult to replace a man in the Fort l’Evêque or the Bastille	307.3030085437601
who has got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in.”	477.01490551505276
M. de Tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the Fort l’Evêque,	417.25598579538394
whence he delivered the Musketeer, whose peaceful indifference had not	354.71790612209804
for a moment abandoned him.	452.04478974669735
The first time he saw D’Artagnan, “You have come off well,” said he to	299.1340587240964
him; “there is your Jussac thrust paid for. There still remains that of	323.09247906686477
Bernajoux, but you must not be too confident.”	306.3686057953773
As to the rest, M. de Tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal	354.0069448244173
and to think that all was not over, for scarcely had the captain of the	459.85637572065076
Musketeers closed the door after him, than his Eminence said to the	361.4340073876896
king, “Now that we are at length by ourselves, we will, if your Majesty	441.7345722053491
pleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five	396.5725145421197
days, and only left this morning.”	473.8092891638063
Chapter XVI.	432.17896158888146
IN WHICH M. SÉGUIER, KEEPER OF THE SEALS, LOOKS MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE	458.40151749605144
BELL	486.04314209511347
It is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made	484.10466194319827
upon Louis XIII. He grew pale and red alternately; and the cardinal saw	437.1555096126756
at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had	491.3202767685323
lost.	312.2722601913392
“Buckingham in Paris!” cried he, “and why does he come?”	438.57255025791846
“To conspire, no doubt, with your enemies, the Huguenots and the	479.23647605950566
Spaniards.”	304.1156332004402
“No, _pardieu_, no! To conspire against my honor with Madame de	486.8170401148075
Chevreuse, Madame de Longueville, and the Condés.”	334.5988882416691
“Oh, sire, what an idea! The queen is too virtuous; and besides, loves	482.25100024451467
your Majesty too well.”	365.2894570852839
“Woman is weak, Monsieur Cardinal,” said the king; “and as to loving me	453.03523344691575
much, I have my own opinion as to that love.”	438.0970869937948
“I not the less maintain,” said the cardinal, “that the Duke of	407.3409433898282
Buckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political.”	361.7150499290458
“And I am sure that he came for quite another purpose, Monsieur	458.1854639960833
Cardinal; but if the queen be guilty, let her tremble!”	327.8694522158082
“Indeed,” said the cardinal, “whatever repugnance I may have to	413.8134674887142
directing my mind to such a treason, your Majesty compels me to think	355.7175181680662
of it. Madame de Lannoy, whom, according to your Majesty’s command, I	384.3308163912844
have frequently interrogated, told me this morning that the night	332.0847039634709
before last her Majesty sat up very late, that this morning she wept	371.4789736622595
much, and that she was writing all day.”	458.7877396806497
“That’s it!” cried the king; “to him, no doubt. Cardinal, I must have	332.16263347828624
the queen’s papers.”	300.2744058398444
“But how to take them, sire? It seems to me that it is neither your	414.32792642255345
Majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission.”	376.58015489932427
“How did they act with regard to the Maréchale d’Ancre?” cried the	312.64041541069054
king, in the highest state of choler; “first her closets were	377.05587619188503
thoroughly searched, and then she herself.”	431.0803913273363
“The Maréchale d’Ancre was no more than the Maréchale d’Ancre. A	396.04950073115185
Florentine adventurer, sire, and that was all; while the august spouse	302.48637153135866
of your Majesty is Anne of Austria, Queen of France—that is to say, one	316.4685767538102
of the greatest princesses in the world.”	476.16773443244347
“She is not the less guilty, Monsieur Duke! The more she has forgotten	305.57282573978927
the high position in which she was placed, the more degrading is her	437.5936879699113
fall. Besides, I long ago determined to put an end to all these petty	440.95560039485656
intrigues of policy and love. She has near her a certain Laporte.”	360.2990982655796
“Who, I believe, is the mainspring of all this, I confess,” said the	465.1520432245129
cardinal.	350.4645489456061
“You think then, as I do, that she deceives me?” said the king.	321.24761914351797
“I believe, and I repeat it to your Majesty, that the queen conspires	340.3461520828601
against the power of the king, but I have not said against his honor.”	454.498858081398
“And I—I tell you against both. I tell you the queen does not love me;	428.9934392309224
I tell you she loves another; I tell you she loves that infamous	387.41588690447315
Buckingham! Why did you not have him arrested while in Paris?”	389.4863688682437
“Arrest the Duke! Arrest the prime minister of King Charles I.! Think	296.170349682779
of it, sire! What a scandal! And if the suspicions of your Majesty,	408.1562629117626
which I still continue to doubt, should prove to have any foundation,	387.2843464569937
what a terrible disclosure, what a fearful scandal!”	353.15409614832055
“But as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief, he should have	318.462726660745
been—”	363.136573075558
Louis XIII. stopped, terrified at what he was about to say, while	486.0216629281124
Richelieu, stretching out his neck, waited uselessly for the word which	294.4511703321369
had died on the lips of the king.	365.07947193291506
“He should have been—?”	374.9889273476432
“Nothing,” said the king, “nothing. But all the time he was in Paris,	392.98734158260197
you, of course, did not lose sight of him?”	449.80643886379573
“No, sire.”	474.0920466219684
“Where did he lodge?”	350.18444809721456
“Rue de la Harpe. No. 75.”	370.7164068685339
“Where is that?”	444.12304257465405
“By the side of the Luxembourg.”	439.1686154362651
“And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?”	357.0270793051496
“I believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty, sire.”	427.4824137402916
“But they have corresponded; it is to him that the queen has been	366.93566706041224
writing all the day. Monsieur Duke, I must have those letters!”	351.7811346145597
“Sire, notwithstanding—”	307.83779288252526
“Monsieur Duke, at whatever price it may be, I will have them.”	344.95877440176366
“I would, however, beg your Majesty to observe—”	369.5057907298635
“Do you, then, also join in betraying me, Monsieur Cardinal, by thus	300.8255075585049
always opposing my will? Are you also in accord with Spain and England,	433.5534676692225
with Madame de Chevreuse and the queen?”	451.0711117753864
“Sire,” replied the cardinal, sighing, “I believed myself secure from	389.35434649927396
such a suspicion.”	306.3916500007704
“Monsieur Cardinal, you have heard me; I will have those letters.”	331.8924141275764
“There is but one way.”	382.7465960230767
“What is that?”	359.4209893931828
“That would be to charge Monsieur de Séguier, the keeper of the seals,	390.7136060586543
with this mission. The matter enters completely into the duties of the	411.90926479507505
post.”	394.180758261107
“Let him be sent for instantly.”	330.8288425781793
“He is most likely at my hôtel. I requested him to call, and when I	350.84271099562693
came to the Louvre I left orders if he came, to desire him to wait.”	325.8565267751722
“Let him be sent for instantly.”	438.7123079317007
“Your Majesty’s orders shall be executed; but—”	304.7654994149796
“But what?”	355.3819923685718
“But the queen will perhaps refuse to obey.”	371.0920177157904
“My orders?”	351.07945894629233
“Yes, if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king.”	361.8353676737136
“Well, that she may have no doubt on that head, I will go and inform	443.2030268794372
her myself.”	430.9626168627614
“Your Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power	459.4160778942261
to prevent a rupture.”	314.51012290952826
“Yes, Duke, yes, I know you are very indulgent toward the queen, too	442.77637496719296
indulgent, perhaps; we shall have occasion, I warn you, at some future	324.537341234564
period to speak of that.”	317.07692883475323
“Whenever it shall please your Majesty; but I shall be always happy and	425.0929609524177
proud, sire, to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see	392.51015438391136
reign between you and the Queen of France.”	392.27813718981935
“Very well, Cardinal, very well; but, meantime, send for Monsieur the	314.04269526115223
Keeper of the Seals. I will go to the queen.”	446.810604195112
And Louis XIII., opening the door of communication, passed into the	390.489144037683
corridor which led from his apartments to those of Anne of Austria.	320.62673175836926
The queen was in the midst of her women—Mme. de Guitaut, Mme. de Sable,	435.00348197558446
Mme. de Montbazon, and Mme. de Guémené. In a corner was the Spanish	359.4760529351564
companion, Donna Estafania, who had followed her from Madrid. Mme.	477.42107794591925
Guémené was reading aloud, and everybody was listening to her with	395.2954106027926
attention with the exception of the queen, who had, on the contrary,	482.8488085216675
desired this reading in order that she might be able, while feigning to	423.20962421389356
listen, to pursue the thread of her own thoughts.	452.34881649465694
These thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were	382.8877617916868
not the less sad. Anne of Austria, deprived of the confidence of her	328.5621097621696
husband, pursued by the hatred of the cardinal, who could not pardon	396.67249433335064
her for having repulsed a more tender feeling, having before her eyes	346.0907625896614
the example of the queen-mother whom that hatred had tormented all her	294.7152999237489
life—though Marie de Médicis, if the memoirs of the time are to be	456.9305492681244
believed, had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which	388.5680340429816
Anne of Austria always refused him—Anne of Austria had seen her most	418.6749906155249
devoted servants fall around her, her most intimate confidants, her	481.12994744751524
dearest favorites. Like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal	338.18898072708265
gift, she brought misfortune upon everything she touched. Her	319.1142841290697
friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution. Mme. de	373.93813583062024
Chevreuse and Mme. de Bernet were exiled, and Laporte did not conceal	434.93286049043667
from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant.	487.5194288357035
It was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of	312.94453159660895
these reflections that the door of the chamber opened, and the king	361.44147328474446
entered.	392.95820403410715
The reader hushed herself instantly. All the ladies rose, and there was	457.98559790009267
a profound silence. As to the king, he made no demonstration of	299.9977956054144
politeness, only stopping before the queen. “Madame,” said he, “you are	435.60803725582446
about to receive a visit from the chancellor, who will communicate	295.91679400856765
certain matters to you with which I have charged him.”	445.64521583031785
The unfortunate queen, who was constantly threatened with divorce,	367.2521380141344
exile, and trial even, turned pale under her rouge, and could not	452.26864270871516
refrain from saying, “But why this visit, sire? What can the chancellor	457.9191486494408
have to say to me that your Majesty could not say yourself?”	489.12424832789077
The king turned upon his heel without reply, and almost at the same	362.1617008370598
instant the captain of the Guards, M. de Guitant, announced the visit	335.18528330358174
of the chancellor.	446.21211713078833
When the chancellor appeared, the king had already gone out by another	417.38587011770414
door.	475.8233670657755
The chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing. As we shall	365.7733447154443
probably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be	484.2194494659862
well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him.	313.38517751456914
This chancellor was a pleasant man. He was Des Roches le Masle, canon	332.4441304988029
of Notre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced	306.50589091160623
him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout man. The cardinal trusted	465.9342440528221
him, and therein found his advantage.	317.35631938317647
There are many stories related of him, and among them this. After a	347.5710997422278
wild youth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least	388.1222698712213
for some time, the follies of adolescence. On entering this holy place,	480.7415488716375
the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent	419.0113603514468
the passions he fled from entering with him. He was incessantly	313.49783975379034
attacked by them, and the superior, to whom he had confided this	365.7899730424456
misfortune, wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them, had	347.62482277103385
advised him, in order to conjure away the tempting demon, to have	368.45024930551835
recourse to the bell rope, and ring with all his might. At the	452.6560701073556
denunciating sound, the monks would be rendered aware that temptation	405.0413313159547
was besieging a brother, and all the community would go to prayers.	299.60281359573554
This advice appeared good to the future chancellor. He conjured the	351.0521395648028
evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks. But the	440.0221786126916
devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in	319.9163294979611
which he has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the	325.9512312845678
exorcisms he redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell	382.55848856050943
was ringing full swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification	301.3617570341237
which the penitent experienced.	321.93480665240594
The monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing	412.9352845074843
but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in	298.4512857273144
addition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap	413.9007233466581
twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of	311.0459246843314
their cells.	415.21221069640023
It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who	468.60227762002125
grew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the	356.92471769366847
world with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that	360.91505243415975
ever existed.	308.51079787591306
On leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy, became president	423.7539697914117
on the place of his uncle, embraced the cardinal’s party, which did not	325.83043610881526
prove want of sagacity, became chancellor, served his Eminence with	325.6278817843795
zeal in his hatred against the queen-mother and his vengeance against	343.7771599869463
Anne of Austria, stimulated the judges in the affair of Calais,	438.2572753852405
encouraged the attempts of M. de Laffemas, chief gamekeeper of France;	300.9898041807546
then, at length, invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal—a	445.87450037349674
confidence which he had so well earned—he received the singular	395.4065957458483
commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the	477.83293743950134
queen’s apartments.	307.28637562264146
The queen was still standing when he entered; but scarcely had she	338.4690782676377
perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair, and made a	319.4271436160144
sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools, and with an air	433.2292121104723
of supreme hauteur, said, “What do you desire, monsieur, and with what	338.8322409623841
object do you present yourself here?”	350.10229477688785
“To make, madame, in the name of the king, and without prejudice to the	338.19162831396767
respect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close	476.2098979888884
examination into all your papers.”	293.4708728073963
“How, monsieur, an investigation of my papers—mine! Truly, this is an	331.03621814587893
indignity!”	361.06927880021914
“Be kind enough to pardon me, madame; but in this circumstance I am but	325.6761415154048
the instrument which the king employs. Has not his Majesty just left	416.64445380201596
you, and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit?”	342.5218457601696
“Search, then, monsieur! I am a criminal, as it appears. Estafania,	474.75024290904946
give up the keys of my drawers and my desks.”	442.4919777318462
For form’s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture	331.32252909326235
named; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that	347.878806416846
the queen would place the important letter she had written that day.	440.0938819343697
When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the	300.0161421481491
secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might	306.7125385934225
experience—it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the	464.6393374948099
affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor	423.9871926028087
advanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very	341.0083437347573
perplexed and embarrassed air, “And now it remains for me to make the	491.1684626295852
principal examination.”	450.3036351472199
“What is that?” asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was	408.2271461239751
not willing to understand.	326.99779939720105
“His majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during	472.24827077222596
the day; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This	417.15187040206945
letter is not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter	314.73423866572944
must be somewhere.”	314.50453484293854
“Would you dare to lift your hand to your queen?” said Anne of Austria,	350.1481802853588
drawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the	335.67266621352996
chancellor with an expression almost threatening.	371.2689096326897
“I am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty	309.0763609063729
commands I shall do.”	450.70468487480105
“Well, it is true!” said Anne of Austria; “and the spies of the	426.83086087218715
cardinal have served him faithfully. I have written a letter today;	362.12525333548297
that letter is not yet gone. The letter is here.” And the queen laid	426.66214736677404
her beautiful hand on her bosom.	304.89728837964765
“Then give me that letter, madame,” said the chancellor.	427.93500108081616
“I will give it to none but the king, monsieur,” said Anne.	374.7012268881465
“If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him,	423.0280472315595
madame, he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you,	395.74549473997
I am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up—”	489.84864808851313
“Well?”	329.5983146511203
“He has, then, charged me to take it from you.”	317.0465421904175
“How! What do you say?”	327.14012630780064
“That my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for	421.01479001447194
the suspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.”	450.49769607348406
“What horror!” cried the queen.	365.4934409895693
“Be kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.”	424.5622087149344
“The conduct is infamously violent! Do you know that, monsieur?”	462.8761129034759
“The king commands it, madame; excuse me.”	488.3318805021213
“I will not suffer it! No, no, I would rather die!” cried the queen, in	327.52624868846664
whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise.	337.72293943633935
The chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention	340.5791605653869
quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the	401.6188169959592
commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an	319.74584213662894
executioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached	446.183550868122
Anne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of	456.1362435126671
rage.	383.6336103791872
The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might	475.2289779770173
well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of	392.4506022592519
Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.	433.419899419178
Without doubt the chancellor Séguier looked about at that moment for	305.9362668704757
the rope of the famous bell; but not finding it he summoned his	441.4006881044904
resolution, and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the	391.2072098367506
queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found.	361.457753525827
Anne of Austria took one step backward, became so pale that it might be	412.6660639624449
said she was dying, and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind	384.0009360115474
her to keep herself from falling, she with her right hand drew the	414.6318165940244
paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals.	402.9221405515102
“There, monsieur, there is that letter!” cried the queen, with a broken	489.9536796594539
and trembling voice; “take it, and deliver me from your odious	344.7166642705518
presence.”	470.7907723405377
The chancellor, who, on his part, trembled with an emotion easily to be	325.6494295003183
conceived, took the letter, bowed to the ground, and retired. The door	316.76435418332835
was scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into	436.4947038624882
the arms of her women.	374.41808934398176
The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a	441.85557725544055
single word of it. The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for	443.73164815684765
the address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly,	295.0885115560855
then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of	305.9777536377852
Spain, he read it rapidly.	314.79721315707957
It was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal. The queen	443.2548130357019
pressed her brother and the Emperor of Austria to appear to be wounded,	379.4267847812729
as they really were, by the policy of Richelieu—the eternal object of	344.951728164197
which was the abasement of the house of Austria—to declare war against	357.9606844801979
France, and as a condition of peace, to insist upon the dismissal of	370.6812947121258
the cardinal; but as to love, there was not a single word about it in	321.7798473504044
all the letter.	375.2175806024042
The king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the	320.92941427096974
Louvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty	454.24975859923643
in the business cabinet.	431.4401281764427
The king went straight to him.	428.78088835524306
“There, Duke,” said he, “you were right and I was wrong. The whole	298.0067280322174
intrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in	431.2422921705827
this letter; but, on the other hand, there is abundant question of	368.3713378013551
you.”	372.57324928377693
The cardinal took the letter, and read it with the greatest attention;	447.3778065707509
then, when he had arrived at the end of it, he read it a second time.	462.00581180090796
“Well, your Majesty,” said he, “you see how far my enemies go; they	392.8283448368585
menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me. In your place, in	348.04801487466506
truth, sire, I should yield to such powerful instance; and on my part,	292.2058245205508
it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs.”	341.89671884087613
“What say you, Duke?”	414.9590588969693
“I say, sire, that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles	366.9111908392136
and these never-ending labors. I say that according to all probability	486.8701633701065
I shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of La	387.66963331562204
Rochelle, and that it would be far better that you should appoint there	337.5801291603834
either Monsieur de Condé, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant	411.63093526108844
gentleman whose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and	402.3446991540269
who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after	373.93462564263785
matters for which I have no aptitude. You would be the happier for it	453.94604041980324
at home, sire, and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it	359.7816754994168
abroad.”	358.2226735034452
“Monsieur Duke,” said the king, “I understand you. Be satisfied, all	308.8449955692602
who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve, even	448.83144572640276
the queen herself.”	445.14739303942065
“What do you say, sire? God forbid that the queen should suffer the	343.6031431720342
least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account! She has always	420.20654667482313
believed me, sire, to be her enemy; although your Majesty can bear	383.7917610622641
witness that I have always taken her part warmly, even against you. Oh,	462.09460735949074
if she betrayed your Majesty on the side of your honor, it would be	408.7847306773316
quite another thing, and I should be the first to say, ‘No grace,	385.19338837938756
sire—no grace for the guilty!’ Happily, there is nothing of the kind,	483.5699313517947
and your Majesty has just acquired a new proof of it.”	440.06967311421613
“That is true, Monsieur Cardinal,” said the king, “and you were right,	482.0197044351105
as you always are; but the queen, not the less, deserves all my anger.”	371.23220958996774
“It is you, sire, who have now incurred hers. And even if she were to	426.5308895516115
be seriously offended, I could well understand it; your Majesty has	361.5882538877858
treated her with a severity—”	353.5490659428872
“It is thus I will always treat my enemies and yours, Duke, however	384.23771492142953
high they may be placed, and whatever peril I may incur in acting	449.16964746806957
severely toward them.”	296.9819817449059
“The queen is my enemy, but is not yours, sire; on the contrary, she is	430.8519276927608
a devoted, submissive, and irreproachable wife. Allow me, then, sire,	293.0969590059864
to intercede for her with your Majesty.”	481.03770873115985
“Let her humble herself, then, and come to me first.”	415.1929729737872
“On the contrary, sire, set the example. You have committed the first	418.39153479710285
wrong, since it was you who suspected the queen.”	437.5025761784578
“What! I make the first advances?” said the king. “Never!”	334.5222407322398
“Sire, I entreat you to do so.”	471.67957814592205
“Besides, in what manner can I make advances first?”	455.93956590147786
“By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her.”	458.9772076070284
“What is that?”	388.00094374289324
“Give a ball; you know how much the queen loves dancing. I will answer	313.50385905760913
for it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention.”	325.75183046507107
“Monsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures.”	312.6104867476983
“The queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your	487.4444935825429
antipathy for that amusement; besides, it will be an opportunity for	418.06073344362545
her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her	405.88711714937824
birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn	491.6652693941338
herself.”	402.4213678985538
“We shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,” said the king, who, in	310.3331896140837
his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little	303.05281393286
about, and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread, was ready	309.0486318728634
to make up all differences with her, “we shall see, but upon my honor,	453.1773032552331
you are too indulgent toward her.”	460.94349632084777
“Sire,” said the cardinal, “leave severity to your ministers. Clemency	351.96732345574367
is a royal virtue; employ it, and you will find that you derive	293.04639006434326
advantage therein.”	419.43203407791634
Thereupon the cardinal, hearing the clock strike eleven, bowed low,	351.3572345525676
asking permission of the king to retire, and supplicating him to come	397.7113077514844
to a good understanding with the queen.	410.10719837481065
Anne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter,	358.12195823670015
expected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king	418.0515118315115
make some attempts at reconciliation with her. Her first movement was	474.07816574811
repellent. Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so	457.93716090336363
cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance;	369.6749141846991
but, overpersuaded by the advice of her women, she at last had the	404.2550563045431
appearance of beginning to forget. The king took advantage of this	469.43540393662903
favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly	387.89211652418135
giving a fête.	444.79101508755986
A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this	461.79288942481605
announcement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her	394.20049623404435
resentment disappeared, if not from her heart, at least from her	340.22932778361167
countenance. She asked upon what day this fête would take place, but	414.0429764617077
the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head.	436.26699093477635
Indeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should	457.5606821651961
take place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred	319.1476212315929
fixing it. Ten days passed away thus.	347.6696040351578
On the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal	386.98478041533843
received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these	395.6485128717338
lines: “I have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money.	348.89909272256136
Send me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have	437.49008086358293
received them I shall be in Paris.”	389.64291209018154
On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his	433.1532341546912
customary question to him.	328.2300612408291
Richelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, “She will	317.0365556454719
arrive, she says, four or five days after having received the money. It	465.1978988039075
will require four or five days for the transmission of the money, four	430.9725114041664
or five days for her to return; that makes ten days. Now, allowing for	357.1193109780917
contrary winds, accidents, and a woman’s weakness, there are twelve	445.44052546074704
days.”	412.99377578619135
“Well, Monsieur Duke,” said the king, “have you made your	455.48186829472957
calculations?”	322.12723518342625
“Yes, sire. Today is the twentieth of September. The aldermen of the	436.6300075595882
city give a fête on the third of October. That will fall in wonderfully	462.47254605601427
well; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the	295.23608681655753
queen.”	295.5554980874772
Then the cardinal added, “_A propos_, sire, do not forget to tell her	396.26408757724244
Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her	366.1851162679142
diamond studs become her.”	353.2086662965696
Chapter XVII.	478.9536347349213
BONACIEUX AT HOME	312.7158663564785
It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs	480.74910114398836
to the king. Louis XIII. was struck with this insistence, and began to	442.0469910184821
fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery.	463.3313585456698
More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose	330.7202728643366
police, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern	331.0178965517917
police, were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon	324.7009722141737
what was going on in his own household. He hoped, then, in a	466.74057817516007
conversation with Anne of Austria, to obtain some information from that	393.8529359357223
conversation, and afterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret	344.54738660609917
which the cardinal either knew or did not know, but which, in either	305.9777440258781
case, would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister.	380.59932640490536
He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with	345.9440587082258
fresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered	296.20180166150453
her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that	334.20893095687495
it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII. meant. Louis	358.4254854722915
XIII. wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break,	302.45740301572204
convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was	454.59411813363926
preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence	479.85240643592874
was so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his	429.55982379442565
persistence in accusation.	317.4143805090905
“But,” cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, “but, sire,	457.8162063385267
you do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done,	432.11550253640587
then? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that	446.74058302360623
your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my	304.77104812771597
brother.”	356.5437096197414
The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer;	365.5147765030762
and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which	339.6797176931626
he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête.	344.0014745762233
“Madame,” said he, with dignity, “there will shortly be a ball at the	367.8929424007824
Hôtel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you	309.47476485043524
should appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the	364.54312160377725
diamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.”	338.8742517517037
The answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII. knew	435.6760077584683
all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long	370.08104981136074
dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was	319.55851294222754
characteristic. She became excessively pale, leaned her beautiful hand	353.1268671095068
upon a _console_, which hand appeared then like one of wax, and looking	427.2044295370762
at the king with terror in her eyes, she was unable to reply by a	329.49476518758564
single syllable.	299.14432756417085
“You hear, madame,” said the king, who enjoyed the embarrassment to its	356.9383850152994
full extent, but without guessing the cause. “You hear, madame?”	342.174611527848
“Yes, sire, I hear,” stammered the queen.	382.7850197277554
“You will appear at this ball?”	469.05778875146746
“Yes.”	435.1758252818055
“With those studs?”	415.14185026979453
“Yes.”	364.46408798233904
The queen’s paleness, if possible, increased; the king perceived it,	478.55147010858343
and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides	370.18585735391673
of his character.	377.93689125057443
“Then that is agreed,” said the king, “and that is all I had to say to	314.82666768255075
you.”	428.41104117550634
“But on what day will this ball take place?” asked Anne of Austria.	454.5331563163073
Louis XIII. felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this	453.2748500979566
question, the queen having put it in an almost dying voice.	382.1219873943087
“Oh, very shortly, madame,” said he; “but I do not precisely recollect	336.5782971912354
the date of the day. I will ask the cardinal.”	319.2319485706527
“It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fête?”	486.81345163865876
“Yes, madame,” replied the astonished king; “but why do you ask that?”	414.60404265408147
“It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?”	340.3460498605386
“That is to say, madame—”	397.34119537561037
“It was he, sire, it was he!”	471.3339735487356
“Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I? Is there any	365.5662414986285
crime in this request?”	356.5191051144436
“No, sire.”	490.7694733064825
“Then you will appear?”	485.67267965389533
“Yes, sire.”	389.5121116532847
“That is well,” said the king, retiring, “that is well; I count upon	442.0874915904045
it.”	337.3699016272996
The queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees	441.94892418427065
were sinking under her. The king went away enchanted.	470.23013283037653
“I am lost,” murmured the queen, “lost!—for the cardinal knows all, and	298.9107246614153
it is he who urges on the king, who as yet knows nothing but will soon	438.196440334616
know everything. I am lost! My God, my God, my God!”	326.2105276201763
She knelt upon a cushion and prayed, with her head buried between her	400.330233783081
palpitating arms.	431.4489337097019
In fact, her position was terrible. Buckingham had returned to London;	292.53885317398795
Mme. de Chevreuse was at Tours. More closely watched than ever, the	430.72367295925403
queen felt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her	474.0168842953558
women had betrayed her. Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not	339.9863129909091
a soul in the world in whom she could confide. Thus, while	491.4422819678964
contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment	373.48807903524437
in which she was left, she broke out into sobs and tears.	478.3405045479909
“Can I be of service to your Majesty?” said all at once a voice full of	459.8322491593667
sweetness and pity.	322.7825592857054
The queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the	490.01913886337115
expression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus.	391.8382808367893
In fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queen’s apartment	350.9959457335565
appeared the pretty Mme. Bonacieux. She had been engaged in arranging	470.91994401353713
the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered; she could not	325.4788538426862
get out and had heard all.	389.9723167553722
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in	300.46660428014974
her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been	446.3502450296769
given to her by Laporte.	358.3736169943089
“Oh, fear nothing, madame!” said the young woman, clasping her hands	453.53374007692526
and weeping herself at the queen’s sorrows; “I am your Majesty’s, body	441.158127820774
and soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my	399.4824488243669
position, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your	378.82769313386007
Majesty from your trouble.”	295.2461214234528
“You, oh, heaven, you!” cried the queen; “but look me in the face. I am	409.0141465075384
betrayed on all sides. Can I trust in you?”	431.5025775377699
“Oh, madame!” cried the young woman, falling on her knees; “upon my	373.0339321329326
soul, I am ready to die for your Majesty!”	368.36843686987027
This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the	403.1057658429484
first, there was no mistaking it.	353.0908723633363
“Yes,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “yes, there are traitors here; but by	335.62463775878314
the holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to	463.62865782141324
your Majesty than I am. Those studs which the king speaks of, you gave	356.26976225784756
them to the Duke of Buckingham, did you not? Those studs were enclosed	317.80106343373853
in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm? Am I deceived? Is	486.1149093850836
it not so, madame?”	373.8458254738519
“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured the queen, whose teeth chattered with	489.96125753857194
fright.	435.7651334995439
“Well, those studs,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “we must have them back	348.66422183362556
again.”	329.4298853046115
“Yes, without doubt, it is necessary,” cried the queen; “but how am I	478.78956646732485
to act? How can it be effected?”	470.91608277591513
“Someone must be sent to the duke.”	466.4896761671234
“But who, who? In whom can I trust?”	362.11902067283313
“Place confidence in me, madame; do me that honor, my queen, and I will	449.5218978571695
find a messenger.”	489.0894380357446
“But I must write.”	456.2346193038583
“Oh, yes; that is indispensable. Two words from the hand of your	432.36296974811273
Majesty and your private seal.”	385.0267381649531
“But these two words would bring about my condemnation, divorce,	440.08365642938696
exile!”	448.34936708508155
“Yes, if they fell into infamous hands. But I will answer for these two	435.0892362591703
words being delivered to their address.”	341.99519977330385
“Oh, my God! I must then place my life, my honor, my reputation, in	350.9210402881756
your hands?”	331.25586866356684
“Yes, yes, madame, you must; and I will save them all.”	422.83457647300327
“But how? Tell me at least the means.”	319.8226225321477
“My husband had been at liberty these two or three days. I have not yet	342.48776487172245
had time to see him again. He is a worthy, honest man who entertains	429.071573459717
neither love nor hatred for anybody. He will do anything I wish. He	372.93043407743806
will set out upon receiving an order from me, without knowing what he	344.2083028853609
carries, and he will carry your Majesty’s letter, without even knowing	326.6719795973871
it is from your Majesty, to the address which is on it.”	421.1741107289462
The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of	355.45032667955775
emotion, gazed at her as if to read her very heart, and, seeing nothing	439.8723552596008
but sincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly.	445.98986503332867
“Do that,” cried she, “and you will have saved my life, you will have	330.65381305824536
saved my honor!”	320.497666196674
“Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your	460.1490021880064
Majesty. I have nothing to save for your Majesty; you are only the	484.90888574555333
victim of perfidious plots.”	421.63595114476516
“That is true, that is true, my child,” said the queen, “you are	310.48728272367026
right.”	306.3458701671715
“Give me then, that letter, madame; time presses.”	330.8885761379535
The queen ran to a little table, on which were ink, paper, and pens.	459.78920947111953
She wrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave	362.02338185567544
it to Mme. Bonacieux.	351.1727425385257
“And now,” said the queen, “we are forgetting one very necessary	411.2409928084456
thing.”	490.00339413536074
“What is that, madame?”	401.79884245213134
“Money.”	479.6867073218152
Mme. Bonacieux blushed.	340.60054688764984
“Yes, that is true,” said she, “and I will confess to your Majesty that	487.6205642216871
my husband—”	488.90894538642726
“Your husband has none. Is that what you would say?”	465.6924131126368
“He has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault.	341.92095118639406
Nevertheless, let not your Majesty be uneasy, we will find means.”	294.35125871375317
“And I have none, either,” said the queen. Those who have read the	383.3319080056576
_Memoirs_ of Mme. de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply.	300.0582946310964
“But wait a minute.”	456.82541021195016
Anne of Austria ran to her jewel case.	341.9424473830735
“Here,” said she, “here is a ring of great value, as I have been	445.76889743712695
assured. It came from my brother, the King of Spain. It is mine, and I	326.5106585564707
am at liberty to dispose of it. Take this ring; raise money with it,	337.61383006175714
and let your husband set out.”	296.87028643783515
“In an hour you shall be obeyed.”	424.42578285239523
“You see the address,” said the queen, speaking so low that Mme.	399.31965780565304
Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said, “To my Lord Duke of	411.3266893523479
Buckingham, London.”	384.66882160134037
“The letter shall be given to himself.”	423.76174586493755
“Generous girl!” cried Anne of Austria.	465.8313847208175
Mme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in	296.4280730977989
the bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird.	419.39646679887136
Ten minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had	394.5851497225342
not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the	414.57032071831543
change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal—a	420.2401154087114
change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from	293.0463441377376
the Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux,	373.78839897924735
and had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable	468.3120280104363
sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only	436.25370168657923
a political precaution.	477.24938981840165
She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with	487.76835955656094
difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the	310.78818362451983
furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied—justice not being one	321.1698698545692
of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of	419.91817854049054
their passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her	488.56240837077394
master’s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that	431.86070866774196
she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her	490.2050079417436
native place.	486.15450592643896
The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed	307.1220880405798
his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by	369.18544037658194
congratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could	408.28783481840134
steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit.	358.87083953640774
This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other	442.8153592382422
circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he	343.2796809082528
had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits	299.37613229926876
Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody	328.5646305282313
knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.	378.55395181744933
This was the more so because Bonacieux’s reflections were all	342.9055268240254
rose-colored. Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and	294.06218690247897
never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him.	425.524688527184
The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	295.5818056951221
fortune.	405.5924470138648
On her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be	460.5596756369421
admitted, upon something widely different from ambition. In spite of	312.04991729834524
herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who	388.9328778504676
was so brave and appeared to be so much in love. Married at eighteen to	410.91751459094866
M. Bonacieux, having always lived among her husband’s friends—people	300.85372191228043
little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman	319.7781607333898
whose heart was above her position—Mme. Bonacieux had remained	414.6597700997606
insensible to vulgar seductions; but at this period the title of	330.94163033914003
gentleman had great influence with the citizen class, and D’Artagnan	478.1687623581099
was a gentleman. Besides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which,	386.4024149990129
next to that of the Musketeers, was most admired by the ladies. He was,	462.8472361123736
we repeat, handsome, young, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who	475.0273414618858
did love and was anxious to be loved in return. There was certainly	356.6386544319894
enough in all this to turn a head only twenty-three years old, and Mme.	337.47098749239433
Bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life.	296.8248397400784
The couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days,	469.1076021541371
and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were	319.5855964674799
concerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation.	381.32133808831964
Nevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his	316.6429448453747
wife with open arms. Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him.	392.6172387164943
“Let us talk a little,” said she.	305.3844494897805
“How!” said Bonacieux, astonished.	383.82688845715154
“Yes, I have something of the highest importance to tell you.”	366.3827421895804
“True,” said he, “and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put	321.0015893086954
to you. Describe to me your abduction, I pray you.”	417.82315377626605
“Oh, that’s of no consequence just now,” said Mme. Bonacieux.	339.46545233416833
“And what does it concern, then—my captivity?”	385.5317085860081
“I heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any	328.9093106144858
crime, as you were not guilty of any intrigue, as you, in short, knew	487.41671559591384
nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else, I attached no	401.7382897215542
more importance to that event than it merited.”	434.44502471731744
“You speak very much at your ease, madame,” said Bonacieux, hurt at the	460.2387537779174
little interest his wife showed in him. “Do you know that I was plunged	484.6405953176078
during a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille?”	422.31821519181824
“Oh, a day and night soon pass away. Let us return to the object that	392.58660803420787
brings me here.”	477.53712047564966
“What, that which brings you home to me? Is it not the desire of seeing	313.79367143714364
a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week?” asked	463.09975229161705
the mercer, piqued to the quick.	311.06923588374747
“Yes, that first, and other things afterward.”	350.8004731962186
“Speak.”	331.7368886448466
“It is a thing of the highest interest, and upon which our future	408.3983688781872
fortune perhaps depends.”	482.1567741806888
“The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you,	395.3303637634681
Madame Bonacieux, and I should not be astonished if in the course of a	420.1379331017701
few months it were to excite the envy of many folks.”	398.5321091881434
“Yes, particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give	449.6836594481422
you.”	430.96763605460717
“Me?”	388.4495993254575
“Yes, you. There is good and holy action to be performed, monsieur, and	356.06316434655133
much money to be gained at the same time.”	339.8474213198142
Mme. Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband, she took	404.85751611322985
him on his weak side. But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had	333.3973249310071
talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same	454.31694711659975
man.	359.0275120521036
“Much money to be gained?” said Bonacieux, protruding his lip.	486.4079594109875
“Yes, much.”	312.1894678604374
“About how much?”	342.22480638549695
“A thousand pistoles, perhaps.”	294.94523305829193
“What you demand of me is serious, then?”	454.51556787869936
“It is indeed.”	297.03763131742545
“What must be done?”	319.1359628382195
“You must go away immediately. I will give you a paper which you must	379.8053213409986
not part with on any account, and which you will deliver into the	481.12046685158236
proper hands.”	378.1617651259702
“And whither am I to go?”	419.1408616555344
“To London.”	362.7796342918417
“I go to London? Go to! You jest! I have no business in London.”	428.21641355339807
“But others wish that you should go there.”	481.02043083653416
“But who are those others? I warn you that I will never again work in	473.8973221021236
the dark, and that I will know not only to what I expose myself, but	373.6920465994957
for whom I expose myself.”	316.2518314728129
“An illustrious person sends you; an illustrious person awaits you. The	457.1958761579001
recompense will exceed your expectations; that is all I promise you.”	387.3755566118457
“More intrigues! Nothing but intrigues! Thank you, madame, I am aware	335.89080963350773
of them now; Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that head.”	346.1435782995352
“The cardinal?” cried Mme. Bonacieux. “Have you seen the cardinal?”	388.05211533973807
“He sent for me,” answered the mercer, proudly.	395.27868011662747
“And you responded to his bidding, you imprudent man?”	295.3452092764941
“Well, I can’t say I had much choice of going or not going, for I was	417.0934214559932
taken to him between two guards. It is true also, that as I did not	404.35860278864885
then know his Eminence, if I had been able to dispense with the visit,	430.11546449294116
I should have been enchanted.”	339.85670733789243
“He ill-treated you, then; he threatened you?”	484.80989374092337
“He gave me his hand, and called me his friend. His friend! Do you hear	383.3450788251798
that, madame? I am the friend of the great cardinal!”	480.92646172850766
“Of the great cardinal!”	399.7376266917796
“Perhaps you would contest his right to that title, madame?”	355.4556670360873
“I would contest nothing; but I tell you that the favor of a minister	335.5472606528295
is ephemeral, and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a	411.28933685390047
minister. There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or	338.4391486058781
the issue of an event; it is to these powers we should rally.”	432.5940089223708
“I am sorry for it, madame, but I acknowledge no other power but that	451.25960070704866
of the great man whom I have the honor to serve.”	484.73929679391495
“You serve the cardinal?”	379.38975035771693
“Yes, madame; and as his servant, I will not allow you to be concerned	299.32608141612303
in plots against the safety of the state, or to serve the intrigues of	481.9642663834758
a woman who is not French and who has a Spanish heart. Fortunately we	331.76400952446016
have the great cardinal; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates	449.09042625199515
to the bottom of the heart.”	464.42825066958426
Bonacieux was repeating, word for word, a sentence which he had heard	455.4354735014582
from the Comte de Rochefort; but the poor wife, who had reckoned on her	482.4718583124478
husband, and who, in that hope, had answered for him to the queen, did	309.04106540447066
not tremble the less, both at the danger into which she had nearly cast	360.1937827995392
herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced.	323.78418194574897
Nevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more	371.0586635077767
particularly his cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to	348.5307808295445
her purpose.	433.26511537526073
“Ah, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?” cried she; “and	327.3077641413152
you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your	391.55397861695127
queen?”	370.2788137713911
“Private interests are as nothing before the interests of all. I am for	459.6273365212759
those who save the state,” said Bonacieux, emphatically.	350.51332400655986
“And what do you know about the state you talk of?” said Mme.	390.9298422733
Bonacieux, shrugging her shoulders. “Be satisfied with being a plain,	444.77998404348955
straightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most	478.61109155180145
advantages.”	312.50830260024685
“Eh, eh!” said Bonacieux, slapping a plump, round bag, which returned	396.41077596059057
of sound a money; “what do you think of this, Madame Preacher?”	413.3089883787303
“Whence comes that money?”	406.7682018868369
“You do not guess?”	359.70428957473825
“From the cardinal?”	372.99487287149304
“From him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.”	297.5956824069012
“The Comte de Rochefort! Why, it was he who carried me off!”	446.0276807121194
“That may be, madame!”	452.39432486034
“And you receive silver from that man?”	429.26954866812565
“Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?”	346.6492965899939
“Yes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my	449.26945262101583
mistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise	326.4682606999579
the honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.”	431.9443636021464
“Madame,” replied Bonacieux, “your august mistress is a perfidious	329.02053070456407
Spaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.”	386.1017680058533
“Monsieur,” said the young woman, “I know you to be cowardly,	437.2009278042981
avaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!”	349.65766094918865
“Madame,” said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and	449.0324797814717
who recoiled before this conjugal anger, “madame, what do you say?”	388.1949870214064
“I say you are a miserable creature!” continued Mme. Bonacieux, who saw	421.42981296927917
she was regaining some little influence over her husband. “You meddle	442.77498037942325
with politics, do you—and still more, with cardinalist politics? Why,	472.0655454113638
you sell yourself, body and soul, to the demon, the devil, for money!”	448.7857316731242
“No, to the cardinal.”	408.7469620670464
“It’s the same thing,” cried the young woman. “Who calls Richelieu	361.6348265589296
calls Satan.”	444.54870272837684
“Hold your tongue, hold your tongue, madame! You may be overheard.”	329.61790683238627
“Yes, you are right; I should be ashamed for anyone to know your	441.67566032575155
baseness.”	467.67963689558064
“But what do you require of me, then? Let us see.”	463.6251252147489
“I have told you. You must depart instantly, monsieur. You must	437.4786531934203
accomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you, and	452.88149680964347
on that condition I pardon everything, I forget everything; and what is	300.41678648002346
more,” and she held out her hand to him, “I restore my love.”	301.49799416251483
Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious, but he loved his wife. He was	365.8451742291001
softened. A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of	358.7328327021076
twenty-three. Mme. Bonacieux saw that he hesitated.	297.27516001955615
“Come! Have you decided?” said she.	399.42614417672564
“But, my dear love, reflect a little upon what you require of me.	309.16402592143
London is far from Paris, very far, and perhaps the commission with	300.3750398106403
which you charge me is not without dangers?”	320.08638268217317
“What matters it, if you avoid them?”	447.35001405890364
“Hold, Madame Bonacieux,” said the mercer, “hold! I positively refuse;	300.1702781846866
intrigues terrify me. I have seen the Bastille. My! Whew! That’s a	308.1711098183054
frightful place, that Bastille! Only to think of it makes my flesh	402.251719509044
crawl. They threatened me with torture. Do you know what torture is?	369.4281079257993
Wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones	413.78536302973794
stick out! No, positively I will not go. And, _morbleu_, why do you not	344.7900152765019
go yourself? For in truth, I think I have hitherto been deceived in	447.5765724679256
you. I really believe you are a man, and a violent one, too.”	451.44808210167866
“And you, you are a woman—a miserable woman, stupid and brutal. You are	419.8653853646849
afraid, are you? Well, if you do not go this very instant, I will have	398.2127164236276
you arrested by the queen’s orders, and I will have you placed in the	315.26981029858774
Bastille which you dread so much.”	368.6032679981047
Bonacieux fell into a profound reflection. He weighed the two angers in	355.58552944202904
his brain—that of the cardinal and that of the queen; that of the	394.4817435743746
cardinal predominated enormously.	393.08078552806455
“Have me arrested on the part of the queen,” said he, “and I—I will	339.15484788321356
appeal to his Eminence.”	293.73914021952424
At once Mme. Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far, and she was	371.9370079622689
terrified at having communicated so much. She for a moment contemplated	462.61495011435863
with fright that stupid countenance, impressed with the invincible	382.9369791991111
resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear.	312.4859358601515
“Well, be it so!” said she. “Perhaps, when all is considered, you are	423.0721219394386
right. In the long run, a man knows more about politics than a woman,	394.3684144976761
particularly such as, like you, Monsieur Bonacieux, have conversed with	488.36658275994904
the cardinal. And yet it is very hard,” added she, “that a man upon	452.17501040920956
whose affection I thought I might depend, treats me thus unkindly and	446.0092018189098
will not comply with any of my fancies.”	374.01186122530436
“That is because your fancies go too far,” replied the triumphant	460.80984714414114
Bonacieux, “and I mistrust them.”	320.8383161070229
“Well, I will give it up, then,” said the young woman, sighing. “It is	298.87360834032233
well as it is; say no more about it.”	451.3349029381544
“At least you should tell me what I should have to do in London,”	401.46888442184525
replied Bonacieux, who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had	406.36470054903225
desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife’s secrets.	364.4735503722274
“It is of no use for you to know anything about it,” said the young	404.94353565264015
woman, whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back. “It was	424.83868117313665
about one of those purchases that interest women—a purchase by which	421.97912283469896
much might have been gained.”	474.7527341610657
But the more the young woman excused herself, the more important	429.9008372874699
Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him. He	484.377689710177
resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de	416.3460644578166
Rochefort, and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to	452.7097142278609
send to London.	491.8141584002533
“Pardon me for quitting you, my dear Madame Bonacieux,” said he; “but,	394.63959999432996
not knowing you would come to see me, I had made an engagement with a	400.8489532851987
friend. I shall soon return; and if you will wait only a few minutes	406.66274584061114
for me, as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend, as it	361.8879709763575
is growing late, I will come back and reconduct you to the Louvre.”	396.46226391081143
“Thank you, monsieur, you are not brave enough to be of any use to me	302.7125618688734
whatever,” replied Mme. Bonacieux. “I shall return very safely to the	397.82242330356667
Louvre all alone.”	404.6891162873668
“As you please, Madame Bonacieux,” said the ex-mercer. “Shall I see you	427.66978022634294
again soon?”	295.6888453223473
“Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty, and I will	487.5756863146089
take advantage of it to come and put things in order here, as they must	350.10880745710796
necessarily be much deranged.”	357.1898002332458
“Very well; I shall expect you. You are not angry with me?”	408.50631906195713
“Not the least in the world.”	343.4316332917639
“Till then, then?”	387.15023433036384
“Till then.”	413.63122221320475
Bonacieux kissed his wife’s hand, and set off at a quick pace.	366.8397644128785
“Well,” said Mme. Bonacieux, when her husband had shut the street door	402.850527430576
and she found herself alone; “that imbecile lacked but one thing: to	418.6272352781999
become a cardinalist. And I, who have answered for him to the queen—I,	347.327832871277
who have promised my poor mistress—ah, my God, my God! She will take me	339.9400183688818
for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are	302.7075176302765
placed about her as spies! Ah, Monsieur Bonacieux, I never did love you	372.9469444270713
much, but now it is worse than ever. I hate you, and on my word you	429.12385119352837
shall pay for this!”	384.68086788945214
At the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise	371.5524568126963
her head, and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried,	355.7197987069746
“Dear Madame Bonacieux, open for me the little door on the alley, and I	448.10527770464364
will come down to you.”	427.8576619725742
Chapter XVIII.	430.4469139080314
LOVER AND HUSBAND	332.48761761799784
Ah, Madame,” said D’Artagnan, entering by the door which the young	491.54150969756415
woman opened for him, “allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of	374.5751455455367
a husband.”	485.7281160217814
“You have, then, overheard our conversation?” asked Mme. Bonacieux,	386.1403831463283
eagerly, and looking at D’Artagnan with disquiet.	478.3282014440566
“The whole.”	302.38530131246915
“But how, my God?”	307.6696259667349
“By a mode of proceeding known to myself, and by which I likewise	473.84468327300254
overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the	479.29519180191875
cardinal’s police.”	330.09365972388093
“And what did you understand by what we said?”	334.0776391104145
“A thousand things. In the first place, that, unfortunately, your	460.1906948585119
husband is a simpleton and a fool; in the next place, you are in	431.59466928392135
trouble, of which I am very glad, as it gives me an opportunity of	311.3787187310354
placing myself at your service, and God knows I am ready to throw	302.1501861508116
myself into the fire for you; finally, that the queen wants a brave,	420.27394718523567
intelligent, devoted man to make a journey to London for her. I have at	407.369817574798
least two of the three qualities you stand in need of, and here I am.”	324.54334611889277
Mme. Bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret	421.7433668697961
hope shone in her eyes.	314.34949958318344
“And what guarantee will you give me,” asked she, “if I consent to	299.2300237131773
confide this message to you?”	402.71671739732216
“My love for you. Speak! Command! What is to be done?”	424.7612444685707
“My God, my God!” murmured the young woman, “ought I to confide such a	359.9853975954905
secret to you, monsieur? You are almost a boy.”	413.12134897490944
“I see that you require someone to answer for me?”	485.34307726125473
“I admit that would reassure me greatly.”	324.2585260821545
“Do you know Athos?”	310.18826136158845
“No.”	405.36452552843826
“Porthos?”	460.202640632825
“No.”	349.18858332307144
“Aramis?”	317.23883452301493
“No. Who are these gentleman?”	482.2234708413698
“Three of the king’s Musketeers. Do you know Monsieur de Tréville,	304.6070655535161
their captain?”	477.1913814762023
“Oh, yes, him! I know him; not personally, but from having heard the	401.8184797369304
queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman.”	330.44605899519706
“You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?”	403.7347288656004
“Oh, no, certainly not!”	340.4943933885209
“Well, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however	436.96644274377303
important, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not	435.6992143092242
confide it to me.”	320.3064376282679
“But this secret is not mine, and I cannot reveal it in this manner.”	474.435975386129
“You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan,	308.535256198949
with chagrin.	429.8755677042798
“As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree, to the wing of a	449.0183723280543
pigeon, to the collar of a dog.”	452.1912985614126
“And yet, me—you see plainly that I love you.”	351.34438444359336
“You say so.”	365.5831328330495
“I am an honorable man.”	403.0336315068474
“You say so.”	344.7219631816766
“I am a gallant fellow.”	401.20627130480773
“I believe it.”	387.4934838279968
“I am brave.”	423.8354377810175
“Oh, I am sure of that!”	319.2510476978668
“Then, put me to the proof.”	445.6812304400543
Mme. Bonacieux looked at the young man, restrained for a minute by a	322.15146895495
last hesitation; but there was such an ardor in his eyes, such	474.74999110057104
persuasion in his voice, that she felt herself constrained to confide	452.8501396980765
in him. Besides, she found herself in circumstances where everything	438.27441098550605
must be risked for the sake of everything. The queen might be as much	385.8112237994538
injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence; and—let us	353.58608956719996
admit it—the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young	420.81351180915954
protector decided her to speak.	312.6662283806777
“Listen,” said she; “I yield to your protestations, I yield to your	380.7169172229902
assurances. But I swear to you, before God who hears us, that if you	373.59797831780645
betray me, and my enemies pardon me, I will kill myself, while accusing	293.34845901984664
you of my death.”	292.3297996507746
“And I—I swear to you before God, madame,” said D’Artagnan, “that if I	316.0128455259363
am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me, I will die sooner	486.63689261816404
than do anything that may compromise anyone.”	439.84108172057955
Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which	322.96746481758436
chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the	299.7782706560885
Samaritaine. This was their mutual declaration of love.	450.25167731778504
D’Artagnan was radiant with joy and pride. This secret which he	450.9911397324407
possessed, this woman whom he loved! Confidence and love made him a	489.0165073114368
giant.	481.7685884410749
“I go,” said he; “I go at once.”	461.78243890483077
“How, you will go!” said Mme. Bonacieux; “and your regiment, your	363.6101354228731
captain?”	444.70591536875037
“By my soul, you had made me forget all that, dear Constance! Yes, you	296.9124667486784
are right; a furlough is needful.”	422.24519308957167
“Still another obstacle,” murmured Mme. Bonacieux, sorrowfully.	445.3641590935256
“As to that,” cried D’Artagnan, after a moment of reflection, “I shall	357.5004189876553
surmount it, be assured.”	390.0979031442131
“How so?”	352.6909312694869
“I will go this very evening to Tréville, whom I will request to ask	391.7429749204819
this favor for me of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart.”	433.12048165098946
“But another thing.”	444.3910268249387
“What?” asked D’Artagnan, seeing that Mme. Bonacieux hesitated to	464.4509929452238
continue.	321.7155429382937
“You have, perhaps, no money?”	395.83154329934183
“_Perhaps_ is too much,” said D’Artagnan, smiling.	365.99317386846906
“Then,” replied Mme. Bonacieux, opening a cupboard and taking from it	401.0102951162116
the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so	399.30974241722345
affectionately, “take this bag.”	340.3399235422896
“The cardinal’s?” cried D’Artagnan, breaking into a loud laugh, he	383.6917092721734
having heard, as may be remembered, thanks to the broken boards, every	416.0949588673297
syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife.	323.46612880378655
“The cardinal’s,” replied Mme. Bonacieux. “You see it makes a very	422.5029213050319
respectable appearance.”	377.6402387591852
“_Pardieu_,” cried D’Artagnan, “it will be a double amusing affair to	462.34652307327826
save the queen with the cardinal’s money!”	474.86282808439967
“You are an amiable and charming young man,” said Mme. Bonacieux. “Be	414.555275797294
assured you will not find her Majesty ungrateful.”	452.12759917172093
“Oh, I am already grandly recompensed!” cried D’Artagnan. “I love you;	466.97806288257175
you permit me to tell you that I do—that is already more happiness than	297.5348300388768
I dared to hope.”	307.3726467567802
“Silence!” said Mme. Bonacieux, starting.	348.2593574764094
“What!”	383.67759618539435
“Someone is talking in the street.”	347.508179772549
“It is the voice of—”	306.7945368349325
“Of my husband! Yes, I recognize it!”	447.3006966957952
D’Artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt.	471.47863019383493
“He shall not come in before I am gone,” said he; “and when I am gone,	376.6283249835382
you can open to him.”	322.0564900093149
“But I ought to be gone, too. And the disappearance of his money; how	385.4217802718508
am I to justify it if I am here?”	396.2991203593839
“You are right; we must go out.”	327.38534198032846
“Go out? How? He will see us if we go out.”	396.88111428540304
“Then you must come up into my room.”	308.17429874744045
“Ah,” said Mme. Bonacieux, “you speak that in a tone that frightens	468.54287475355284
me!”	382.38043868147486
Mme. Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes.	377.80501404799384
D’Artagnan saw those tears, and much disturbed, softened, he threw	386.87574215085954
himself at her feet.	308.47426651400514
“With me you will be as safe as in a temple; I give you my word of a	431.08395786569713
gentleman.”	461.7488287199568
“Let us go,” said she, “I place full confidence in you, my friend!”	387.29687623120816
D’Artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution, and both, light as	379.6282318457719
shadows, glided through the interior door into the passage, ascended	321.87608778037827
the stairs as quietly as possible, and entered D’Artagnan’s chambers.	322.26635263541897
Once there, for greater security, the young man barricaded the door.	404.4161171836522
They both approached the window, and through a slit in the shutter they	371.8940748081642
saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak.	433.39743552490177
At sight of this man, D’Artagnan started, and half drawing his sword,	420.7419406559888
sprang toward the door.	399.1891191572481
It was the man of Meung.	399.9302073555366
“What are you going to do?” cried Mme. Bonacieux; “you will ruin us	344.9861958512398
all!”	471.374130417606
“But I have sworn to kill that man!” said D’Artagnan.	441.28569273609685
“Your life is devoted from this moment, and does not belong to you. In	356.0256200697564
the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril	431.27317162327626
which is foreign to that of your journey.”	330.59726481655724
“And do you command nothing in your own name?”	379.236364732886
“In my name,” said Mme. Bonacieux, with great emotion, “in my name I	422.3568822240413
beg you! But listen; they appear to be speaking of me.”	358.6396462421597
D’Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear.	445.25459096694385
M. Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had	388.9289119778942
returned to the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an	362.69009288931306
instant.	356.54921192578684
“She is gone,” said he; “she must have returned to the Louvre.”	393.3482888622051
“You are sure,” replied the stranger, “that she did not suspect the	397.93937210724454
intentions with which you went out?”	381.2371013251044
“No,” replied Bonacieux, with a self-sufficient air, “she is too	306.6122473105019
superficial a woman.”	362.82555313493424
“Is the young Guardsman at home?”	443.0788327805103
“I do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can	467.36905268174604
see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters.”	434.862453883704
“All the same, it is well to be certain.”	348.823393840629
“How so?”	386.72168611397103
“By knocking at his door. Go.”	351.17737206363955
“I will ask his servant.”	324.11570412663986
Bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had	318.1689205989286
afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to D’Artagnan’s door,	320.8051132088113
and knocked.	309.76796096143715
No one answered. Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that	443.5989392878669
evening borrowed Planchet. As to D’Artagnan, he took care not to give	376.5773283431042
the least sign of existence.	399.5204770593358
The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young	378.953223467442
people felt their hearts bound within them.	352.4765757508089
“There is nobody within,” said Bonacieux.	299.2810695398464
“Never mind. Let us return to your apartment. We shall be safer there	466.25679503008973
than in the doorway.”	432.623885805622
“Ah, my God!” whispered Mme. Bonacieux, “we shall hear no more.”	448.1754929267793
“On the contrary,” said D’Artagnan, “we shall hear better.”	372.7620299788195
D’Artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber	366.3456259843295
another ear of Dionysius, spread a carpet on the floor, went upon his	386.5046421266452
knees, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the	471.05118087461847
opening.	444.08787315670133
“You are sure there is nobody there?” said the stranger.	469.50167424546476
“I will answer for it,” said Bonacieux.	416.6267039642135
“And you think that your wife—”	467.55170333271826
“Has returned to the Louvre.”	442.8899480432126
“Without speaking to anyone but yourself?”	378.770116458368
“I am sure of it.”	399.69034956305876
“That is an important point, do you understand?”	397.977868936161
“Then the news I brought you is of value?”	470.5302793723225
“The greatest, my dear Bonacieux; I don’t conceal this from you.”	457.1182824383111
“Then the cardinal will be pleased with me?”	299.4382322986082
“I have no doubt of it.”	334.1052181353298
“The great cardinal!”	430.5401997096095
“Are you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned	407.9581518945346
no names?”	400.29576418930384
“I think not.”	370.66476437526774
“She did not name Madame de Chevreuse, the Duke of Buckingham, or	328.2350467380624
Madame de Vernet?”	381.1045615783408
“No; she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the	378.5895694118311
interests of an illustrious personage.”	458.51522753714653
“The traitor!” murmured Mme. Bonacieux.	354.17131499049884
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, taking her hand, which, without thinking of	456.92636103832945
it, she abandoned to him.	422.77655179655596
“Never mind,” continued the man in the cloak; “you were a fool not to	438.42360758932136
have pretended to accept the mission. You would then be in present	439.6181621715196
possession of the letter. The state, which is now threatened, would be	439.7613166478466
safe, and you—”	408.8076746417786
“And I?”	362.1337041480623
“Well you—the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility.”	442.5463271561616
“Did he tell you so?”	334.53708525523905
“Yes, I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise.”	471.07875709793143
“Be satisfied,” replied Bonacieux; “my wife adores me, and there is yet	293.3838260417141
time.”	304.6204212141897
“The ninny!” murmured Mme. Bonacieux.	352.8415022781528
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, pressing her hand more closely.	353.51215606831266
“How is there still time?” asked the man in the cloak.	384.0224756167535
“I go to the Louvre; I ask for Mme. Bonacieux; I say that I have	457.45668394601466
reflected; I renew the affair; I obtain the letter, and I run directly	377.7891589139196
to the cardinal.”	454.9083106736331
“Well, go quickly! I will return soon to learn the result of your	453.50502271909494
trip.”	432.84315301726656
The stranger went out.	459.49367988306903
“Infamous!” said Mme. Bonacieux, addressing this epithet to her	327.56333608745047
husband.	431.1007186182318
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, pressing her hand still more warmly.	464.5518418651734
A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of D’Artagnan and Mme.	433.4225290951124
Bonacieux. It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of	430.48094769799343
the moneybag, and was crying “Thieves!”	335.78397503273294
“Oh, my God!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “he will rouse the whole quarter.”	463.68305693358116
Bonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their	328.8482574613693
frequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the	347.2110644891207
mercer’s house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out	303.8287811563631
continuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he	423.7419734685561
went in the direction of the Rue du Bac.	483.1610785856332
“Now he is gone, it is your turn to get out,” said Mme. Bonacieux.	415.49636628422536
“Courage, my friend, but above all, prudence, and think what you owe to	306.42431618225044
the queen.”	454.32054338535517
“To her and to you!” cried D’Artagnan. “Be satisfied, beautiful	382.50013862372873
Constance. I shall become worthy of her gratitude; but shall I likewise	421.6139252741863
return worthy of your love?”	474.8427181345545
The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	418.5001980431837
cheeks. A few seconds afterward D’Artagnan also went out enveloped in a	301.8414183320081
large cloak, which ill-concealed the sheath of a long sword.	457.0426866388324
Mme. Bonacieux followed him with her eyes, with that long, fond look	439.622107073678
with which he had turned the angle of the street, she fell on her	420.7375757624046
knees, and clasping her hands, “Oh, my God,” cried she, “protect the	366.4183954236337
queen, protect me!”	488.2888200667509
Chapter XIX.	348.66371701179247
PLAN OF CAMPAIGN	443.008278461263
D’Artagnan went straight to M. de Tréville’s. He had reflected that in	413.47938009812214
a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger, who	431.4785592109565
appeared to be his agent, and he judged, with reason, he had not a	407.6244422578605
moment to lose.	386.4128540290063
The heart of the young man overflowed with joy. An opportunity	369.0064303286963
presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory	445.4613538497849
to be acquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher	311.84923798257176
encouragement, it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he	302.8619933499025
adored. This chance did, then, for him at once more than he would have	427.3816116200771
dared to ask of Providence.	329.71937637309
M. de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen.	340.8569383768241
D’Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to	421.0479748099409
his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of	318.1284753450454
importance.	302.8259749435498
D’Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Tréville	464.2109671554765
entered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his	490.33203260003506
countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new	349.16642175220755
was on foot.	302.8399796848471
All the way along D’Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether	463.92525012267856
he should place confidence in M. de Tréville, or whether he should only	385.53602059517016
ask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret affair. But M. de	459.27264421737596
Tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so	424.17883880027404
devoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially,	380.4316593126699
that the young man resolved to tell him everything.	366.8734667535998
“Did you ask for me, my good friend?” said M. de Tréville.	421.9266504634937
“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, lowering his voice, “and you will	378.5631922381848
pardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the	394.6744561360017
importance of my business.”	474.32528498847876
“Speak, then, I am all attention.”	302.0928326562127
“It concerns nothing less,” said D’Artagnan, “than the honor, perhaps	357.1918168230986
the life of the queen.”	454.92891126022766
“What did you say?” asked M. de Tréville, glancing round to see if they	363.46809226287763
were surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon	393.2756405818119
D’Artagnan.	379.24294261984994
“I say, monsieur, that chance has rendered me master of a secret—”	341.86713972736845
“Which you will guard, I hope, young man, as your life.”	433.54404453054127
“But which I must impart to you, monsieur, for you alone can assist me	392.5524491304518
in the mission I have just received from her Majesty.”	447.04032997091144
“Is this secret your own?”	390.35931335711734
“No, monsieur; it is her Majesty’s.”	464.74918985460374
“Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me?”	305.57795628088667
“No, monsieur, for, on the contrary, I am desired to preserve the	485.42682684846466
profoundest mystery.”	398.54729511675686
“Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?”	414.9542490055794
“Because, as I said, without you I can do nothing; and I am afraid you	318.7188585427462
will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I	355.31304774264714
ask it.”	347.12060363461774
“Keep your secret, young man, and tell me what you wish.”	433.6562889445272
“I wish you to obtain for me, from Monsieur Dessessart, leave of	403.6824113834012
absence for fifteen days.”	419.0381441563248
“When?”	317.79728031931484
“This very night.”	483.247125638214
“You leave Paris?”	328.84992700312057
“I am going on a mission.”	352.9338064069236
“May you tell me whither?”	344.11226077054033
“To London.”	410.2399713619393
“Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?”	363.80771023783444
“The cardinal, I believe, would give the world to prevent my success.”	395.73014048884227
“And you are going alone?”	437.21720093290475
“I am going alone.”	448.05109313857014
“In that case you will not get beyond Bondy. I tell you so, by the	313.5523756475428
faith of de Tréville.”	414.70684674249014
“How so?”	489.55640489078587
“You will be assassinated.”	404.32494600122993
“And I shall die in the performance of my duty.”	394.86225703482603
“But your mission will not be accomplished.”	415.6496074122491
“That is true,” replied D’Artagnan.	353.2757811168578
“Believe me,” continued Tréville, “in enterprises of this kind, in	336.5611685737652
order that one may arrive, four must set out.”	334.52698309209205
“Ah, you are right, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “but you know Athos,	478.95679532449697
Porthos, and Aramis, and you know if I can dispose of them.”	463.78707363279034
“Without confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know?”	364.2481751324244
“We are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness	474.6007254921932
against all proof. Besides, you can tell them that you have full	350.58378844041215
confidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you.”	356.6843036235921
“I can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is	442.7872150606041
all—to Athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters	311.79836246609176
of Forges; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend, whom they	475.96369973931155
are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition. Sending their	342.17712717234684
leave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their journey.”	332.1533718717552
“Thanks, monsieur. You are a hundred times too good.”	365.94405876988463
“Begone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight! Ha!	415.8460837088689
But first write your request to Dessessart. Perhaps you had a spy at	472.78762716864424
your heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal,	488.55997878456344
will thus seem legitimate.”	335.3955929544378
D’Artagnan drew up his request, and M. de Tréville, on receiving it,	324.92563771024174
assured him that by two o’clock in the morning the four leaves of	384.1470534674268
absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers.	418.45968899861634
“Have the goodness to send mine to Athos’s residence. I should dread	378.9114903083276
some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.”	486.05147440338925
“Be easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. _A propos_,” said M. de	472.5652423780092
Tréville, calling him back.	325.8174977597595
D’Artagnan returned.	435.7224453472926
“Have you any money?”	350.7321109635799
D’Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.	456.44418028376526
“Enough?” asked M. de Tréville.	329.0049517773272
“Three hundred pistoles.”	318.7811059078453
“Oh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone,	435.9934749439186
then!”	406.9603197460483
D’Artagnan saluted M. de Tréville, who held out his hand to him;	446.1861253280324
D’Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his	336.1114030820066
first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this	461.1554248343035
excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great.	484.2982410538565
His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since	365.8424722277315
the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still	361.942982957342
further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had	401.91408026508526
seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.	467.32951365676746
This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.	384.37450524771214
D’Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis	371.227033970348
pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St.	355.07954643304276
Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following	391.1011298430825
week, and which preoccupied him a good deal.	300.705771264381
After the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from	467.41025059206424
M. de Tréville entered, bringing a sealed packet.	358.91437446848664
“What is that?” asked Aramis.	468.57192457254826
“The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for,” replied the lackey.	462.8266845503944
“For me! I have asked for no leave of absence.”	470.8335070648385
“Hold your tongue and take it!” said D’Artagnan. “And you, my friend,	437.3643374180708
there is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell Monsieur de	327.8919961045768
Tréville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to him. Go.”	295.874507679928
The lackey bowed to the ground and departed.	323.9468838657334
“What does all this mean?” asked Aramis.	292.6672477396414
“Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me.”	403.2411109122726
“But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing—”	394.65757593665154
Aramis stopped.	491.99287175135464
“What is become of her? I suppose you mean—” continued D’Artagnan.	406.8983815296872
“Become of whom?” replied Aramis.	368.45306926627956
“The woman who was here—the woman with the embroidered handkerchief.”	385.27592262281075
“Who told you there was a woman here?” replied Aramis, becoming as pale	434.2738893978143
as death.	452.9399799778547
“I saw her.”	440.4537600518563
“And you know who she is?”	487.14763495403406
“I believe I can guess, at least.”	469.98539595203243
“Listen!” said Aramis. “Since you appear to know so many things, can	460.23528401934783
you tell me what is become of that woman?”	335.56714375804125
“I presume that she has returned to Tours.”	448.6580512567034
“To Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she	354.7903939803614
return to Tours without telling me anything?”	432.09408250371547
“Because she was in fear of being arrested.”	413.6080805289362
“Why has she not written to me, then?”	434.9191559193845
“Because she was afraid of compromising you.”	340.12958934558515
“D’Artagnan, you restore me to life!” cried Aramis. “I fancied myself	399.09910092985496
despised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not	303.16224144448853
have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other	452.32720276897766
cause could she have returned to Paris?”	471.85908028802896
“For the cause which today takes us to England.”	490.2924985967809
“And what is this cause?” demanded Aramis.	482.05175059514295
“Oh, you’ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the	304.9462870774997
discretion of ‘the doctor’s niece.’”	453.00893992688765
Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a	455.58146993988953
certain evening. “Well, then, since she has left Paris, and you are	383.0864560382805
sure of it, D’Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow	293.95099127696
you. You say we are going—”	477.8974820663922
“To see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make	406.86733772396224
haste, for we have lost much time already. _A propos_, inform Bazin.”	467.4702289985791
“Will Bazin go with us?” asked Aramis.	425.6294740414454
“Perhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to	405.1607195377094
Athos’s.”	301.09461576502304
Aramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at	463.3329018624529
Athos’s residence, said “Let us go then,” at the same time taking his	427.2675341207804
cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers	345.67217767589636
to see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search	412.6465555088563
was superfluous, he followed D’Artagnan, wondering to himself how this	375.9890513519983
young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had	462.868809550852
given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had	379.9586168528996
become of her.	307.9912647821908
Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of	357.8185402428079
D’Artagnan, and looking at him earnestly, “You have not spoken of this	362.3982730179914
lady?” said he.	335.67298488560823
“To nobody in the world.”	448.11929602098763
“Not even to Athos or Porthos?”	292.84302444708425
“I have not breathed a syllable to them.”	322.14402050500075
“Good enough!”	304.8987988135796
Tranquil on this important point, Aramis continued his way with	306.3770261563585
D’Artagnan, and both soon arrived at Athos’s dwelling. They found him	301.7633202273522
holding his leave of absence in one hand, and M. de Tréville’s note in	328.3876525561576
the other.	336.7321724823096
“Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this	342.9958528624157
letter, which I have just received?” said the astonished Athos.	344.6816016688614
MY DEAR ATHOS,	448.0543873342733
    I wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you should rest	399.9907847318242
    for a fortnight. Go, then, and take the waters of Forges, or any	352.5173957646547
    that may be more agreeable to you, and recuperate yourself as	442.11222998897324
    quickly as possible.	309.0355543217206
Yours affectionate,	361.88262281985914
DE TRÉVILLE	331.48435270479985
“Well, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow	319.3319824641114
me, Athos.”	383.8676098040659
“To the waters of Forges?”	317.3998421154615
“There or elsewhere.”	417.2524482171774
“In the king’s service?”	429.4553323239306
“Either the king’s or the queen’s. Are we not their Majesties’	474.7761060439981
servants?”	485.28057643728573
At that moment Porthos entered. “_Pardieu!_” said he, “here is a	346.8782278946876
strange thing! Since when, I wonder, in the Musketeers, did they grant	417.4968796214147
men leave of absence without their asking for it?”	475.70564756219744
“Since,” said D’Artagnan, “they have friends who ask it for them.”	294.2426061715501
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “it appears there’s something fresh here.”	399.8102499523345
“Yes, we are going—” said Aramis.	311.8806265788023
“To what country?” demanded Porthos.	344.1871423646859
“My faith! I don’t know much about it,” said Athos. “Ask D’Artagnan.”	465.77431210807106
“To London, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan.	368.21341302757514
“To London!” cried Porthos; “and what the devil are we going to do in	397.85905563084674
London?”	370.2783286918259
“That is what I am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must	396.6749110481287
trust to me.”	412.9650201165174
“But in order to go to London,” added Porthos, “money is needed, and I	340.12785524661143
have none.”	439.97705480601394
“Nor I,” said Aramis.	331.61718194119146
“Nor I,” said Athos.	346.11717925941963
“I have,” replied D’Artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,	415.2069383471459
and placing it on the table. “There are in this bag three hundred	475.0522820835219
pistoles. Let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to	388.67142555271295
London and back. Besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive	462.3407016735326
at London.”	360.67514571979046
“Why so?”	393.31724157481835
“Because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road.”	349.9757667016348
“Is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?”	331.08844692773954
“One of a most dangerous kind, I give you notice.”	375.1839672499585
“Ah! But if we do risk being killed,” said Porthos, “at least I should	455.1208493661533
like to know what for.”	363.1981122172825
“You would be all the wiser,” said Athos.	316.31432013239197
“And yet,” said Aramis, “I am somewhat of Porthos’s opinion.”	359.94561941335985
“Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? No. He says to you	442.3231591960591
jauntily, ‘Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in	301.5815769974851
Flanders; go and fight,’ and you go there. Why? You need give	487.7703622205966
yourselves no more uneasiness about this.”	386.37038429189454
“D’Artagnan is right,” said Athos; “here are our three leaves of	376.36957809207746
absence which came from Monsieur de Tréville, and here are three	351.174067166009
hundred pistoles which came from I don’t know where. So let us go and	359.8118025248505
get killed where we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so	403.1182678249085
many questions? D’Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.”	304.9041635689506
“And I also,” said Porthos.	424.85533313469773
“And I also,” said Aramis. “And, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris;	445.678142570889
I had need of distraction.”	403.3200380964043
“Well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,” said	372.38204774537735
D’Artagnan.	408.7385552149254
“And, now, when are we to go?” asked Athos.	481.56235124052307
“Immediately,” replied D’Artagnan; “we have not a minute to lose.”	342.2530046540544
“Hello, Grimaud! Planchet! Mousqueton! Bazin!” cried the four young	479.7483910504005
men, calling their lackeys, “clean my boots, and fetch the horses from	336.33563618448494
the hôtel.”	326.10681084767043
Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel, as at a	293.7391468339244
barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. Planchet, Grimaud,	387.0479517134635
Mousqueton, and Bazin set off at full speed.	324.26826637528717
“Now let us lay down the plan of campaign,” said Porthos. “Where do we	336.16688859491774
go first?”	296.8929337192389
“To Calais,” said D’Artagnan; “that is the most direct line to London.”	473.86609440261196
“Well,” said Porthos, “this is my advice—”	381.8026683622439
“Speak!”	316.38419541261743
“Four men traveling together would be suspected. D’Artagnan will give	380.07586382426024
each of us his instructions. I will go by the way of Boulogne to clear	470.40282622646896
the way; Athos will set out two hours after, by that of Amiens; Aramis	409.14598621267317
will follow us by that of Noyon; as to D’Artagnan, he will go by what	365.51780373204735
route he thinks is best, in Planchet’s clothes, while Planchet will	426.4308806765081
follow us like D’Artagnan, in the uniform of the Guards.”	306.34939331137934
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “my opinion is that it is not proper to allow	402.0214893438823
lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. A secret may, by	314.34649627189106
chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by	452.3427509860268
lackeys.”	430.90592195739293
“Porthos’s plan appears to me to be impracticable,” said D’Artagnan,	352.06657439731697
“inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give you.	349.08748922064245
I am the bearer of a letter, that is all. I have not, and I cannot make	340.5544139629256
three copies of that letter, because it is sealed. We must, then, as it	459.04167230388674
appears to me, travel in company. This letter is here, in this pocket,”	407.50425116444313
and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter. “If I should	473.1388057112037
be killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be	464.4827038647179
killed, it will be another’s turn, and so on—provided a single one	393.4130796523714
arrives, that is all that is required.”	433.3880269805368
“Bravo, D’Artagnan, your opinion is mine,” cried Athos, “Besides, we	325.19994477209195
must be consistent; I am going to take the waters, you will accompany	473.53104037314233
me. Instead of taking the waters of Forges, I go and take sea waters; I	471.69124098834124
am free to do so. If anyone wishes to stop us, I will show Monsieur de	368.0609647310605
Tréville’s letter, and you will show your leaves of absence. If we are	341.1240869696576
attacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly	451.0148657912396
maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of	332.153158561473
times in the sea. They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men;	379.4700951078804
whereas four men together make a troop. We will arm our four lackeys	312.3405815481068
with pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we	479.6149017795916
will give battle, and the survivor, as D’Artagnan says, will carry the	485.82515806094693
letter.”	470.63342263659126
“Well said,” cried Aramis; “you don’t often speak, Athos, but when you	436.8575800411355
do speak, it is like St. John of the Golden Mouth. I agree to Athos’s	469.7876805410412
plan. And you, Porthos?”	294.7114228770052
“I agree to it, too,” said Porthos, “if D’Artagnan approves of it.	480.9358302810855
D’Artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of	323.63869167826726
the enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute.”	433.63642957064144
“Well,” said D’Artagnan, “I decide that we should adopt Athos’s plan,	436.5164884402501
and that we set off in half an hour.”	368.55177859479653
“Agreed!” shouted the three Musketeers in chorus.	427.53214359324863
Each one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five	309.46543797285557
pistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.	363.86456313878296
Chapter XX.	300.9326931997017
THE JOURNEY	366.53614654730734
At two o’clock in the morning, our four adventurers left Paris by the	301.98273814379047
Barrière St. Denis. As long as it was dark they remained silent; in	442.0153620987661
spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity,	377.3811372925979
and apprehended ambushes on every side.	327.4966655346085
With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun	329.41611206110167
gaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the	298.0888753277841
eyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to	439.34376734914764
lose, was, after all, a good thing.	328.97641819124226
Besides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable. The black horses	319.64617862210247
of the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step of	468.33745988168073
these noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most	320.34139769633106
strict incognito. The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth.	363.48930167962516
All went well till they arrived at Chantilly, which they reached about	402.6012053047909
eight o’clock in the morning. They needed breakfast, and alighted at	339.5975482607851
the door of an _auberge_, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin	364.7163980658144
giving half his cloak to a poor man. They ordered the lackeys not to	380.7915789657111
unsaddle the horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off	416.76675629861165
again immediately.	362.33338042889295
They entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table. A	358.7897561216755
gentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated	345.21022775074164
at the same table, and was breakfasting. He opened the conversation	441.1272740219344
about rain and fine weather; the travelers replied. He drank to their	313.49993264577546
good health, and the travelers returned his politeness.	340.58171138685583
But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were	365.1216933400925
ready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to	406.33605097643226
Porthos to drink the health of the cardinal. Porthos replied that he	421.20068926903673
asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of	392.0507146534619
the king. The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his	336.8921219989113
Eminence. Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.	481.38657344541906
“You have committed a piece of folly,” said Athos, “but it can’t be	301.9003794500046
helped; there is no drawing back. Kill the fellow, and rejoin us as	297.32571173857184
soon as you can.”	489.1672975034592
All three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while	449.683581382005
Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the	419.2847671948315
thrusts known in the fencing schools.	318.6937798810983
“There goes one!” cried Athos, at the end of five hundred paces.	374.017902240597
“But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us?”	333.7885390116178
asked Aramis.	367.2696723875238
“Because, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took	406.6789450121471
him for the chief,” said D’Artagnan.	316.8766397864476
“I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,”	292.55626769940875
murmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.	382.23273487970124
At Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a	379.2920191935676
little as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did	314.0882543487278
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.	341.90003053786216
At a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high	335.95766334629724
banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the	490.23455878944276
road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging	432.7320814521421
holes and filling up the ruts with mud.	388.45634218292895
Aramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,	302.1127538709295
apostrophized them rather sharply. Athos wished to restrain him, but it	358.7158164250343
was too late. The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their	423.59877411667946
insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on	327.9481305960065
his horse against one of them.	423.25278637035626
Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each	485.5250161183925
took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were	476.7063823196965
outnumbered in weapons. Aramis received a ball which passed through his	305.77295170515333
shoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part	404.84613151083306
which prolongs the lower portion of the loins. Therefore Mousqueton	485.54250124586645
alone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not	467.40471836074187
being able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it	467.8914032880777
really was.	406.12762887229223
“It was an ambuscade!” shouted D’Artagnan. “Don’t waste a charge!	478.2720722837187
Forward!”	403.96148885083994
Aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried	330.7945027391671
him on with the others. Mousqueton’s horse rejoined them, and galloped	388.1217997823642
by the side of his companions.	315.7653152038878
“That will serve us for a relay,” said Athos.	460.38621595004804
“I would rather have had a hat,” said D’Artagnan. “Mine was carried	451.1390807303698
away by a ball. By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was	345.01852559700404
not in it.”	434.80054779415127
“They’ll kill poor Porthos when he comes up,” said Aramis.	451.81331726804603
“If Porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,”	481.32975394130005
said Athos. “My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not	352.9707251201385
intoxicated.”	466.63546119257455
They continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses	476.231199518964
were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse	472.7676584801197
service.	415.24923797047614
The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet	311.33736754513933
with less interruption; but at Crèvecœur, Aramis declared he could	474.8357851762049
proceed no farther. In fact, it required all the courage which he	364.92105696339695
concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so	320.60325201327396
far. He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support	376.40585149240485
him on his horse. They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left	363.1449151611028
Bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than	362.37658298518454
useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens.	417.08452583091764
“_Morbleu_,” said Athos, as soon as they were again in motion, “reduced	424.00664261765894
to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet! _Morbleu!_ I won’t be their	482.8063526000723
dupe, I will answer for it. I will neither open my mouth nor draw my	338.7673795505462
sword between this and Calais. I swear by—”	366.6796641550593
“Don’t waste time in swearing,” said D’Artagnan; “let us gallop, if our	301.4686750639165
horses will consent.”	447.9748583101815
And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses’ flanks, who thus	339.017388478458
vigorously stimulated recovered their energies. They arrived at Amiens	473.3336975950202
at midnight, and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden Lily.	335.72505918161687
The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. He	302.66903641828924
received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton	298.2020496284397
nightcap in the other. He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a	404.2075031333809
charming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the	411.1012835292388
opposite extremities of the hôtel. D’Artagnan and Athos refused them.	472.00112549776816
The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but	347.28183202337533
the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on	347.86018460757913
a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. The host insisted;	389.66220050800734
but the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.	406.7858584000012
They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within,	344.71167001328234
when someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there,	401.3280171026754
and recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. It was	320.1997159226628
indeed Planchet and Grimaud.	441.04422695510993
“Grimaud can take care of the horses,” said Planchet. “If you are	377.72614296795564
willing, gentlemen, I will sleep across your doorway, and you will then	336.56207364740055
be certain that nobody can reach you.”	378.0319270199181
“And on what will you sleep?” said D’Artagnan.	320.0397745171077
“Here is my bed,” replied Planchet, producing a bundle of straw.	453.1235279782128
“Come, then,” said D’Artagnan, “you are right. Mine host’s face does	316.06480918144456
not please me at all; it is too gracious.”	314.51927728805435
“Nor me either,” said Athos.	403.34710410884975
Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the	477.11446530536176
doorway, while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable,	339.08689736570886
undertaking that by five o’clock in the morning he and the four horses	307.1389311606624
should be ready.	329.1606407982948
The night was quiet enough. Toward two o’clock in the morning somebody	459.40477749810543
endeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and	308.94885634309657
cried, “Who goes there?” somebody replied that he was mistaken, and	488.7489295889654
went away.	388.90327547260745
At four o’clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the	390.60138498176923
stables. Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable	472.4219248267435
boys had beaten him. When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad	344.4055638011691
lying senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.	322.60419926923885
Planchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but	439.2894727991591
the horses were all used up. Mousqueton’s horse which had traveled for	482.99987604221127
five or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able	391.2686466043286
to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary	310.49172288600613
surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the	395.23098083470643
host’s horses, had bled Mousqueton’s.	350.8544800493053
This began to be annoying. All these successive accidents were perhaps	382.58201679941953
the result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. Athos and	451.8503644898149
D’Artagnan went out, while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were	474.9448092396598
not three horses for sale in the neighborhood. At the door stood two	357.630034930686
horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. These would just have suited	310.51217878613664
them. He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had	393.5112222840272
passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the	308.33502899582345
host.	481.19580857051346
Athos went down to pay the reckoning, while D’Artagnan and Planchet	469.06306641255514
stood at the street door. The host was in a lower and back room, to	438.11130442344574
which Athos was requested to go.	309.94994832756345
Athos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to	293.91109088199346
pay the bill. The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the	437.30998291573815
drawers of which was partly open. He took the money which Athos offered	340.42173407902567
to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,	375.47943817474794
suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his	322.81012189290703
companions arrested as forgers.	466.42050606095063
“You blackguard!” cried Athos, going toward him, “I’ll cut your ears	357.88686484997834
off!”	417.56284438521465
At the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side	346.4709592497129
doors, and rushed upon Athos.	432.1802088657838
“I am taken!” shouted Athos, with all the power of his lungs. “Go on,	457.5190135045411
D’Artagnan! Spur, spur!” and he fired two pistols.	455.5572059839832
D’Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened	399.48304329897445
the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried	382.5379090398707
their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.	454.96662988406797
“Do you know what has become of Athos?” asked D’Artagnan of Planchet,	388.6600345774052
as they galloped on.	456.36379609252003
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, “I saw one fall at each of his two	348.7632063048726
shots, and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting	294.48216068276963
with his sword with the others.”	311.8209289848153
“Brave Athos!” murmured D’Artagnan, “and to think that we are compelled	407.6508569448372
to leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence. Forward,	484.7326008689488
Planchet, forward! You are a brave fellow.”	389.3947649082191
“As I told you, monsieur,” replied Planchet, “Picards are found out by	300.12018610546545
being used. Besides, I am here in my own country, and that excites me.”	328.0086550128823
And both, with free use of the spur, arrived at St. Omer without	476.25119494353453
drawing bit. At St. Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles	455.30657750679006
passed under their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from	364.5928816769591
their hands on the stones of the street, after they departed again.	330.11997386935604
At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, D’Artagnan’s horse gave	303.4572324287075
out, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood	434.9583417242395
flowing from his eyes and his nose. There still remained Planchet’s	407.4608134273004
horse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step.	342.8064734886809
Fortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the	317.2633695242428
city; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the	308.26628227632597
quay. Planchet called his master’s attention to a gentleman who had	439.81165106725996
just arrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty	473.09149497076396
paces. They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared	462.60266259419814
to be in great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired	313.92678555647024
if he could not instantly cross over to England.	343.0537481778573
“Nothing would be more easy,” said the captain of a vessel ready to set	450.70760287426066
sail, “but this morning came an order to let no one leave without	294.19462811179045
express permission from the cardinal.”	452.5183961311561
“I have that permission,” said the gentleman, drawing the paper from	295.3134515916599
his pocket; “here it is.”	374.6816699304814
“Have it examined by the governor of the port,” said the shipmaster,	429.0519625462104
“and give me the preference.”	335.2877973412205
“Where shall I find the governor?”	481.6525599073955
“At his country house.”	487.3232826367675
“And that is situated?”	333.9526111842871
“At a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from	467.108825897948
here—at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof.”	409.1312532792539
“Very well,” said the gentleman. And, with his lackey, he took the road	357.44516670270633
to the governor’s country house.	323.67820787437864
D’Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five	427.0470177492597
hundred paces. Once outside the city, D’Artagnan overtook the gentleman	319.1711066870597
as he was entering a little wood.	475.0335264527926
“Monsieur, you appear to be in great haste?”	462.32307600218985
“No one can be more so, monsieur.”	475.4143116600323
“I am sorry for that,” said D’Artagnan; “for as I am in great haste	472.432896444395
likewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service.”	392.29970044252883
“What?”	308.7950131604343
“To let me sail first.”	355.3007042685803
“That’s impossible,” said the gentleman; “I have traveled sixty leagues	429.90290944660956
in forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London.”	403.9466343214466
“I have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten o’clock	354.6187625010293
in the morning I must be in London.”	478.5427438417747
“Very sorry, monsieur; but I was here first, and will not sail second.”	401.61537338938837
“I am sorry, too, monsieur; but I arrived second, and must sail first.”	344.1869092783809
“The king’s service!” said the gentleman.	299.4873353294522
“My own service!” said D’Artagnan.	327.69348314364487
“But this is a needless quarrel you seek with me, as it seems to me.”	349.8939592504068
“_Parbleu!_ What do you desire it to be?”	308.1719660019246
“What do you want?”	323.69704043461326
“Would you like to know?”	294.5596219588497
“Certainly.”	480.7533879029123
“Well, then, I wish that order of which you are bearer, seeing that I	464.3514896661666
have not one of my own and must have one.”	382.28087596599386
“You jest, I presume.”	341.88417286209864
“I never jest.”	421.2865628915387
“Let me pass!”	440.7985679130398
“You shall not pass.”	323.82224480496114
“My brave young man, I will blow out your brains. _Hola_, Lubin, my	352.06370899315516
pistols!”	306.35923239004035
“Planchet,” called out D’Artagnan, “take care of the lackey; I will	330.100574159653
manage the master.”	362.6213511007851
Planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being	367.7798204769554
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and	331.20149445988875
placed his knee upon his breast.	442.62359122569075
“Go on with your affair, monsieur,” cried Planchet; “I have finished	401.11055924240395
mine.”	319.6416426327718
Seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon D’Artagnan;	429.58395161719625
but he had too strong an adversary. In three seconds D’Artagnan had	411.6255848825259
wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, “One for Athos, one	319.5417754805409
for Porthos; and one for Aramis!”	407.3856443442779
At the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. D’Artagnan believed him	357.90543789103504
to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose	376.7037809187134
of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for	392.3084806789532
it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point	326.1975040243054
into D’Artagnan’s breast, crying, “One for you!”	311.32990627049367
“And one for me—the best for last!” cried D’Artagnan, furious, nailing	411.0197164275462
him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.	364.0006187107927
This time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted. D’Artagnan	462.5388937595817
searched his pockets, and took from one of them the order for the	378.49222837256264
passage. It was in the name of Comte de Wardes.	489.99319505134406
Then, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely	481.21591665070184
twenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived	442.17563087950293
of sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable	486.7174322397062
destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of	467.7357834989342
people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that	390.76081322889416
they exist. But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin,	375.87039866365456
who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might.	338.5559060369199
Planchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could.	384.666083576774
“Monsieur,” said he, “as long as I hold him in this manner, he can’t	366.6115638185514
cry, I’ll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again. I know	314.77801851159626
him for a Norman, and Normans are obstinate.”	437.94944880448736
In fact, tightly held as he was, Lubin endeavored still to cry out.	395.1054900654129
“Stay!” said D’Artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged	355.6157134100356
him.	408.1350049981479
“Now,” said Planchet, “let us bind him to a tree.”	438.58460443857336
This being properly done, they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his	328.62529902493395
servant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the	415.1240281146148
bound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident	463.33666477261875
they were likely to remain there till the next day.	350.75509586205123
“And now,” said D’Artagnan, “to the Governor’s.”	445.0405924133281
“But you are wounded, it seems,” said Planchet.	430.2463586307587
“Oh, that’s nothing! Let us attend to what is more pressing first, and	347.9459778093315
then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very	303.3156070177855
dangerous.”	409.1999659663839
And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country	415.03621304605053
house of the worthy functionary.	336.9498629768446
The Comte de Wardes was announced, and D’Artagnan was introduced.	372.17308538191173
“You have an order signed by the cardinal?” said the governor.	453.72245198402766
“Yes, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan; “here it is.”	343.9127925124403
“Ah, ah! It is quite regular and explicit,” said the governor.	472.32897918793714
“Most likely,” said D’Artagnan; “I am one of his most faithful	310.5204054453989
servants.”	308.95468648724903
“It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from	417.2933855355407
crossing to England?”	441.62963692962114
“Yes; a certain D’Artagnan, a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in	374.1197401035665
company with three of his friends, with the intention of going to	476.3711910264591
London.”	477.2431235799979
“Do you know him personally?” asked the governor.	460.4014706947163
“Whom?”	390.73492091249113
“This D’Artagnan.”	358.9225589028657
“Perfectly well.”	464.04877550969303
“Describe him to me, then.”	358.84545493737545
“Nothing more easy.”	365.3502577543717
And D’Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de	491.83940238853154
Wardes.	449.386944799742
“Is he accompanied?”	461.3790111071123
“Yes; by a lackey named Lubin.”	343.2257977579484
“We will keep a sharp lookout for them; and if we lay hands on them his	490.8651322943731
Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good	437.3492932683058
escort.”	380.2424927535586
“And by doing so, Monsieur the Governor,” said D’Artagnan, “you will	321.3402780535117
deserve well of the cardinal.”	443.5335664945527
“Shall you see him on your return, Monsieur Count?”	301.9681232052741
“Without a doubt.”	376.69979126055296
“Tell him, I beg you, that I am his humble servant.”	382.4925958060039
“I will not fail.”	486.38641096106915
Delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport	357.356505917602
and delivered it to D’Artagnan. D’Artagnan lost no time in useless	424.3338501615683
compliments. He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. Once	350.1230144076962
outside, he and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a	311.3118062542961
long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.	333.0565864807483
The vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the	465.61386501640004
wharf. “Well?” said he, on perceiving D’Artagnan.	439.6307754691731
“Here is my pass countersigned,” said the latter.	362.1314844156033
“And that other gentleman?	460.035743361089
“He will not go today,” said D’Artagnan; “but here, I’ll pay you for us	386.52988206518273
two.”	477.4194562182919
“In that case let us go,” said the shipmaster.	362.740462904049
“Let us go,” repeated D’Artagnan.	409.37795472744665
He leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were	448.8220130827854
on board. It was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when	330.16886734477356
D’Artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. It was the cannon which	460.9523925141482
announced the closing of the port.	369.4117646207076
He had now leisure to look to his wound. Fortunately, as D’Artagnan had	383.0262229455791
thought, it was not dangerous. The point of the sword had touched a	334.30780615719107
rib, and glanced along the bone. Still further, his shirt had stuck to	378.49943762580045
the wound, and he had lost only a few drops of blood.	342.94012145915286
D’Artagnan was worn out with fatigue. A mattress was laid upon the deck	295.51917304958545
for him. He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.	349.5877287236142
On the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues	384.0774406762079
from the coast of England. The breeze had been so light all night, they	346.1828600434025
had made but little progress. At ten o’clock the vessel cast anchor in	325.0345057883295
the harbor of Dover, and at half past ten D’Artagnan placed his foot on	376.1046363942205
English land, crying, “Here I am at last!”	317.89938997077815
But that was not all; they must get to London. In England the post was	386.7514885875577
well served. D’Artagnan and Planchet took each a post horse, and a	304.1771150892215
postillion rode before them. In a few hours they were in the capital.	431.4200691249772
D’Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English; but	491.6581656423838
he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone	390.7766855677724
pointed out to him the way to the duke’s hôtel.	489.2953550803604
The duke was at Windsor hunting with the king. D’Artagnan inquired for	303.78746575249363
the confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all	395.96689230230055
his voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from	450.2120797462914
Paris on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his	433.8986964462731
master instantly.	312.3917858023079
The confidence with which D’Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was	326.04374849438
the name of this minister of the minister. He ordered two horses to be	483.0564588009338
saddled, and himself went as guide to the young Guardsman. As for	440.29384374983727
Planchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the	432.3480728617559
poor lad’s strength was almost exhausted. D’Artagnan seemed iron.	367.5294173485434
On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the	440.4327893328319
king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. In twenty	378.846792214791
minutes they were on the spot named. Patrick soon caught the sound of	337.9090660485376
his master’s voice calling his falcon.	325.6670571740295
“Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke?” asked Patrick.	425.5214125889364
“The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont	387.723559725472
Neuf, opposite the Samaritaine.”	434.6074950066948
“A singular introduction!”	300.56360642120325
“You will find that it is as good as another.”	313.9508238061207
Patrick galloped off, reached the duke, and announced to him in the	477.80728837990364
terms directed that a messenger awaited him.	376.05772030724063
Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that	322.45402552692985
something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be	408.97292928945626
informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and	350.9795815796343
recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into	347.25730953754044
a gallop, and rode straight up to D’Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept	326.9839996510193
in the background.	454.17585893698333
“No misfortune has happened to the queen?” cried Buckingham, the	407.5222865041494
instant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question.	473.7190120556579
“I believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from	435.2750668570951
which your Grace alone can extricate her.”	476.66755828555375
“I!” cried Buckingham. “What is it? I should be too happy to be of any	305.35838042778823
service to her. Speak, speak!”	479.4128191971349
“Take this letter,” said D’Artagnan.	463.04000834245704
“This letter! From whom comes this letter?”	321.6878234851611
“From her Majesty, as I think.”	427.21291973937605
“From her Majesty!” said Buckingham, becoming so pale that D’Artagnan	431.9997709403064
feared he would faint as he broke the seal.	347.144286430079
“What is this rent?” said he, showing D’Artagnan a place where it had	455.611651098694
been pierced through.	420.52475506173226
“Ah,” said D’Artagnan, “I did not see that; it was the sword of the	421.88289522040634
Comte de Wardes which made that hole, when he gave me a good thrust in	431.81371052680424
the breast.”	418.45637589848764
“You are wounded?” asked Buckingham, as he opened the letter.	400.93001385403
“Oh, nothing but a scratch,” said D’Artagnan.	382.248205998859
“Just heaven, what have I read?” cried the duke. “Patrick, remain here,	479.4889934736315
or rather join the king, wherever he may be, and tell his Majesty that	457.70433587459945
I humbly beg him to excuse me, but an affair of the greatest importance	466.32796673142593
recalls me to London. Come, monsieur, come!” and both set off towards	486.87392455162495
the capital at full gallop.	380.4420020627773
Chapter XXI.	365.04590340414654
THE COUNTESS DE WINTER	456.5166345442554
As they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from D’Artagnan, not	381.26537492375695
all that had happened, but what D’Artagnan himself knew. By adding all	418.9253175413352
that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances,	474.6418067455029
he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the	424.6616424195008
seriousness of which, for the rest, the queen’s letter, short but	426.40399949507616
explicit, gave him the clue. But that which astonished him most was	333.77403077132027
that the cardinal, so deeply interested in preventing this young man	299.75950100565314
from setting his foot in England, had not succeeded in arresting him on	320.9670474052
the road. It was then, upon the manifestation of this astonishment,	312.095761935073
that D’Artagnan related to him the precaution taken, and how, thanks to	386.2274815229574
the devotion of his three friends, whom he had left scattered and	322.5484190359255
bleeding on the road, he had succeeded in coming off with a single	326.04513762371215
sword thrust, which had pierced the queen’s letter and for which he had	391.00868286117657
repaid M. de Wardes with such terrible coin. While he was listening to	357.4022108728958
this recital, delivered with the greatest simplicity, the duke looked	433.93516724603046
from time to time at the young man with astonishment, as if he could	444.36715156842524
not comprehend how so much prudence, courage, and devotedness could be	339.19373086020187
allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years.	470.6551750163751
The horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the	315.31472313123777
gates of London. D’Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke	439.7429383574414
would slacken his pace, but it was not so. He kept on his way at the	341.2068067376405
same rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road. In	310.54956439288344
fact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind	443.6149279201161
happened; but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became	348.50383971505164
of those he had knocked down. D’Artagnan followed him amid cries which	389.80179813215096
strongly resembled curses.	383.80557850858025
On entering the court of his hôtel, Buckingham sprang from his horse,	356.80447925780965
and without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his	316.5369784482122
neck, and sprang toward the vestibule. D’Artagnan did the same, with a	366.3773650902406
little more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he	412.274367230904
fully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four	306.87739249717094
grooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with	462.99477970200394
the steeds.	313.01946008879844
The duke walked so fast that D’Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up	460.6738450121756
with him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which	368.45856802841485
even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at	419.15312404192224
length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of	426.8857703595289
richness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the	460.17224969147685
tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore	441.1266357311364
suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal. With discretion	370.71383979969477
D’Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed	484.5242780055506
the threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young	450.30824144189944
man, “Come in!” cried he, “and if you have the good fortune to be	400.4572316259715
admitted to her Majesty’s presence, tell her what you have seen.”	407.0014923258523
Encouraged by this invitation, D’Artagnan followed the duke, who closed	315.12628752637295
the door after them. The two found themselves in a small chapel covered	388.3087696049116
with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly	321.387739778337
lighted with a vast number of candles. Over a species of altar, and	293.1817225492965
beneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes,	435.586793223999
was a full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its	337.3549002743003
resemblance that D’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it.	343.3052726871124
One might believe the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and	398.38464961928753
beneath the portrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs.	360.52763270998383
The duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before	393.2513622153262
a crucifix, and opened the casket. “There,” said he, drawing from the	432.03749965702616
casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, “there	344.1769018773198
are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with	485.45731584002
me. The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again. Her will	449.4413266106921
be done, like that of God, in all things.”	414.03838161684934
Then, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with	470.20613274158177
which he was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry.	398.4107525741683
“What is the matter?” exclaimed D’Artagnan, anxiously; “what has	416.5552818586383
happened to you, my Lord?”	338.396203407454
“All is lost!” cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; “two of	328.8643337224423
the studs are wanting, there are only ten.”	358.9552430500744
“Can you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been	421.5359067609237
stolen?”	368.3572219154667
“They have been stolen,” replied the duke, “and it is the cardinal who	421.95880671133136
has dealt this blow. Hold; see! The ribbons which held them have been	484.7626126964792
cut with scissors.”	307.8584056991019
“If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who	368.07753830727614
stole them still has them in his hands.”	358.92243465148067
“Wait, wait!” said the duke. “The only time I have worn these studs was	435.1681983516329
at a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de	489.26211163104705
Winter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that	407.55508554783523
ball. That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous	476.3085659143634
woman. I have never seen her from that day. The woman is an agent of	434.3931186980297
the cardinal.”	417.2742101892892
“He has agents, then, throughout the world?” cried D’Artagnan.	306.13197921442486
“Oh, yes,” said Buckingham, grating his teeth with rage. “Yes, he is a	332.5392198707567
terrible antagonist. But when is this ball to take place?”	480.0346963971067
“Monday next.”	408.2516123001495
“Monday next! Still five days before us. That’s more time than we want.	329.09367775530694
Patrick!” cried the duke, opening the door of the chapel, “Patrick!”	423.6825604323211
His confidential valet appeared.	362.8032182285844
“My jeweler and my secretary.”	484.4790461090131
The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed	395.0948459800873
to obey blindly and without reply.	293.52627571232284
But although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary	481.3412560390135
who first made his appearance. This was simply because he lived in the	458.53480747111104
hôtel. He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing	466.8014019774804
orders with his own hand.	327.27038574484675
“Mr. Jackson,” said he, “go instantly to the Lord Chancellor, and tell	357.36459022888
him that I charge him with the execution of these orders. I wish them	346.0763926013194
to be promulgated immediately.”	415.665187420426
“But, my Lord, if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives	358.83899129487406
which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure,	359.30475971642045
what shall I reply?”	453.011987524823
“That such is my pleasure, and that I answer for my will to no man.”	488.0930967398582
“Will that be the answer,” replied the secretary, smiling, “which he	401.4677613082265
must transmit to his Majesty if, by chance, his Majesty should have the	480.161817168252
curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great	351.2214046771308
Britain?”	356.5110100413111
“You are right, Mr. Jackson,” replied Buckingham. “He will say, in that	437.30991827933394
case, to the king that I am determined on war, and that this measure is	328.09300440283516
my first act of hostility against France.”	358.74196991927806
The secretary bowed and retired.	477.7767076340908
“We are safe on that side,” said Buckingham, turning toward D’Artagnan.	399.5159238110365
“If the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till	421.78488637604585
after you.”	390.8788321254766
“How so?”	294.58919901967226
“I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his	431.8185293880641
Majesty’s ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift	297.7799922549102
an anchor.”	293.97291223931785
D’Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the	443.4197827311158
unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king	339.79637441642933
in the prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression	373.96811970317043
of the young man’s face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.	305.89578466425235
“Yes,” said he, “yes, Anne of Austria is my true queen. Upon a word	314.9685391572737
from her, I would betray my country, I would betray my king, I would	466.7806984130985
betray my God. She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle	470.4630196143863
the assistance I promised them; I have not done so. I broke my word, it	340.62672528131196
is true; but what signifies that? I obeyed my love; and have I not been	412.70568423936834
richly paid for that obedience? It was to that obedience I owe her	460.48482583350966
portrait.”	334.28404786023947
D’Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the	483.4916331626398
destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in	453.0746765369073
these reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman—one of	391.0972573691909
the most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he	379.099727800054
gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.	346.75586335487816
“Mr. O’Reilly,” said the duke, leading him into the chapel, “look at	468.63815379990695
these diamond studs, and tell me what they are worth apiece.”	387.2766761835286
The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were	408.8178278629117
set, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and	460.04796117160464
without hesitation said, “Fifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord.”	321.93569728655666
“How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?	426.15318067337057
You see there are two wanting.”	444.41393588789595
“Eight days, my Lord.”	449.27125853555754
“I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by	450.4790388457727
the day after tomorrow.”	488.5830957717103
“My Lord, they shall be yours.”	324.3528636905167
“You are a jewel of a man, Mr. O’Reilly; but that is not all. These	378.99029932753007
studs cannot be trusted to anybody; it must be done in the palace.”	394.6299217949895
“Impossible, my Lord! There is no one but myself can so execute them	411.6029523962608
that one cannot tell the new from the old.”	342.87691125515505
“Therefore, my dear Mr. O’Reilly, you are my prisoner. And if you wish	452.55515652997764
ever to leave my palace, you cannot; so make the best of it. Name to me	307.44383703408636
such of your workmen as you need, and point out the tools they must	431.47267370033296
bring.”	309.5997446896049
The goldsmith knew the duke. He knew all objection would be useless,	437.4930219530793
and instantly determined how to act.	321.0239206778415
“May I be permitted to inform my wife?” said he.	450.8665380917916
“Oh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. O’Reilly. Your	438.2066417734857
captivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience	307.2962838334295
deserves its indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the	475.54283578112376
studs, an order for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the	308.70245428207596
annoyance I cause you.”	390.3435088162944
D’Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this	450.0321959001876
minister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.	361.0922460770733
As to the goldsmith, he wrote to his wife, sending her the order for	439.35130299055953
the thousand pistoles, and charging her to send him, in exchange, his	457.75915411236997
most skillful apprentice, an assortment of diamonds, of which he gave	421.9461840792808
the names and the weight, and the necessary tools.	442.08636506597225
Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him, and	301.6101171741629
which, at the end of half an hour, was transformed into a workshop.	309.20020497460627
Then he placed a sentinel at each door, with an order to admit nobody	412.6468296955623
upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_, Patrick. We need not add	380.17479906628523
that the goldsmith, O’Reilly, and his assistant, were prohibited from	478.6389264878901
going out under any pretext. This point, settled, the duke turned to	385.4606117114344
D’Artagnan. “Now, my young friend,” said he, “England is all our own.	350.25716263326524
What do you wish for? What do you desire?”	383.4250649078114
“A bed, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan. “At present, I confess, that is	295.4807982153563
the thing I stand most in need of.”	366.3796012603369
Buckingham gave D’Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own. He wished to	474.8313300812234
have the young man at hand—not that he at all mistrusted him, but for	366.6955861317432
the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the	443.784580080484
queen.	412.76363840343333
In one hour after, the ordinance was published in London that no vessel	475.2790024366353
bound for France should leave port, not even the packet boat with	305.06228332255404
letters. In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between	488.2407758595249
the two kingdoms.	365.84772566664185
On the day after the morrow, by eleven o’clock, the two diamond studs	386.74988819141953
were finished, and they were so completely imitated, so perfectly	318.81861594490573
alike, that Buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones,	356.6688077864847
and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was. He	478.92527503601593
immediately called D’Artagnan. “Here,” said he to him, “are the diamond	441.2508982120778
studs that you came to bring; and be my witness that I have done all	292.35762707174035
that human power could do.”	306.76991648715705
“Be satisfied, my Lord, I will tell all that I have seen. But does your	330.2379368456815
Grace mean to give me the studs without the casket?”	464.4632778282848
“The casket would encumber you. Besides, the casket is the more	360.11724343018307
precious from being all that is left to me. You will say that I keep	357.51895006300686
it.”	423.8144726852769
“I will perform your commission, word for word, my Lord.”	382.73682425096945
“And now,” resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, “how	359.0120111965324
shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you?”	314.06213650903703
D’Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes. He saw that the duke	323.7124070614292
was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea	454.03345616455795
that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with	318.5790260983376
English gold was strangely repugnant to him.	320.6590164729221
“Let us understand each other, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan, “and let	485.98409771561774
us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake.	354.1825101686334
I am in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of	487.0695529556623
the company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law,	475.06018802845426
Monsieur de Tréville, is particularly attached to their Majesties. What	451.4318080986342
I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your	468.3237137968039
Grace. And still further, it is very probable I should not have done	419.6496916062148
anything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to	303.70967191319147
someone who is my lady, as the queen is yours.”	489.3609570444197
“Yes,” said the duke, smiling, “and I even believe that I know that	420.9933691209202
other person; it is—”	447.8516192393794
“My Lord, I have not named her!” interrupted the young man, warmly.	454.30744645409777
“That is true,” said the duke; “and it is to this person I am bound to	467.0351924987999
discharge my debt of gratitude.”	344.60388630938826
“You have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is	356.19931488158517
question of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but	398.03002480890314
an Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much	448.6116847274691
greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at	450.1592334687409
Windsor or the corridors of the Louvre—all which, however, will not	475.36659476016587
prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from	309.8285132753433
laying down my life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I	296.03748171798907
repeat it to your Grace, without your having personally on that account	326.6629625363299
more to thank me for in this second interview than for what I did for	386.03985060006136
you in the first.”	438.11443269633526
“We say, ‘Proud as a Scotsman,’” murmured the Duke of Buckingham.	315.3374488811665
“And we say, ‘Proud as a Gascon,’” replied D’Artagnan. “The Gascons are	349.55995486155405
the Scots of France.”	347.1824654544497
D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and was retiring.	354.9232010689155
“Well, are you going away in that manner? Where, and how?”	324.36369718280315
“That’s true!”	318.91542501266883
“Fore Gad, these Frenchmen have no consideration!”	393.12477768413765
“I had forgotten that England was an island, and that you were the king	378.05036559728586
of it.”	474.0685699100705
“Go to the riverside, ask for the brig _Sund_, and give this letter to	457.33732767468473
the captain; he will convey you to a little port, where certainly you	322.4011083379175
are not expected, and which is ordinarily only frequented by	355.4669855119666
fishermen.”	362.7920717297632
“The name of that port?”	349.97181868283883
“St. Valery; but listen. When you have arrived there you will go to a	471.39316335914395
mean tavern, without a name and without a sign—a mere fisherman’s hut.	350.3400984976239
You cannot be mistaken; there is but one.”	411.4962577534982
“Afterward?”	322.75288833227546
“You will ask for the host, and will repeat to him the word ‘Forward!’”	426.5316076928357
“Which means?”	455.9493109119487
“In French, _En avant_. It is the password. He will give you a horse	333.1840779253199
all saddled, and will point out to you the road you ought to take. You	404.302768032889
will find, in the same way, four relays on your route. If you will give	340.7597484734211
at each of these relays your address in Paris, the four horses will	486.69765462638986
follow you thither. You already know two of them, and you appeared to	313.58410436296134
appreciate them like a judge. They were those we rode on; and you may	478.8507975838504
rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them. These horses	382.8586767498582
are equipped for the field. However proud you may be, you will not	377.33678644302717
refuse to accept one of them, and to request your three companions to	468.00237452143296
accept the others—that is, in order to make war against us. Besides,	304.17784935561855
the end justified the means, as you Frenchmen say, does it not?”	366.7167719015704
“Yes, my Lord, I accept them,” said D’Artagnan; “and if it please God,	293.8824636826872
we will make a good use of your presents.”	360.97121881272835
“Well, now, your hand, young man. Perhaps we shall soon meet on the	465.7917573011727
field of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I	340.73089443896106
hope.”	424.20377210094426
“Yes, my Lord; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies.”	451.2522839179232
“Be satisfied; I promise you that.”	482.2843265361032
“I depend upon your word, my Lord.”	326.20348982887543
D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible	423.55283479294394
to the riverside. Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that	487.7126539847171
had been named to him, delivered his letter to the captain, who after	359.21851693819843
having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate	383.55277353184005
preparations to sail.	349.5413502387226
Fifty vessels were waiting to set out. Passing alongside one of them,	393.09835290940526
D’Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung—the same	491.2704915474794
whom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom D’Artagnan had	396.5719072322827
thought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair	363.67162995096555
wind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a	391.5887273755774
glimpse of her.	376.3389017526247
The next day about nine o’clock in the morning, he landed at St.	388.0536654808101
Valery. D’Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily	347.3656204311535
discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it. War between	373.0719055768143
England and France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly	301.7070988707151
sailors were having a carousal.	462.27746052829343
D’Artagnan made his way through the crowd, advanced toward the host,	321.2353757314513
and pronounced the word “Forward!” The host instantly made him a sign	357.40488964262556
to follow, went out with him by a door which opened into a yard, led	318.46350490507587
him to the stable, where a saddled horse awaited him, and asked him if	456.2354734413164
he stood in need of anything else.	444.437790185615
“I want to know the route I am to follow,” said D’Artagnan.	449.9808779527623
“Go from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufchâtel. At Neufchâtel,	389.3868601051144
go to the tavern of the Golden Harrow, give the password to the	332.03928481621955
landlord, and you will find, as you have here, a horse ready saddled.”	429.47087701991416
“Have I anything to pay?” demanded D’Artagnan.	331.7306492201752
“Everything is paid,” replied the host, “and liberally. Begone, and may	433.6044715177386
God guide you!”	385.383155062078
“Amen!” cried the young man, and set off at full gallop.	435.5801728821198
Four hours later he was in Neufchâtel. He strictly followed the	343.00596953285344
instructions he had received. At Neufchâtel, as at St. Valery, he found	365.3017301558354
a horse quite ready and awaiting him. He was about to remove the	437.81380045181515
pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill,	437.26566518202196
but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols.	449.91099412377014
“Your address at Paris?”	364.7327965372239
“Hôtel of the Guards, company of Dessessart.”	393.46852561786363
“Enough,” replied the questioner.	302.2249374529836
“Which route must I take?” demanded D’Artagnan, in his turn.	365.92248069167835
“That of Rouen; but you will leave the city on your right. You must	483.4617880693401
stop at the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one	338.10134017404124
tavern—the Shield of France. Don’t condemn it from appearances; you	307.96720820052917
will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this.”	380.66003385911546
“The same password?”	393.9409195569794
“Exactly.”	437.3336160212921
“Adieu, master!”	349.3308127225994
“A good journey, gentlemen! Do you want anything?”	425.9408990426091
D’Artagnan shook his head, and set off at full speed. At Eccuis, the	484.20197905975044
same scene was repeated. He found as provident a host and a fresh	320.84736894634676
horse. He left his address as he had done before, and set off again at	367.05713598096685
the same pace for Pontoise. At Pontoise he changed his horse for the	316.1029049358102
last time, and at nine o’clock galloped into the yard of Tréville’s	384.5039083066901
hôtel. He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve	357.39788259163095
hours.	361.82593711093386
M. de Tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning;	323.13626424827254
only, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he	445.11665371305116
informed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre,	453.4816173795266
and that he might repair at once to his post.	442.2661364661926
Chapter XXII.	486.7286055626121
THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON	338.7118042637383
On the morrow, nothing was talked of in Paris but the ball which the	399.47987506645086
aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen, and in which	437.0383019447529
their Majesties were to dance the famous La Merlaison—the favorite	414.089355427811
ballet of the king.	298.13037918215787
Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hôtel de Ville for	374.6898759494378
this important evening. The city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon	426.2776410632463
which the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had	385.7744060212354
ornamented the chambers with two hundred _flambeaux_ of white wax, a	389.1157800499642
piece of luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were	434.9530074213449
ordered, and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon	379.3658354055402
condition, said the report, that they should be played all night.	334.03658804729804
At ten o’clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the	489.33501902348536
king’s Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that	341.0744931775383
body, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him	426.005002991532
all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel. These keys were	427.9262473619037
given up to him instantly. Each of them had a ticket attached to it, by	337.4603501317003
which it might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la	350.3975424923326
Coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues.	433.693003829844
At eleven o’clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards,	458.9511063695186
bringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately	371.20365634789846
through the Hôtel de Ville, at the doors assigned them.	424.51125625638815
At three o’clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the	340.6533593418325
other Swiss. The company of French guards was composed of half of M.	358.5198785608789
Duhallier’s men and half of M. Dessessart’s men.	481.5336787040044
At six in the evening the guests began to come. As fast as they	380.1891195740501
entered, they were placed in the grand saloon, on the platforms	386.8325289515629
prepared for them.	460.7603351628002
At nine o’clock Madame la Première Présidente arrived. As next to the	482.41787069787983
queen, she was the most considerable personage of the fête, she was	489.5790713034402
received by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that	445.30601926629623
which the queen was to occupy.	348.9676836450889
At ten o’clock, the king’s collation, consisting of preserves and other	482.1718765264145
delicacies, was prepared in the little room on the side of the church	335.6461519712357
of St. Jean, in front of the silver buffet of the city, which was	490.27365134598426
guarded by four archers.	451.9372347555494
At midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard. It was the	385.14856540928963
king, who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to	409.43230452198077
the Hôtel de Ville, and which were all illuminated with colored	454.5587424016933
lanterns.	435.68211076836405
Immediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by	312.8536293042985
six sergeants, each holding a _flambeau_ in his hand, went to attend	344.6379514510859
upon the king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the	464.11784405052197
merchants made him the speech of welcome—a compliment to which his	340.7473656831155
Majesty replied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame	378.6369424914371
upon the cardinal, who had detained him till eleven o’clock, talking of	363.7248749029436
affairs of state.	476.44935022807397
His Majesty, in full dress, was accompanied by his royal Highness, M.	468.3175345696127
le Comte de Soissons, by the Grand Prior, by the Duc de Longueville, by	456.1296515919373
the Duc d’Eubœuf, by the Comte d’Harcourt, by the Comte de la	407.15719291581854
Roche-Guyon, by M. de Liancourt, by M. de Baradas, by the Comte de	418.0278751705233
Cramail, and by the Chevalier de Souveray. Everybody noticed that the	467.4257640257519
king looked dull and preoccupied.	365.9600787635739
A private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsieur.	427.67381672544735
In each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses. The same had	427.0176469673331
been done for the queen and Madame the President. The nobles and ladies	491.982355627364
of their Majesties’ suites were to dress, two by two, in chambers	419.59211369678746
prepared for the purpose. Before entering his closet the king desired	329.6548660431538
to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived.	428.9975830060826
Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were	491.86043127624015
heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as	318.0701319048995
they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to	322.98437805249523
receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and	407.62595150735996
it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary.	477.751952809416
At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that	349.93361057437835
time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal	401.1385074512486
appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed	486.10549254980936
upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his	472.16920860000266
lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs.	474.27576110702734
The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the	439.8000178685987
city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at	399.24454848022174
once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the	334.43733730861084
hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was	437.94263225771374
very pale.	457.77532844448314
The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons	328.38185627293916
of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an	355.5983504619722
altered voice said, “Why, madame, have you not thought proper to wear	473.87315089682966
your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much	479.0663426557983
gratification?”	392.112030899409
The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a	334.3128216099758
diabolical smile on his countenance.	426.8704408551123
“Sire,” replied the queen, with a faltering voice, “because, in the	292.98874326856577
midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to	441.58957260246825
them.”	479.0127409624489
“And you were wrong, madame. If I made you that present it was that you	391.7450603304106
might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.”	348.3764390889942
The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and	312.72059876127696
listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed.	454.65821648458416
“Sire,” said the queen, “I can send for them to the Louvre, where they	350.29443118197554
are, and thus your Majesty’s wishes will be complied with.”	403.67637999319476
“Do so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet	296.3218658473962
will commence.”	437.9949236463713
The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were	322.2250315226923
to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his	402.3267060254393
apartment.	298.2448279348332
There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody	325.9306421655796
had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but	350.2084247957547
both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew	293.0691884849414
several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to	355.52221762411125
sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.	441.1243909130019
The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting	477.6652084694448
costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This	431.72653916531453
was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really	344.24164682240007
appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom.	341.7050592188036
The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small	481.74249007847595
casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs.	417.2783852514532
“What does this mean?” demanded he of the cardinal.	472.7244686778653
“Nothing,” replied the latter; “only, if the queen has the studs, which	304.48701175913897
I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her	425.01970166083345
Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.”	397.07562778740055
The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had	310.5162149933797
not time to address any question to him—a cry of admiration burst from	380.0256422212158
every mouth. If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his	374.69723740357307
kingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in	394.8272652489484
France.	469.008530804691
It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably. She wore	370.7696160848431
a beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet,	317.07959678333526
fastened with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin,	395.0949423460089
embroidered with silver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond	321.86191889977255
studs, on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat.	395.20881688377517
The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although,	442.528270833449
distant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs.	313.2802116861844
The queen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve?	391.95976124764
At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king	428.71843933203706
advanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and	303.8818180552008
his Highness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the	295.9119468893866
ballet began.	462.20835262204895
The king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he	422.78366779434515
devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the	363.5259734025041
number. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal.	390.08516529637996
The ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen _entrées_. The ballet ended	346.470240704272
amid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his	475.53280099519526
lady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had	330.2474951896938
of leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen.	418.4207006651095
“I thank you, madame,” said he, “for the deference you have shown to my	297.8732382865419
wishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to	334.9702630078567
you.”	421.717025511255
With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal	378.5619053561677
had given him.	454.4128513368653
“How, sire?” cried the young queen, affecting surprise, “you are giving	379.75534347963304
me, then, two more: I shall have fourteen.”	408.7073532493392
In fact the king counted them, and the twelve studs were all on her	437.30286502991225
Majesty’s shoulder.	377.685824855451
The king called the cardinal.	480.58962556880203
“What does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal?” asked the king in a severe	304.03814745183007
tone.	294.73761478366043
“This means, sire,” replied the cardinal, “that I was desirous of	311.3758877730169
presenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to	485.9493296433291
offer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept	301.4230997738011
them.”	380.37320750705857
“And I am the more grateful to your Eminence,” replied Anne of Austria,	311.7396431240831
with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious	315.36980779232954
gallantry, “from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you	322.16752872365123
as much as all the others cost his Majesty.”	412.31691179786424
Then saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to	455.07774377328917
the chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her	456.1390839057043
costume.	453.57505502244277
The attention which we have been obliged to give, during the	301.3717367893485
commencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have	319.82712116451773
introduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom	345.48041162571536
Anne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over	325.39229479099555
the cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered	449.30447314702224
at one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to	296.4285585185712
four persons—the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself.	312.71372688145556
The queen had just regained her chamber, and D’Artagnan was about to	355.48880494694527
retire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched. He turned and saw a	451.400614051611
young woman, who made him a sign to follow her. The face of this young	442.08929755391864
woman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this	370.0312460689919
precaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against	314.20813399971144
him, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent	464.30702015883264
Mme. Bonacieux.	296.99458281029035
On the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment	371.43661037269345
at the apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither D’Artagnan had	299.81986508733365
sent for her. The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the	424.3510443608018
queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented	388.4207821961183
the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words. D’Artagnan	397.9554947419826
therefore followed Mme. Bonacieux moved by a double sentiment—love and	295.70832415831563
curiosity. All the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more	306.55138719178603
deserted, D’Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze	462.6814117993026
upon her, were it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided	367.6110965404445
between his hands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger	485.53875084607876
placed upon her mouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace,	304.2519292357339
reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must	296.61447451134
blindly obey, and which forbade him even to make the slightest	424.14175971883884
complaint. At length, after winding about for a minute or two, Mme.	451.73560192393063
Bonacieux opened the door of a closet, which was entirely dark, and led	339.6722966591161
D’Artagnan into it. There she made a fresh sign of silence, and opened	486.98804243007305
a second door concealed by tapestry. The opening of this door disclosed	345.003185593271
a brilliant light, and she disappeared.	469.1331835602791
D’Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he	402.2069309608131
could be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber,	300.2030725582427
together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same	331.0603532592104
aperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once	467.05935105723944
respectful and refined, and the word “Majesty” several times repeated,	337.83051289703945
indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen’s	425.95438626607034
apartment. The young man waited in comparative darkness and listened.	357.58503392594
The queen appeared cheerful and happy, which seemed to astonish the	351.1104169691483
persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost	457.82768993778956
always sad and full of care. The queen attributed this joyous feeling	346.3547500762791
to the beauty of the fête, to the pleasure she had experienced in the	336.6954679888557
ballet; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen, whether she	341.3624421122244
smile or weep, everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of	399.57702026425534
the city of Paris.	385.16142529196213
Although D’Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon	393.74470188307527
distinguished her voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign	430.20129068624806
accent, and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon	331.7739174596144
all royal words. He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially	369.939666056717
open door; and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person	444.057278434326
intercept the light.	411.19362903303033
At length a hand and an arm, surpassingly beautiful in their form and	441.7676769083498
whiteness, glided through the tapestry. D’Artagnan at once comprehended	483.0405557814853
that this was his recompense. He cast himself on his knees, seized the	351.0906371837101
hand, and touched it respectfully with his lips. Then the hand was	461.434349964504
withdrawn, leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring.	341.3002274251343
The door immediately closed, and D’Artagnan found himself again in	440.46624519645513
complete obscurity.	315.36957564953116
D’Artagnan placed the ring on his finger, and again waited; it was	312.0736600035733
evident that all was not yet over. After the reward of his devotion,	462.5980926723526
that of his love was to come. Besides, although the ballet was danced,	463.283334820689
the evening had scarcely begun. Supper was to be served at three, and	366.38166527966496
the clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two.	345.82847823760756
The sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber. The	459.77297230102243
company was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which	338.9346349424764
D’Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme. Bonacieux entered.	402.1567140398535
“You at last?” cried D’Artagnan.	399.1034864952741
“Silence!” said the young woman, placing her hand upon his lips;	365.7934359119055
“silence, and go the same way you came!”	384.78217420043364
“But where and when shall I see you again?” cried D’Artagnan.	300.10573851661144
“A note which you will find at home will tell you. Begone, begone!”	293.01699404881515
At these words she opened the door of the corridor, and pushed	412.8243210586594
D’Artagnan out of the room. D’Artagnan obeyed like a child, without the	447.8712091691491
least resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love.	338.13522448436106
Chapter XXIII.	353.55117555779543
THE RENDEZVOUS	473.1891671501638
D’Artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three o’clock in	409.2212108422571
the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse,	467.70062319214276
he met with no misadventure. Everyone knows that drunkards and lovers	304.7852463386099
have a protecting deity.	460.4072413851113
He found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked	414.807943968658
softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. Planchet*,	339.7897337463408
whom he had sent home two hours before from the Hôtel de Ville, telling	464.7407398527952
him to sit up for him, opened the door for him.	367.8194498811522
* The reader may ask, “How came Planchet here?” when he was left “stiff	433.36998118028527
as a rush” in London. In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent	440.36325177039896
him to Paris, as he did the horses.	479.2483107091122
“Has anyone brought a letter for me?” asked D’Artagnan, eagerly.	471.7774727431405
“No one has _brought_ a letter, monsieur,” replied Planchet; “but one	404.26386705632433
has come of itself.”	479.6821191241414
“What do you mean, blockhead?”	328.1691343859637
“I mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your	360.1833867751758
apartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a	486.7255591329875
letter on the green table cover in your bedroom.”	387.4473436392978
“And where is that letter?”	417.02671841251623
“I left it where I found it, monsieur. It is not natural for letters to	371.2179120480033
enter people’s houses in this manner. If the window had been open or	432.21320686785714
even ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no—all was hermetically	306.00931885983476
sealed. Beware, monsieur; there is certainly some magic underneath.”	434.1232312124821
Meanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the	295.33578939311917
letter. It was from Mme. Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:	466.5822279082452
“There are many thanks to be offered to you, and to be transmitted to	476.7054987957978
you. Be this evening about ten o’clock at St. Cloud, in front of the	371.0113975870911
pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of M. d’Estrées.—C.B.”	389.13517045580056
While reading this letter, D’Artagnan felt his heart dilated and	428.9475859071024
compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the	447.69614049249526
hearts of lovers.	480.32384440097246
It was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous	369.75005967070956
that had been granted him. His heart, swelled by the intoxication of	445.58502639069627
joy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial	396.1427381213547
paradise called Love!	483.72881284895595
“Well, monsieur,” said Planchet, who had observed his master grow red	360.8344438938901
and pale successively, “did I not guess truly? Is it not some bad	434.98988233351207
affair?”	424.21912623787347
“You are mistaken, Planchet,” replied D’Artagnan; “and as a proof,	366.7451369124504
there is a crown to drink my health.”	317.8963035172791
“I am much obliged to Monsieur for the crown he has given me, and I	391.2850175628522
promise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less	374.0841717210199
true that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses—”	349.8976305165596
“Fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven.”	401.1052999858309
“Then Monsieur is satisfied?” asked Planchet.	321.368739579288
“My dear Planchet, I am the happiest of men!”	491.9734039812075
“And I may profit by Monsieur’s happiness, and go to bed?”	466.3138664463949
“Yes, go.”	478.4221214623044
“May the blessings of heaven fall upon Monsieur! But it is not the less	349.7501985546478
true that that letter—”	440.2854910853373
And Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the	480.09910297752134
liberality of D’Artagnan had not entirely effaced.	465.53578904051835
Left alone, D’Artagnan read and reread his billet. Then he kissed and	466.3302985313227
rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful	350.51626596940423
mistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.	321.2427037221367
At seven o’clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at	429.7827654562384
the second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed	340.3370567755007
from the anxiety of the preceding night.	399.90723649733013
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, “I am going out for all day, perhaps. You	395.30921214536323
are, therefore, your own master till seven o’clock in the evening; but	314.7533536685875
at seven o’clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses.”	356.69583996764425
“There!” said Planchet. “We are going again, it appears, to have our	311.76232261035517
hides pierced in all sorts of ways.”	441.8105654186031
“You will take your musketoon and your pistols.”	433.2867730920811
“There, now! Didn’t I say so?” cried Planchet. “I was sure of it—the	417.22554641799604
cursed letter!”	397.3927162498499
“Don’t be afraid, you idiot; there is nothing in hand but a party of	381.2435543379818
pleasure.”	399.32133761022413
“Ah, like the charming journey the other day, when it rained bullets	326.7135269860737
and produced a crop of steel traps!”	469.1525519788763
“Well, if you are really afraid, Monsieur Planchet,” resumed	318.85184666435265
D’Artagnan, “I will go without you. I prefer traveling alone to having	334.4344928388383
a companion who entertains the least fear.”	475.02081587518796
“Monsieur does me wrong,” said Planchet; “I thought he had seen me at	484.4932325579447
work.”	354.92437408776254
“Yes, but I thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first	379.77181600793045
time.”	471.78337839662555
“Monsieur shall see that upon occasion I have some left; only I beg	485.4817311643318
Monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long.”	428.6800459959434
“Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this	350.88536757582125
evening?”	315.51133464887334
“I hope so, monsieur.”	396.61645925715237
“Well, then, I count on you.”	425.0308065709274
“At the appointed hour I shall be ready; only I believed that Monsieur	437.08020022511175
had but one horse in the Guard stables.”	294.24068272724696
“Perhaps there is but one at this moment; but by this evening there	350.27363326592433
will be four.”	472.7807811201508
“It appears that our journey was a remounting journey, then?”	468.89099856803466
“Exactly so,” said D’Artagnan; and nodding to Planchet, he went out.	411.60144942142483
M. Bonacieux was at his door. D’Artagnan’s intention was to go out	420.59899842671035
without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite	468.65069982021686
and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to	400.8725179470284
stop, but to enter into conversation with him.	483.345100763833
Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a	340.78872523897206
husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same	309.33903545742385
evening at St. Cloud, opposite D’Estrées’s pavilion? D’Artagnan	387.1509069494052
approached him with the most amiable air he could assume.	320.8511593991917
The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man.	408.96309852484325
M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that D’Artagnan had overheard his	384.44386197561585
conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant	304.21419568735496
the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased	326.7286118389639
to designate, during his account, by the title of the “cardinal’s	387.1279924672722
executioner,” and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the	306.07973211165796
bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of	430.0330506340518
torture.	485.12851951260257
D’Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had	401.1581586734719
finished said, “And Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her	329.4525513926422
off?—For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the	307.2686215612271
good fortune of having made your acquaintance.”	370.44278302648996
“Ah!” said Bonacieux, “they took good care not to tell me that; and my	327.36703340208214
wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that’s sacred that she does	435.61928659520237
not know. But you,” continued M. Bonacieux, in a tone of perfect good	461.63700431167126
fellowship, “what has become of you all these days? I have not seen you	386.57951797401245
nor your friends, and I don’t think you could gather all that dust that	432.89900450224064
I saw Planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of	295.96709438538693
Paris.”	375.3544901946309
“You are right, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, my friends and I have been	390.3641581879635
on a little journey.”	480.47106476804777
“Far from here?”	305.124681050181
“Oh, Lord, no! About forty leagues only. We went to take Monsieur Athos	300.9688027906114
to the waters of Forges, where my friends still remain.”	472.6807958281226
“And you have returned, have you not?” replied M. Bonacieux, giving to	457.9165802957957
his countenance a most sly air. “A handsome young fellow like you does	398.83195684805867
not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress; and we were	363.92032900106983
impatiently waited for at Paris, were we not?”	461.7076425320697
“My faith!” said the young man, laughing, “I confess it, and so much	382.9178571984535
more the readily, my dear Bonacieux, as I see there is no concealing	400.80783291123834
anything from you. Yes, I was expected, and very impatiently, I	441.822540286513
acknowledge.”	431.00585748392155
A slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux, but so slight that	333.2126041212962
D’Artagnan did not perceive it.	343.6059992963951
“And we are going to be recompensed for our diligence?” continued the	384.43008432243613
mercer, with a trifling alteration in his voice—so trifling, indeed,	416.23083304374904
that D’Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary	420.5099186709956
shade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the	340.092789369397
worthy man.	375.17389548860683
“Ah, may you be a true prophet!” said D’Artagnan, laughing.	467.1833799576278
“No; what I say,” replied Bonacieux, “is only that I may know whether I	312.05582373322164
am delaying you.”	459.8234430274082
“Why that question, my dear host?” asked D’Artagnan. “Do you intend to	441.91272103813117
sit up for me?”	435.07501637943466
“No; but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my	407.0597669315318
house, I am alarmed every time I hear a door open, particularly in the	408.6970824848849
night. What the deuce can you expect? I am no swordsman.”	489.0512261097331
“Well, don’t be alarmed if I return at one, two or three o’clock in the	352.90037587533885
morning; indeed, do not be alarmed if I do not come at all.”	300.6515769620504
This time Bonacieux became so pale that D’Artagnan could not help	442.8639320343645
perceiving it, and asked him what was the matter.	323.0725440912775
“Nothing,” replied Bonacieux, “nothing. Since my misfortunes I have	361.79207330221607
been subject to faintnesses, which seize me all at once, and I have	396.7004400360117
just felt a cold shiver. Pay no attention to it; you have nothing to	407.40450370051207
occupy yourself with but being happy.”	379.2066416875128
“Then I have full occupation, for I am so.”	488.7076931461705
“Not yet; wait a little! This evening, you said.”	393.72783907096124
“Well, this evening will come, thank God! And perhaps you look for it	296.14113416602584
with as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux	330.9119923727345
will visit the conjugal domicile.”	319.00186809919137
“Madame Bonacieux is not at liberty this evening,” replied the husband,	480.9699531675152
seriously; “she is detained at the Louvre this evening by her duties.”	342.2546593142603
“So much the worse for you, my dear host, so much the worse! When I am	338.48283348086295
happy, I wish all the world to be so; but it appears that is not	430.88874924871095
possible.”	444.5212628074764
The young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone	344.6863261145835
could comprehend.	308.610635215987
“Amuse yourself well!” replied Bonacieux, in a sepulchral tone.	323.3278778096878
But D’Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in	336.957712860988
the disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have	293.384324823887
remarked it.	343.0459170265314
He took his way toward the hôtel of M. de Tréville; his visit of the	366.8638769612804
day before, it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little	372.3293589311627
explicative.	480.9768821798838
He found Tréville in a joyful mood. He had thought the king and queen	395.3962611164478
charming at the ball. It is true the cardinal had been particularly	424.3523030221614
ill-tempered. He had retired at one o’clock under the pretense of being	395.37538012244096
indisposed. As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre	337.96609632407166
till six o’clock in the morning.	350.95433436617475
“Now,” said Tréville, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner	341.10855130960795
of the apartment to see if they were alone, “now let us talk about	328.92517770030304
yourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has	444.410865368058
something to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and	299.06294505055024
the humiliation of his Eminence. You must look out for yourself.”	308.0101206479836
“What have I to fear,” replied D’Artagnan, “as long as I shall have the	490.16529861272966
luck to enjoy the favor of their Majesties?”	445.05961399755654
“Everything, believe me. The cardinal is not the man to forget a	295.39387135723507
mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier; and the	326.5246465784497
mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young Gascon	328.4657770739557
of my acquaintance.”	398.38156605471625
“Do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself, and	379.3805337951395
knows that I have been to London?”	299.30364135544744
“The devil! You have been to London! Was it from London you brought	478.1065854938912
that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger? Beware, my dear	374.4835557059964
D’Artagnan! A present from an enemy is not a good thing. Are there not	388.5298369025093
some Latin verses upon that subject? Stop!”	350.1241630534879
“Yes, doubtless,” replied D’Artagnan, who had never been able to cram	388.54001878685455
the first rudiments of that language into his head, and who had by his	464.049423900908
ignorance driven his master to despair, “yes, doubtless there is one.”	375.4624250473755
“There certainly is one,” said M. de Tréville, who had a tincture of	474.5983049940859
literature, “and Monsieur de Benserade was quoting it to me the other	481.40003107555606
day. Stop a minute—ah, this is it: ‘Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,’	304.01700818553184
which means, ‘Beware of the enemy who makes you presents.”	333.3614462137062
“This diamond does not come from an enemy, monsieur,” replied	430.32805830265323
D’Artagnan, “it comes from the queen.”	328.3017132486386
“From the queen! Oh, oh!” said M. de Tréville. “Why, it is indeed a	416.3418508943802
true royal jewel, which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a	395.497886882119
denier. By whom did the queen send you this jewel?”	311.14431764198366
“She gave it to me herself.”	394.3058630062298
“Where?”	429.187196805369
“In the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet.”	335.59062524409353
“How?”	448.53617657418505
“Giving me her hand to kiss.”	458.5632933139402
“You have kissed the queen’s hand?” said M. de Tréville, looking	329.6085057355972
earnestly at D’Artagnan.	360.6933794271704
“Her Majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor.”	316.0117856590813
“And that in the presence of witnesses! Imprudent, thrice imprudent!”	328.9854866329785
“No, monsieur, be satisfied; nobody saw her,” replied D’Artagnan, and	470.8610617796064
he related to M. de Tréville how the affair came to pass.	400.6193440109106
“Oh, the women, the women!” cried the old soldier. “I know them by	465.17940007680704
their romantic imagination. Everything that savors of mystery charms	394.6237257489646
them. So you have seen the arm, that was all. You would meet the queen,	396.15536525019843
and she would not know who you are?”	377.3454823707191
“No; but thanks to this diamond,” replied the young man.	372.3868985803451
“Listen,” said M. de Tréville; “shall I give you counsel, good counsel,	479.1049827422071
the counsel of a friend?”	445.7543640098181
“You will do me honor, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan.	425.3869144476681
“Well, then, off to the nearest goldsmith’s, and sell that diamond for	361.2912592912992
the highest price you can get from him. However much of a Jew he may	419.32184654924504
be, he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no	343.7087906098069
name, young man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him	474.91351707672607
who wears it.”	334.68148580192
“Sell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign? Never!” said	472.10860791385767
D’Artagnan.	332.4468201002539
“Then, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody	452.9212599092441
must be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in	386.2616361427167
his mother’s jewel case.”	435.66767585647176
“You think, then, I have something to dread?” asked D’Artagnan.	486.46692621247075
“I mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine the match of	490.0426867991704
which is already lighted, may consider himself in safety in comparison	409.6891517851045
with you.”	313.9216069823445
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, whom the positive tone of M. de Tréville	328.11000408494823
began to disquiet, “the devil! What must I do?”	298.900352755206
“Above all things be always on your guard. The cardinal has a tenacious	443.8471698212561
memory and a long arm; you may depend upon it, he will repay you by	391.66117493148454
some ill turn.”	402.1394367315637
“But of what sort?”	360.38199290066694
“Eh! How can I tell? Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his	423.8486473671694
command? The least that can be expected is that you will be arrested.”	462.8440266577427
“What! Will they dare to arrest a man in his Majesty’s service?”	408.0220633151231
“_Pardieu!_ They did not scruple much in the case of Athos. At all	424.7732047115958
events, young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do	457.8636184275698
not lull yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the	321.3470202679974
contrary—and it is I who say it—see enemies in all directions. If	307.58585874728175
anyone seeks a quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten	322.88238908720336
years old. If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat,	463.7490908459034
without shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your	383.39047080864214
foot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house	354.81068195005605
which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your	429.88766857631117
head; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let	326.99006867078845
your lackey be armed—if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey.	362.4029458671474
Mistrust everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress—your	400.2686674462622
mistress above all.”	342.4512142635942
D’Artagnan blushed.	397.85561320629483
“My mistress above all,” repeated he, mechanically; “and why her rather	399.27388803880666
than another?”	451.924490167921
“Because a mistress is one of the cardinal’s favorite means; he has not	339.2651329515324
one that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles,	471.77054540252544
witness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?”	332.42704162350947
D’Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme. Bonacieux had made with him	366.4617606877597
for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our	450.73028585648126
hero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Tréville of women in	423.66059570861273
general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty	335.09496629378884
hostess.	363.94800372063776
“But, _à propos_,” resumed M. de Tréville, “what has become of your	366.98429542384747
three companions?”	463.84572639247733
“I was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?”	330.42982056653625
“None, monsieur.”	422.06778979412513
“Well, I left them on my road—Porthos at Chantilly, with a duel on his	476.4982628604489
hands; Aramis at Crèvecœur, with a ball in his shoulder; and Athos at	353.3060047939218
Amiens, detained by an accusation of coining.”	466.2253546187105
“See there, now!” said M. de Tréville; “and how the devil did you	401.80132292340386
escape?”	424.6436018078644
“By a miracle, monsieur, I must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my	440.1219730223644
breast, and by nailing the Comte de Wardes on the byroad to Calais,	480.9658687340807
like a butterfly on a tapestry.”	451.28661078426336
“There again! De Wardes, one of the cardinal’s men, a cousin of	323.5108020045699
Rochefort! Stop, my friend, I have an idea.”	468.5876376123208
“Speak, monsieur.”	392.44315912474383
“In your place, I would do one thing.”	415.7444558202692
“What?”	458.3442789889132
“While his Eminence was seeking for me in Paris, I would take, without	363.4169570716472
sound of drum or trumpet, the road to Picardy, and would go and make	300.6892965228276
some inquiries concerning my three companions. What the devil! They	450.97276162266905
merit richly that piece of attention on your part.”	463.02991929231655
“The advice is good, monsieur, and tomorrow I will set out.”	441.28378210356675
“Tomorrow! Any why not this evening?”	411.4706366032019
“This evening, monsieur, I am detained in Paris by indispensable	372.10685036039547
business.”	375.1455171684585
“Ah, young man, young man, some flirtation or other. Take care, I	376.8025571335085
repeat to you, take care. It is woman who has ruined us, still ruins	474.7142182982418
us, and will ruin us, as long as the world stands. Take my advice and	364.663905786447
set out this evening.”	320.15716698329436
“Impossible, monsieur.”	320.7796357935425
“You have given your word, then?”	401.4378712776676
“Yes, monsieur.”	308.3334428061117
“Ah, that’s quite another thing; but promise me, if you should not be	406.921044151315
killed tonight, that you will go tomorrow.”	353.0327639991067
“I promise it.”	416.7736873842768
“Do you need money?”	334.1727043557932
“I have still fifty pistoles. That, I think, is as much as I shall	442.7018335515693
want.”	470.9094210547176
“But your companions?”	367.2110012474022
“I don’t think they can be in need of any. We left Paris, each with	403.0389538520652
seventy-five pistoles in his pocket.”	398.84108546967656
“Shall I see you again before your departure?”	356.62255818931567
“I think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen.”	344.38354720322184
“Well, a pleasant journey.”	332.2050087791716
“Thanks, monsieur.”	487.42656149931804
D’Artagnan left M. de Tréville, touched more than ever by his paternal	398.361360736174
solicitude for his Musketeers.	482.33795174681825
He called successively at the abodes of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.	443.1718734170911
Neither of them had returned. Their lackeys likewise were absent, and	293.93043162916416
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. He would have	371.5685300933909
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted	318.44723752299785
with Porthos’s nor Aramis’s, and as to Athos, he had none.	299.3641623038571
As he passed the Hôtel des Gardes, he took a glance into the stables.	403.3166133947914
Three of the four horses had already arrived. Planchet, all	463.62903920463714
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.	421.8672596658358
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, on perceiving D’Artagnan, “how glad I am	449.57562389231913
to see you.”	355.5534658017318
“Why so, Planchet?” asked the young man.	478.8439348375915
“Do you place confidence in our landlord—Monsieur Bonacieux?”	326.2086427046424
“I? Not the least in the world.”	331.4530598066962
“Oh, you do quite right, monsieur.”	376.46086782673393
“But why this question?”	465.15586936948085
“Because, while you were talking with him, I watched you without	317.01662854494816
listening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or	452.2655663024623
three times!”	337.19182907969844
“Bah!”	471.9358201054366
“Preoccupied as Monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did	410.8258939694422
not observe that; but I, whom the strange fashion in which that letter	448.21630747561926
came into the house had placed on my guard—I did not lose a movement of	408.08041363239954
his features.”	440.5108855440808
“And you found it?”	404.281950649289
“Traitorous, monsieur.”	465.1577291276168
“Indeed!”	293.6181107120974
“Still more; as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the	486.29557494173474
corner of the street, Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat, shut his door,	488.65370870555046
and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction.”	367.335268453281
“It seems you are right, Planchet; all this appears to be a little	382.2089191852415
mysterious; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the	374.05672118855074
matter shall be categorically explained to us.”	307.12134215290115
“Monsieur jests, but Monsieur will see.”	407.1980133691044
“What would you have, Planchet? What must come is written.”	416.393897532875
“Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?”	296.46605040090304
“Quite the contrary, Planchet; the more ill will I have toward Monsieur	297.1161900207455
Bonacieux, the more punctual I shall be in keeping the appointment made	417.8249041955748
by that letter which makes you so uneasy.”	383.5934153080127
“Then that is Monsieur’s determination?”	442.738866270435
“Undeniably, my friend. At nine o’clock, then, be ready here at the	311.08481622883806
hôtel, I will come and take you.”	346.57851717419544
Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master	483.06368745197926
renounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom	487.52018882209836
the third horse.	420.1001952633661
As to D’Artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning	419.80173437598455
home, went and dined with the Gascon priest, who, at the time of the	475.74368938788183
distress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.	469.4341356255478
Chapter XXIV.	315.1644250560194
THE PAVILION	379.69158164012174
At nine o’clock D’Artagnan was at the Hôtel des Gardes; he found	383.4354062654891
Planchet all ready. The fourth horse had arrived.	403.50646872868487
Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. D’Artagnan had his	327.5299887056839
sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and	323.574275935544
departed quietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out.	313.43806615762657
Planchet took place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten	328.6278367505287
paces from him.	414.9775007486271
D’Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of La Conférence and	437.64315709224127
followed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads	301.6317699540827
to St. Cloud.	451.6946732322875
As long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance	379.46789082529006
he had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more	474.16055916753953
lonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the	396.8037129424772
Bois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side	461.9461653808513
with his master. In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of	335.87832829652143
the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood	305.50043972063844
gave him serious uneasiness. D’Artagnan could not help perceiving that	309.41410519541364
something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and	488.71098789453333
said, “Well, Monsieur Planchet, what is the matter with us now?”	363.01030359721665
“Don’t you think, monsieur, that woods are like churches?”	295.36296681172445
“How so, Planchet?”	445.81015600238095
“Because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other.”	303.49733417938637
“But why did you not dare to speak aloud, Planchet—because you are	459.6141795629121
afraid?”	357.66460447950783
“Afraid of being heard? Yes, monsieur.”	321.2818541945365
“Afraid of being heard! Why, there is nothing improper in our	481.9064239490741
conversation, my dear Planchet, and no one could find fault with it.”	394.7521699755348
“Ah, monsieur!” replied Planchet, recurring to his besetting idea,	359.4952594322306
“that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and	335.4409979814347
something very unpleasant in the play of his lips.”	344.3634608080785
“What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux?”	440.34922642362653
“Monsieur, we think of what we can, and not of what we will.”	300.3838969258972
“Because you are a coward, Planchet.”	367.61804324530124
“Monsieur, we must not confound prudence with cowardice; prudence is a	323.05572017384486
virtue.”	314.50839694756075
“And you are very virtuous, are you not, Planchet?”	392.56194994208545
“Monsieur, is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder?	446.87503536847964
Had we not better lower our heads?”	379.2762709891282
“In truth,” murmured D’Artagnan, to whom M. de Tréville’s	400.9826106977063
recommendation recurred, “this animal will end by making me afraid.”	389.4726219923317
And he put his horse into a trot.	463.4751166284482
Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his	489.9680968143134
shadow, and was soon trotting by his side.	396.93853078978157
“Are we going to continue this pace all night?” asked Planchet.	416.50384035479243
“No; you are at your journey’s end.”	391.42598892558885
“How, monsieur! And you?”	351.7934529846366
“I am going a few steps farther.”	312.9502160778611
“And Monsieur leaves me here alone?”	389.3784929581298
“You are afraid, Planchet?”	466.64605870341893
“No; I only beg leave to observe to Monsieur that the night will be	351.1761240800877
very cold, that chills bring on rheumatism, and that a lackey who has	294.9951484885477
the rheumatism makes but a poor servant, particularly to a master as	467.6117826349664
active as Monsieur.”	338.7213693083024
“Well, if you are cold, Planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets	398.40881086371155
that you see yonder, and be in waiting for me at the door by six	366.1607315108977
o’clock in the morning.”	410.9489087989655
“Monsieur, I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me	453.0477090478879
this morning, so that I have not a sou left in case I should be cold.”	491.30834002753704
“Here’s half a pistole. Tomorrow morning.”	461.98272293559114
D’Artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Planchet, and	487.43424366487955
departed at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him.	468.3169867587687
“Good Lord, how cold I am!” cried Planchet, as soon as he had lost	419.9986600131145
sight of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he	431.2122524248597
went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban	446.4804370685182
tavern, and knocked at the door.	335.74035823326545
In the meantime D’Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued	346.79978047990835
his route and reached St. Cloud; but instead of following the main	491.3318690417798
street he turned behind the château, reached a sort of retired lane,	326.64104637091623
and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named. It was situated	334.24223968321456
in a very private spot. A high wall, at the angle of which was the	396.4303904302632
pavilion, ran along one side of this lane, and on the other was a	343.5031900597328
little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a	352.81244909561946
hedge from passers-by.	335.448893477757
He gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by	403.4681601328715
which to announce his presence, he waited.	358.6590935447374
Not the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined that he was a	372.4938644028241
hundred miles from the capital. D’Artagnan leaned against the hedge,	447.40172883078833
after having cast a glance behind it. Beyond that hedge, that garden,	361.6811413227531
and that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity	400.49051422725955
where Paris slept—a vast void from which glittered a few luminous	397.0492788683351
points, the funeral stars of that hell!	318.06636126239084
But for D’Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore a	473.87214294563273
smile, all shades were diaphanous. The appointed hour was about to	390.38689058642296
strike. In fact, at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St. Cloud	470.98284173419984
let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws. There was something	428.3913134504667
melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the	465.51151865151246
middle of the night; but each of those strokes, which made up the	335.8431561517477
expected hour, vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man.	338.00530944244537
His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of	308.3835874749724
the wall, of which all the windows were closed with shutters, except	299.35624672630405
one on the first story. Through this window shone a mild light which	310.5107862234144
silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group	332.02950017280205
outside the park. There could be no doubt that behind this little	404.42962495912104
window, which threw forth such friendly beams, the pretty Mme.	491.4253930724035
Bonacieux expected him.	398.5281984704796
Wrapped in this sweet idea, D’Artagnan waited half an hour without the	346.23056090237407
least impatience, his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of	482.40868014231273
which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings,	330.4756561236148
attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment.	303.035444841309
The belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten.	300.3187436713385
This time, without knowing why, D’Artagnan felt a cold shiver run	330.7666808046211
through his veins. Perhaps the cold began to affect him, and he took a	386.55387370309404
perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression.	433.5694521979194
Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, and that the	407.3350685203379
appointment was for eleven o’clock. He drew near to the window, and	298.8121390232098
placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as	306.76008194608147
he held it, he drew it from his pocket and read it again; but he had	339.47308654538153
not been mistaken, the appointment was for ten o’clock. He went and	292.5253477829831
resumed his post, beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and	393.8769698770661
this solitude.	473.2489256150443
Eleven o’clock sounded.	363.4266900537302
D’Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme.	341.48149795119184
Bonacieux. He clapped his hands three times—the ordinary signal of	413.1841891909112
lovers; but nobody replied to him, not even an echo.	391.5764468961778
He then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman	439.26765345296656
had fallen asleep while waiting for him. He approached the wall, and	339.2786006559084
tried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and	359.1655016441596
D’Artagnan could get no hold.	464.8534036016748
At that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light	339.02803795999654
still shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought that	332.8691931179733
from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the	359.9506624335478
pavilion.	408.41777410522064
The tree was easy to climb. Besides, D’Artagnan was but twenty years	350.0415083323736
old, and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits. In an	356.05769080898864
instant he was among the branches, and his keen eyes plunged through	340.27191741939896
the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion.	392.90432680190077
It was a strange thing, and one which made D’Artagnan tremble from the	314.3603321248478
sole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft	370.3212734483529
light, this calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder. One of	368.8944657632726
the windows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and	448.09830180441736
hung, split in two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with	351.90011226626814
an elegant supper, was overturned. The decanters broken in pieces, and	363.55102287393635
the fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything in the apartment gave	422.2059634618675
evidence of a violent and desperate struggle. D’Artagnan even fancied	369.2483580789176
he could recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments,	448.51401762384796
and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He hastened	299.65952035398874
to descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he	353.6304862884093
wished to see if he could find other traces of violence.	352.9238307528918
The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night. D’Artagnan	327.32422550888134
then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked—for nothing had	324.45862668461774
led him to the examination—that the ground, trampled here and	468.06135227165646
hoofmarked there, presented confused traces of men and horses. Besides,	348.91826902443586
the wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had	489.0779494707505
made a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond	310.9964213024337
the pavilion, but turned again toward Paris.	436.3475672091739
At length D’Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a	470.61336051063756
woman’s torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy	326.99437082161785
ground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves	409.49144072773356
that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand.	423.85645792453244
As D’Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy	365.3628618921314
sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed	398.9146978781638
by a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet he	304.89702543661207
said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in	458.1429712069829
common with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an	318.5887658714822
appointment with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that	337.8056209703251
she might have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the	372.08005159796215
jealousy of her husband.	335.9527485903417
But all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that	327.9654805688322
feeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession	428.3146209826541
of our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that	439.26975367379964
some great misfortune is hanging over us.	486.65456634762995
Then D’Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took	409.7357864605906
the path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the	361.01502064516063
boatman.	432.6355170429963
About seven o’clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young	319.7031741871958
woman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not	428.1681552402795
to be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the	423.2367890143248
boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was	416.68025044578565
young and pretty.	400.15610529283083
There were then, as now, a crowd of young and pretty women who came to	292.5773889522208
St. Cloud, and who had reasons for not being seen, and yet D’Artagnan	438.40531376748663
did not for an instant doubt that it was Mme. Bonacieux whom the	408.32676018378106
boatman had noticed.	356.1136602791333
D’Artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the	340.61275007566076
ferryman to read the billet of Mme. Bonacieux once again, and satisfy	406.7935418932266
himself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St.	308.2835905548659
Cloud and not elsewhere, before the D’Estrées’s pavilion and not in	340.38293355036706
another street. Everything conspired to prove to D’Artagnan that his	356.8690219324353
presentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had	361.0855954160375
happened.	310.96963852987085
He again ran back to the château. It appeared to him that something	477.5450789636995
might have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh	404.02481237656775
information awaited him. The lane was still deserted, and the same calm	445.53550456234075
soft light shone through the window.	337.77983446751045
D’Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had	346.27407803652255
no doubt seen all, and could tell its tale. The gate of the enclosure	473.7625380966956
was shut; but he leaped over the hedge, and in spite of the barking of	365.3978481927779
a chained-up dog, went up to the cabin.	416.8048751803116
No one answered to his first knocking. A silence of death reigned in	405.26786220137853
the cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource,	306.95481759715557
he knocked again.	396.7539983359825
It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within—a timid	375.55951833703324
noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.	338.613292373856
Then D’Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full of	378.5715269495922
anxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of a	345.47790872473547
nature to reassure the most fearful. At length an old, worm-eaten	300.9228768294782
shutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as	482.1682928485531
the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone	471.9859594166844
upon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of D’Artagnan.	324.0618192706684
Nevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, D’Artagnan had had time	346.5863364038795
to get a glimpse of the head of an old man.	377.2107369754832
“In the name of heaven!” cried he, “listen to me; I have been waiting	475.0356534524493
for someone who has not come. I am dying with anxiety. Has anything	303.8029952515822
particular happened in the neighborhood? Speak!”	437.03749156843753
The window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it	475.0781095196451
was now still more pale than before.	450.02909638363303
D’Artagnan related his story simply, with the omission of names. He	394.07811765376266
told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion,	402.02918198056125
and how, not seeing her come, he had climbed the linden tree, and by	419.6718574815816
the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber.	420.8765113440978
The old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all	379.70286943357195
so; and then, when D’Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air	353.9816483634212
that announced nothing good.	460.1448206146988
“What do you mean?” cried D’Artagnan. “In the name of heaven, explain	474.14359466282355
yourself!”	323.36572005633656
“Oh! Monsieur,” said the old man, “ask me nothing; for if I dared tell	427.92866612723924
you what I have seen, certainly no good would befall me.”	377.516217479995
“You have, then, seen something?” replied D’Artagnan. “In that case, in	390.4704468967453
the name of heaven,” continued he, throwing him a pistole, “tell me	421.5842486450076
what you have seen, and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that	328.0261942816934
not one of your words shall escape from my heart.”	408.2717739097409
The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the	397.601969456446
young man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low	307.268596510436
voice: “It was scarcely nine o’clock when I heard a noise in the	297.89798675389943
street, and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door,	481.694235899347
I found that somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and	323.0362758120403
am not afraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three	420.0536238971778
men at a few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two	385.3251076702013
horses, and some saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the	477.26364125737643
three men, who were dressed as cavaliers. ‘Ah, my worthy gentlemen,’	354.2810340914761
cried I, ‘what do you want?’ ‘You must have a ladder?’ said he who	469.0031235044413
appeared to be the leader of the party. ‘Yes, monsieur, the one with	316.5214135383292
which I gather my fruit.’ ‘Lend it to us, and go into your house again;	411.13398519315876
there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you. Only remember	487.84788416729805
this—if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear (for	467.37018469989476
you will look and you will listen, I am quite sure, however we may	388.1024921287649
threaten you), you are lost.’ At these words he threw me a crown, which	404.4720576789332
I picked up, and he took the ladder. After shutting the gate behind	379.26381814146356
them, I pretended to return to the house, but I immediately went out a	295.50123358626297
back door, and stealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained	434.97002311921017
yonder clump of elder, from which I could hear and see everything. The	469.7081134906906
three men brought the carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little	355.3325951421817
man, stout, short, elderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark	386.70279626188346
color, who ascended the ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in	426.1499478312219
at the window of the pavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up,	321.30375543923594
and whispered, ‘It is she!’ Immediately, he who had spoken to me	462.44381976661623
approached the door of the pavilion, opened it with a key he had in his	373.3225200140738
hand, closed the door and disappeared, while at the same time the other	378.979113475865
two men ascended the ladder. The little old man remained at the coach	309.1388826806663
door; the coachman took care of his horses, the lackey held the	314.6272476270837
saddlehorses. All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion, and a	317.0432078169904
woman came to the window, and opened it, as if to throw herself out of	393.82882480573403
it; but as soon as she perceived the other two men, she fell back and	307.0063298236282
they went into the chamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise	392.08984030851843
of breaking furniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her	324.4153759944201
cries were soon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in	460.9293288708769
their arms, and carried her to the carriage, into which the little old	411.02547513749994
man got after her. The leader closed the window, came out an instant	370.33886997970234
after by the door, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the	465.5306184725278
carriage. His two companions were already on horseback. He sprang into	389.447947511395
his saddle; the lackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage	474.2969329475246
went off at a quick pace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was	361.9935612237924
over. From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything.”	409.43420504658263
D’Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained	333.11477543616076
motionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were	329.9628623175012
howling in his heart.	421.45330730785463
“But, my good gentleman,” resumed the old man, upon whom this mute	427.23867922644433
despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would	323.28693205333315
have done, “do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that’s a	389.07224318368503
comfort.”	297.9061350451937
“Can you guess,” said D’Artagnan, “who was the man who headed this	322.9460669525029
infernal expedition?”	379.4272306348243
“I don’t know him.”	419.7712660719818
“But as you spoke to him you must have seen him.”	325.5026086905428
“Oh, it’s a description you want?”	428.49138692350516
“Exactly so.”	317.42792953326705
“A tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a	368.13460321560007
gentleman.”	298.03742531744945
“That’s the man!” cried D’Artagnan, “again he, forever he! He is my	468.91728395525433
demon, apparently. And the other?”	389.99560731057204
“Which?”	463.25550358025544
“The short one.”	394.08693024371865
“Oh, he was not a gentleman, I’ll answer for it; besides, he did not	355.77951736741795
wear a sword, and the others treated him with small consideration.”	344.7509857454529
“Some lackey,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Poor woman, poor woman, what have	307.803782937418
they done with you?”	318.49805130765776
“You have promised to be secret, my good monsieur?” said the old man.	439.74714369817923
“And I renew my promise. Be easy, I am a gentleman. A gentleman has but	339.30976098788807
his word, and I have given you mine.”	372.3414127987148
With a heavy heart, D’Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry.	425.11464695387485
Sometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should	296.99534856113917
find her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an	383.4692458502213
intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and	430.8482441745766
carried her off. His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.	372.080733505583
“Oh, if I had my three friends here,” cried he, “I should have, at	418.0989270685527
least, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of	371.6275553405759
them?”	322.7283079035724
It was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet. D’Artagnan	401.77071865558173
went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but	404.8922989103929
could not find Planchet in any of them.	468.3383712139354
At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.	426.17519843247123
D’Artagnan had appointed six o’clock in the morning for his lackey, and	320.44346456257836
wherever he might be, he was right.	389.84991462775645
Besides, it came into the young man’s mind that by remaining in the	304.40853495169085
environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would,	416.1885071979832
perhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair. At the	465.6486235202759
sixth cabaret, then, as we said, D’Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle	419.8595514282389
of wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner	438.5203399739837
of the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again	339.7754050177918
his hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his	474.8420516756607
ears, he heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which	459.19376827302676
passed between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the	361.0496549462927
honorable society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon	440.7376860466542
the least track of her who had been stolen from him. He was compelled,	467.1156120705629
then, after having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the	440.65393753374974
time as well as to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position	431.6217521754878
in his corner and to sleep, whether well or ill. D’Artagnan, be it	439.58442407671305
remembered, was only twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its	308.3809296596778
imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon, even with the	488.9582371818036
saddest hearts.	488.8700307090563
Toward six o’clock D’Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling	350.28993241906363
which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was	434.1095303186437
not long in making his toilet. He examined himself to see if advantage	380.2684456591518
had been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his	293.0528466159229
finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,	378.96296356218403
paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better	381.7606688319316
luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.	429.47151834988455
The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest	430.30449872122824
Planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of	308.23986878281045
a little blind cabaret, before which D’Artagnan had passed without even	404.3783885721978
a suspicion of its existence.	447.67145448798556
Chapter XXV.	461.1826997462324
PORTHOS	336.84190151254404
Instead of returning directly home, D’Artagnan alighted at the door of	408.14866905734914
M. de Tréville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided	322.26319764788855
to relate all that had passed. M. de Tréville would doubtless give him	475.5500638895247
good advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Tréville saw the	347.3607076584446
queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some	474.9103830063276
intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making	423.4638053137785
pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.	473.02740446715586
M. de Tréville listened to the young man’s account with a seriousness	427.44329183499633
which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a	415.168880720019
love affair. When D’Artagnan had finished, he said, “Hum! All this	395.75495901149696
savors of his Eminence, a league off.”	319.15500870030087
“But what is to be done?” said D’Artagnan.	428.6480866394912
“Nothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told	380.66954896939677
you, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her	368.38760658933387
the details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no	393.5326437902989
doubt ignorant. These details will guide her on her part, and on your	325.3230833932889
return, I shall perhaps have some good news to tell you. Rely on me.”	471.6162928037853
D’Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Tréville was not in the	310.78130726047664
habit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he	448.99324031626674
more than kept his word. He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for	419.58927794674213
the past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side	413.93435004781685
felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute,	412.4344134808082
pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.	292.58997606458195
Determined to put the advice of M. de Tréville in practice instantly,	376.6064796783254
D’Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order	365.6082204006942
to superintend the packing of his valise. On approaching the house, he	445.3220192739211
perceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.	307.3897924477637
All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening	442.8660888539322
about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of	412.58085677708266
D’Artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done	465.29538960658704
before. In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which	487.54643845105664
indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might,	476.21074493740576
besides, be accidental, D’Artagnan remarked something perfidiously	489.7827997738765
significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance. A	357.6474346957047
rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a	460.50776983241985
hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood	307.29118220497395
is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little	475.37782825475267
attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true	465.427973383308
face.	464.2288906067972
It appeared, then, to D’Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask, and	362.4217919593633
likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon. In	443.11545037913066
consequence of this feeling of repugnance, he was about to pass without	295.8432830713886
speaking to him, but, as he had done the day before, M. Bonacieux	391.0294648944485
accosted him.	456.364483675005
“Well, young man,” said he, “we appear to pass rather gay nights! Seven	328.1031981575701
o’clock in the morning! _Peste!_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs,	407.9198377189077
and come home at the hour when other people are going out.”	369.38310232614333
“No one can reproach you for anything of the kind, Monsieur Bonacieux,”	301.3282291938384
said the young man; “you are a model for regular people. It is true	366.68104226806634
that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to	385.5919249653539
seek happiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not,	292.53658225222085
Monsieur Bonacieux?”	415.5277197210371
Bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.	337.23425083951213
“Ah, ah!” said Bonacieux, “you are a jocular companion! But where the	335.5413613646769
devil were you gadding last night, my young master? It does not appear	462.86169511918484
to be very clean in the crossroads.”	418.1277344173569
D’Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that	296.67241279148925
same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it	386.2842305841791
might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both	317.42291199203993
were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.	416.27250129347857
Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of D’Artagnan. That little stout	320.5878216216563
man, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,	345.2562694674376
treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the	306.4376450865065
escort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the	395.6551339274088
abduction of his wife.	369.3089492702901
A terrible inclination seized D’Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the	336.50632240153027
throat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent	336.2182307915075
youth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which	328.28266613385836
appeared upon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was	461.71192958197446
terrified at it, and he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as	365.56201704839805
he was standing before the half of the door which was shut, the	464.94856843941784
obstacle compelled him to keep his place.	387.69489981639083
“Ah, but you are joking, my worthy man!” said D’Artagnan. “It appears	330.74954320041155
to me that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in	387.04795440851063
equal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little	436.15918542485474
also, Monsieur Bonacieux? Oh, the devil! That’s unpardonable in a man	383.1504212718464
of your age, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours.”	331.5568423991624
“Oh, Lord! no,” said Bonacieux, “but yesterday I went to St. Mandé to	304.4879358201343
make some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without	306.57581986448986
one; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which	491.2928116611769
I have not yet had time to remove.”	445.48053686460605
The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his	341.3268310665861
journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions D’Artagnan had	403.2017061794634
conceived. Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly	354.69050254085863
opposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his	354.7623607373373
first consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by	449.20423680093757
extreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret	387.03564369265916
escape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a	312.6725788818193
certainty.	379.2757178174669
“Pardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don’t stand upon ceremony,”	317.4589539208555
said D’Artagnan, “but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. I	446.02954467804625
am parched with thirst. Allow me to take a glass of water in your	447.09571733021534
apartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors.”	444.6700884529068
Without waiting for the permission of his host, D’Artagnan went quickly	402.73561313900274
into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been	356.40196064015635
used. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or	349.9864104784876
two; he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or	462.97074545776064
else at least to the first relay.	371.7860416677827
“Thanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan, emptying his glass,	437.76743078066875
“that is all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I	428.20863506885314
will make Planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you	306.63219780968643
like, send him to you to brush your shoes.”	369.47905993675687
He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and	331.2995892270407
asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.	441.1487739308692
At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great fright.	466.91062334688394
“Ah, monsieur!” cried Planchet, as soon as he perceived his master,	305.9658843119912
“here is more trouble. I thought you would never come in.”	316.525577050183
“What’s the matter now, Planchet?” demanded D’Artagnan.	315.6278646450054
“Oh! I give you a hundred, I give you a thousand times to guess,	463.08251916619156
monsieur, the visit I received in your absence.”	385.8277176997634
“When?”	391.6560939134188
“About half an hour ago, while you were at Monsieur de Tréville’s.”	450.6126851166715
“Who has been here? Come, speak.”	439.91374679771104
“Monsieur de Cavois.”	386.2447170844836
“Monsieur de Cavois?”	387.7913784518227
“In person.”	376.3521667728675
“The captain of the cardinal’s Guards?”	404.1173137416377
“Himself.”	396.11239612880723
“Did he come to arrest me?”	452.06080651377886
“I have no doubt that he did, monsieur, for all his wheedling manner.”	471.22106684055336
“Was he so sweet, then?”	354.68805862316134
“Indeed, he was all honey, monsieur.”	476.9649136995322
“Indeed!”	424.6758394042138
“He came, he said, on the part of his Eminence, who wished you well,	475.2230824038868
and to beg you to follow him to the Palais-Royal*.”	338.08948344321004
* It was called the Palais-Cardinal before Richelieu gave it to the	442.93493856289786
King.	473.0929491452804
“What did you answer him?”	383.7628604396755
“That the thing was impossible, seeing that you were not at home, as he	467.46220194109856
could see.”	380.6771502909742
“Well, what did he say then?”	292.5799003370337
“That you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day; and	344.7524659801781
then he added in a low voice, ‘Tell your master that his Eminence is	317.8652421527609
very well disposed toward him, and that his fortune perhaps depends	305.83045595385084
upon this interview.’”	482.40569173338827
“The snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal,” replied the young	433.5641142994675
man, smiling.	358.6783005768342
“Oh, I saw the snare, and I answered you would be quite in despair on	410.64399641276697
your return.	368.8924121419875
“‘Where has he gone?’ asked Monsieur de Cavois.	446.9586507015873
“‘To Troyes, in Champagne,’ I answered.	296.5972081102718
“‘And when did he set out?’	383.1139377181567
“‘Yesterday evening.’”	445.74367940584045
“Planchet, my friend,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “you are really a	385.779574147042
precious fellow.”	443.06960446898705
“You will understand, monsieur, I thought there would be still time, if	410.446378180559
you wish, to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were	406.59389427933087
not yet gone. The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not	467.57108550274336
a gentleman, I may be allowed to lie.”	408.3879477035173
“Be of good heart, Planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a	485.4826075901331
veracious man. In a quarter of an hour we set off.”	482.1224792442449
“That’s the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we	344.70382120853947
going, may I ask, without being too curious?”	308.2806356026338
_“Pardieu!_ In the opposite direction to that which you said I was	412.81202562324336
gone. Besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of Grimaud,	319.558393451247
Mousqueton, and Bazin as I am to know what has become of Athos,	452.4931289642464
Porthos, and Aramis?”	341.2971333725959
“Yes, monsieur,” said Planchet, “and I will go as soon as you please.	411.6469795324556
Indeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than	484.68087945424264
the air of Paris. So then—”	375.7904764324941
“So then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my part,	469.6627025695893
I will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be	491.77980666183083
suspected. You may join me at the Hôtel des Gardes. By the way,	322.93795605310373
Planchet, I think you are right with respect to our host, and that he	431.1812987363452
is decidedly a frightfully low wretch.”	481.6712805209113
“Ah, monsieur, you may take my word when I tell you anything. I am a	392.2590005783463
physiognomist, I assure you.”	454.5061172584857
D’Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that	344.47333467483253
he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,	368.7800167287789
for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news	393.2970770566761
had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an	474.38983003901075
elegant writing in small characters, had come for Aramis. D’Artagnan	314.97476137605076
took charge of it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the	402.1310740886862
stables of the Hôtel des Gardes. D’Artagnan, in order that there might	310.7673399237562
be no time lost, had saddled his horse himself.	472.5593013799333
“That’s well,” said he to Planchet, when the latter added the	354.7235832677921
portmanteau to the equipment. “Now saddle the other three horses.”	351.4906552663925
“Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two	331.179248969848
horses apiece?” said Planchet, with his shrewd air.	428.8681357760029
“No, Monsieur Jester,” replied D’Artagnan; “but with our four horses we	303.3405658850912
may bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to	338.4654081261239
find them living.”	337.9265302178213
“Which is a great chance,” replied Planchet, “but we must not despair	444.79859936343746
of the mercy of God.”	377.38675683618976
“Amen!” said D’Artagnan, getting into his saddle.	341.09298925021113
As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the	335.05550828309987
street at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la	436.03808243077845
Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre, to meet again beyond	491.74427196222734
St. Denis—a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal	459.3684806077188
punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D’Artagnan	390.1167737604617
and Planchet entered Pierrefitte together.	469.9160955982185
Planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by	301.6251305869311
night. His natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single	398.2234091045216
instant. He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first	423.9525957425353
journey, and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy.	445.0545851165741
It followed that his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him	441.1886864163211
some severe reprimands from D’Artagnan, who feared that his excess of	399.7291099842387
politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no	458.2300639767607
consequence.	403.14067463426204
Nevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the	357.98719852762537
urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the	477.24344329486246
young man’s road, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any	312.31946593819436
accident, and alighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at	321.9810047115786
which they had stopped on their first journey.	380.4862024677091
The host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra	376.08396541234094
horses, advanced respectfully to the door. Now, as they had already	355.6480682896358
traveled eleven leagues, D’Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether	360.92222687945724
Porthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to	343.7398711214863
ask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these	470.6786075586584
reflections was that D’Artagnan, without asking information of any	391.26322863614286
kind, alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered	415.94496462630025
a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and	295.1871327471913
desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a	471.53893431065046
breakfast as possible—a desire which further corroborated the high	332.5295014943376
opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.	439.742833670361
D’Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment	400.8971537317291
of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom;	416.3261869640507
and D’Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four	335.26515376160205
magnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not	398.5556103546319
fail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which	435.317065067041
D’Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced	411.9563910557734
the following conversation.	394.7722956498742
“My faith, my good host,” said D’Artagnan, filling the two glasses, “I	396.9528124923072
asked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me, you	328.52640239496884
will be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate	364.7178033055745
drinking by myself, you shall drink with me. Take your glass, then, and	355.3388803714836
let us drink. But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any	299.92495350419523
susceptibility? Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment.”	331.85114287347943
“Your Lordship does me much honor,” said the host, “and I thank you	322.041064881302
sincerely for your kind wish.”	316.73856611711494
“But don’t mistake,” said D’Artagnan, “there is more selfishness in my	467.8410092540573
toast than perhaps you may think—for it is only in prosperous	419.67960456080345
establishments that one is well received. In hôtels that do not	372.21057494236095
flourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to	351.21990463740855
the embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal,	337.4819958484518
particularly on this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a	410.71114408757694
fortune.”	411.0092631921486
“It seems to me,” said the host, “that this is not the first time I	313.5077062705173
have had the honor of seeing Monsieur.”	439.3420441023177
“Bah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the	382.7749868333095
ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least.	411.14365903838706
Why I was here only ten or twelve days ago. I was conducting some	406.545007658727
friends, Musketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a	369.597702192835
stranger—a man who sought a quarrel with him, for I don’t know what.”	431.62290165156566
“Exactly so,” said the host; “I remember it perfectly. It is not	363.75098940929666
Monsieur Porthos that your Lordship means?”	353.28377682229257
“Yes, that is my companion’s name. My God, my dear host, tell me if	432.5095790532489
anything has happened to him?”	394.2716683024523
“Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his	384.32536850645886
journey.”	455.1216295611219
“Why, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of	373.0502078314036
him.”	384.3819801588028
“He has done us the honor to remain here.”	452.8425078767682
“What, he had done you the honor to remain here?”	415.8280783749588
“Yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy—”	461.0033523219296
“On what account?”	307.4753721205746
“Of certain expenses he has contracted.”	464.68343755600165
“Well, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, I am sure he is in a	381.320805108151
condition to pay them.”	355.2828764050633
“Ah, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. We have made	442.00894022930595
considerable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that	415.8223174433458
if Monsieur Porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was I	474.138121670886
who had sent for him.”	322.24983078837045
“Porthos is wounded, then?”	420.22172666198446
“I cannot tell you, monsieur.”	448.4195428342067
“What! You cannot tell me? Surely you ought to be able to tell me	471.4171996463159
better than any other person.”	294.78939924164905
“Yes; but in our situation we must not say all we know—particularly as	423.10713992190153
we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues.”	482.1321300107066
“Well, can I see Porthos?”	313.0649696303866
“Certainly, monsieur. Take the stairs on your right; go up the first	479.44385121498806
flight and knock at Number One. Only warn him that it is you.”	339.08945825463366
“Why should I do that?”	447.2739743219416
“Because, monsieur, some mischief might happen to you.”	415.0311381535387
“Of what kind, in the name of wonder?”	307.4392303426609
“Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of	451.5416600752828
passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains.”	329.6042384805093
“What have you done to him, then?”	480.9303785855247
“We have asked him for money.”	414.40095373458905
“The devil! Ah, I can understand that. It is a demand that Porthos	488.683126597015
takes very ill when he is not in funds; but I know he must be so at	402.27136215331933
present.”	361.4084321762961
“We thought so, too, monsieur. As our house is carried on very	328.618886858215
regularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight	338.54413583753836
days we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky	397.09507573533756
moment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the	470.27376938660075
devils. It is true he had been playing the day before.”	474.35181605461696
“Playing the day before! And with whom?”	368.5748230476097
“Lord, who can say, monsieur? With some gentleman who was traveling	421.2077947283009
this way, to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet_.”	427.51234663420405
“That’s it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?”	293.4463846002778
“Even to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set	346.8348338287069
out, we perceived that his lackey was saddling Monsieur Porthos’s	468.73771515933765
horse, as well as his master’s. When we observed this to him, he told	371.4453244426872
us all to trouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse	408.3491832021302
belonged to him. We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going	303.1383412920932
on; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman’s word, and	312.9993803961992
that as he had said the horse was his, it must be so.”	330.91642273396275
“That’s Porthos all over,” murmured D’Artagnan.	374.49833972524414
“Then,” continued the host, “I replied that as from the moment we	429.7575309652588
seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to	393.4013904864811
payment, I hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the	410.689781361272
favor of his custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but	296.0317950573666
Monsieur Porthos replied that, my house being the best, he should	464.81853571029944
remain where he was. This reply was too flattering to allow me to	348.6604784653182
insist on his departure. I confined myself then to begging him to give	444.26187833390253
up his chamber, which is the handsomest in the hôtel, and to be	317.9985604496672
satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor; but to this	473.9931054632568
Monsieur Porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress,	359.5485747105426
who was one of the greatest ladies in the court, I might easily	422.60987527572127
comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house	332.3978862894098
was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage. Nevertheless,	446.9478426576332
while acknowledging the truth of what he said, I thought proper to	418.39253526121826
insist; but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any	381.23552064946045
discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid it on his table,	380.65423349645005
day and night, and said that at the first word that should be spoken to	348.14151792857274
him about removing, either within the house or out of it, he would blow	470.97316972340195
out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle	444.48979219973637
with a matter which only concerned himself. Since that time, monsieur,	316.73388043680086
nobody entered his chamber but his servant.”	408.3144644183551
“What! Mousqueton is here, then?”	490.5505387602079
“Oh, yes, monsieur. Five days after your departure, he came back, and	330.19808192900445
in a very bad condition, too. It appears that he had met with	382.90530813252076
disagreeableness, likewise, on his journey. Unfortunately, he is more	313.78133712525124
nimble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us	451.7435034606881
all under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for,	375.8392463913855
he takes all he wants without asking at all.”	446.83023783552136
“The fact is,” said D’Artagnan, “I have always observed a great degree	335.65710112730585
of intelligence and devotedness in Mousqueton.”	437.8578192904101
“That is possible, monsieur; but suppose I should happen to be brought	457.8148913372156
in contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and	479.8799394543872
devotedness—why, I should be a ruined man!”	491.5877960602047
“No, for Porthos will pay you.”	316.57292992953603
“Hum!” said the host, in a doubtful tone.	487.9171407072031
“The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced	362.6538601336589
for such a paltry sum as he owes you.”	373.5192835308111
“If I durst say what I believe on that head—”	362.7629193700929
“What you believe?”	404.4763999094099
“I ought rather to say, what I know.”	363.7218793817938
“What you know?”	350.2816362693754
“And even what I am sure of.”	488.12395641080434
“And of what are you so sure?”	462.34163458598607
“I would say that I know this great lady.”	373.78309135107776
“You?”	334.0674445174613
“Yes; I.”	406.46354908549245
“And how do you know her?”	442.36751259296267
“Oh, monsieur, if I could believe I might trust in your discretion.”	320.4561921497919
“Speak! By the word of a gentleman, you shall have no cause to repent	320.3259465883583
of your confidence.”	322.2414301304367
“Well, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many	422.8389308282975
things.”	295.9201204346145
“What have you done?”	457.0241176537977
“Oh, nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor.”	411.4916968611412
“Well?”	399.8613572812819
“Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it	366.95800567350017
in the post. This was before his servant came. As he could not leave	380.3712658081961
his chamber, it was necessary to charge us with this commission.”	486.35462897107186
“And then?”	434.98310980413123
“Instead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, I took	448.2099853538017
advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris, and ordered him to	453.75472216470314
convey the letter to this duchess himself. This was fulfilling the	418.0558561453699
intentions of Monsieur Porthos, who had desired us to be so careful of	434.5490235990175
this letter, was it not?”	422.5128442213597
“Nearly so.”	360.7655788723739
“Well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?”	434.57637471164094
“No; I have heard Porthos speak of her, that’s all.”	478.3600129409758
“Do you know who this pretended duchess is?	300.6987197526588
“I repeat to you, I don’t know her.”	427.4212972285037
“Why, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the Châtelet, monsieur,	361.8025454066419
named Madame Coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still	462.21286565430955
gives herself jealous airs. It struck me as very odd that a princess	485.69441395925236
should live in the Rue aux Ours.”	489.6253172041871
* Attorney	357.5501418467007
“But how do you know all this?”	404.5547735229968
“Because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying	472.2979813101427
that Monsieur Porthos was a weathercock, and that she was sure it was	385.4300590639224
for some woman he had received this wound.”	464.5044971665394
“Has he been wounded, then?”	397.61255248987857
“Oh, good Lord! What have I said?”	379.41537858037594
“You said that Porthos had received a sword cut.”	409.93576436420483
“Yes, but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so.”	425.2383579589465
“And why so.”	377.39708317558404
“Zounds, monsieur! Because he had boasted that he would perforate the	331.9397236129254
stranger with whom you left him in dispute; whereas the stranger, on	442.0959847612513
the contrary, in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his	443.8453373464135
back. As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man, he insists that	428.4180010305065
nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess, whom	425.9572370084642
he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure.”	466.4161470866175
“It is a wound that confines him to his bed?”	490.8809017045153
“Ah, and a master stroke, too, I assure you. Your friend’s soul must	362.55300387062744
stick tight to his body.”	342.28858109360135
“Were you there, then?”	459.0865325783905
“Monsieur, I followed them from curiosity, so that I saw the combat	346.51335268106095
without the combatants seeing me.”	304.81212013327564
“And what took place?”	429.47406267011786
“Oh! The affair was not long, I assure you. They placed themselves on	327.7063136823013
guard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that	436.25622887485366
when Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_, he had already three inches	360.26950735097176
of steel in his breast. He immediately fell backward. The stranger	388.52176314959985
placed the point of his sword at his throat; and Monsieur Porthos,	467.5742473471489
finding himself at the mercy of his adversary, acknowledged himself	345.66811738585034
conquered. Upon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it	402.9142911681673
was Porthos, and not D’Artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him	470.159609578379
back to the hôtel, mounted his horse, and disappeared.”	297.9682863325441
“So it was with Monsieur d’Artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel?”	456.22899420827446
“It appears so.”	318.3290434693325
“And do you know what has become of him?”	424.6455773859402
“No, I never saw him until that moment, and have not seen him since.”	491.79052684350404
“Very well; I know all that I wish to know. Porthos’s chamber is, you	462.8575950433599
say, on the first story, Number One?”	378.11440557619187
“Yes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn—a chamber that I could have	481.3087317335182
let ten times over.”	357.37151530761133
“Bah! Be satisfied,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “Porthos will pay you	327.6733015099895
with the money of the Duchess Coquenard.”	490.5120808727571
“Oh, monsieur, procurator’s wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her	479.61555798164864
pursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that	481.80818865181607
she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of Monsieur Porthos,	359.1277570698367
and that she would not send him a denier.”	308.93777521062054
“And did you convey this answer to your guest?”	358.5842641053697
“We took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion	388.6825769454668
we had executed his commission.”	293.9410489022382
“So that he still expects his money?”	431.16477360182535
“Oh, Lord, yes, monsieur! Yesterday he wrote again; but it was his	460.5388555008342
servant who this time put the letter in the post.”	385.3836792435814
“Do you say the procurator’s wife is old and ugly?”	456.38289770088033
“Fifty at least, monsieur, and not at all handsome, according to	308.46911919998746
Pathaud’s account.”	417.6778473333982
“In that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.	376.1540440628793
Besides, Porthos cannot owe you much.”	429.26498659798375
“How, not much! Twenty good pistoles, already, without reckoning the	406.03994295770644
doctor. He denies himself nothing; it may easily be seen he has been	345.60287996102676
accustomed to live well.”	474.6352711425832
“Never mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, I will	404.0710544703466
answer for it. So, my dear host, be not uneasy, and continue to take	425.860536607167
all the care of him that his situation requires.”	439.72371404196724
“Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator’s	431.010588575784
wife, and not to say a word of the wound?”	370.32463063663454
“That’s agreed; you have my word.”	446.5539404011774
“Oh, he would kill me!”	485.6550005319599
“Don’t be afraid; he is not so much of a devil as he appears.”	444.35029821438854
Saying these words, D’Artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little	452.7235649989793
better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be	370.2262362046418
very much interested—his debt and his life.	414.46580235260615
At the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the	392.59586885126544
corridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number “1.” D’Artagnan	485.7278200680304
knocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he	478.01079714175546
entered the chamber.	382.4346329792975
Porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with	443.20429908618956
Mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges	490.6565307902375
was turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece,	298.42181456564293
over two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled	411.7261107526578
a double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In	295.6547153898076
addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble	362.9071930126525
of a commode were covered with empty bottles.	485.1798007407699
At the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and	366.0502749561015
Mousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to	370.45963705443376
give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the	414.2353592082403
particular inspection.	489.1696479279566
“Ah, _pardieu!_ Is that you?” said Porthos to D’Artagnan. “You are	458.0466593308285
right welcome. Excuse my not coming to meet you; but,” added he,	422.08069583824886
looking at D’Artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, “you know	339.7391192456473
what has happened to me?”	437.66151979693984
“No.”	320.6037270718346
“Has the host told you nothing, then?”	439.26713751079996
“I asked after you, and came up as soon as I could.”	317.0651313921638
Porthos seemed to breathe more freely.	305.77420037493516
“And what has happened to you, my dear Porthos?” continued D’Artagnan.	312.40674660195003
“Why, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom I had already hit three	422.4609360405496
times, and whom I meant to finish with the fourth, I put my foot on a	395.88793406677144
stone, slipped, and strained my knee.”	328.1383951806834
“Truly?”	469.08886300809513
“Honor! Luckily for the rascal, for I should have left him dead on the	399.5697057320656
spot, I assure you.”	402.0150673921129
“And what has became of him?”	432.67212717045163
“Oh, I don’t know; he had enough, and set off without waiting for the	413.6700421215244
rest. But you, my dear D’Artagnan, what has happened to you?”	417.56814766754115
“So that this strain of the knee,” continued D’Artagnan, “my dear	480.52003627956185
Porthos, keeps you in bed?”	439.78193651283834
“My God, that’s all. I shall be about again in a few days.”	378.8599441173112
“Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris? You must be cruelly	379.8645360839116
bored here.”	400.55433383932376
“That was my intention; but, my dear friend, I have one thing to	421.64608021604647
confess to you.”	470.3036677869208
“What’s that?”	434.4296969283953
“It is that as I was cruelly bored, as you say, and as I had the	456.23624592664873
seventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in	309.4948418974547
order to amuse myself I invited a gentleman who was traveling this way	455.2779267520202
to walk up, and proposed a cast of dice. He accepted my challenge, and,	382.87469278749927
my faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his,	419.7391055759987
without reckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain. But you, my	430.43246219387333
dear D’Artagnan?”	404.08273248267017
“What can you expect, my dear Porthos; a man is not privileged in all	386.84553554494937
ways,” said D’Artagnan. “You know the proverb ‘Unlucky at play, lucky	311.91023209908786
in love.’ You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its	345.65904484850427
revenge. What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you? Have	481.5741808000443
you not, happy rogue that you are—have you not your duchess, who cannot	470.6698597044868
fail to come to your aid?”	394.18460780614805
“Well, you see, my dear D’Artagnan, with what ill luck I play,” replied	377.9382452803238
Porthos, with the most careless air in the world. “I wrote to her to	435.8294985352825
send me fifty louis or so, of which I stood absolutely in need on	355.9588720057719
account of my accident.”	401.1301882945336
“Well?”	454.50850654862
“Well, she must be at her country seat, for she has not answered me.”	404.89363021961907
“Truly?”	313.1143912360776
“No; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more	343.31737092592954
pressing than the first. But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak	428.4787018095325
of you. I confess I began to be very uneasy on your account.”	304.0933098222123
“But your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear	373.00573881840904
Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, directing the sick man’s attention to the	385.24049107882735
full stewpans and the empty bottles.	395.4725790479414
“So, so,” replied Porthos. “Only three or four days ago the impertinent	353.71483184582604
jackanapes gave me his bill, and I was forced to turn both him and his	321.5052556245463
bill out of the door; so that I am here something in the fashion of a	380.37676925655217
conqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. So you see,	397.0458463364863
being in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed	385.74010070245697
to the teeth.”	354.8626919893556
“And yet,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “it appears to me that from time	406.2181860701046
to time you must make _sorties_.” And he again pointed to the bottles	330.57886945120276
and the stewpans.	293.0836179585212
“Not I, unfortunately!” said Porthos. “This miserable strain confines	369.0340332104947
me to my bed; but Mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. Friend	471.6930374877069
Mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an	348.30158315940565
increase of supplies.”	422.05601631131475
“Mousqueton,” said D’Artagnan, “you must render me a service.”	398.8107095163228
“What, monsieur?”	374.02179086859053
“You must give your recipe to Planchet. I may be besieged in my turn,	420.6624261932176
and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same	346.17978606322754
advantages with which you gratify your master.”	371.8392360003435
“Lord, monsieur! There is nothing more easy,” said Mousqueton, with a	321.10194725630663
modest air. “One only needs to be sharp, that’s all. I was brought up	344.3939658524644
in the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a	410.4560973274199
poacher.”	340.550940907391
“And what did he do the rest of his time?”	342.4411130193937
“Monsieur, he carried on a trade which I have always thought	342.5475523929599
satisfactory.”	380.72971977040106
“Which?”	478.6291881228842
“As it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and	295.1942285320034
as he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots	459.80060638243395
exterminate the Catholics—all in the name of religion—he adopted a	453.9538043415022
mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a	411.3978293067584
Huguenot. Now, he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his	476.91221649791447
shoulder, behind the hedges which border the roads, and when he saw a	418.16760319294457
Catholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in	323.5604534646836
his mind. He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then,	414.4911850834227
when he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which	470.5757243541669
almost always ended by the traveler’s abandoning his purse to save his	484.0673352644758
life. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he	304.4847919004321
felt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not	424.48454985581236
understand how, a quarter of an hour before, he had been able to have	437.27875304278007
any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion. For my part,	348.0926648077452
monsieur, I am Catholic—my father, faithful to his principles, having	366.08686925476263
made my elder brother a Huguenot.”	444.95884647860646
“And what was the end of this worthy man?” asked D’Artagnan.	365.2196266231372
“Oh, of the most unfortunate kind, monsieur. One day he was surprised	387.5328548034048
in a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic, with both of whom	292.18141222113536
he had before had business, and who both knew him again; so they united	351.2071801982749
against him and hanged him on a tree. Then they came and boasted of	292.13966910455565
their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village, where my brother	320.4655922587671
and I were drinking.”	455.7392419320943
“And what did you do?” said D’Artagnan.	392.5902494257904
“We let them tell their story out,” replied Mousqueton. “Then, as in	487.29000111280413
leaving the cabaret they took different directions, my brother went and	361.1324006028661
hid himself on the road of the Catholic, and I on that of the Huguenot.	304.5525039382388
Two hours after, all was over; we had done the business of both,	334.93160074299396
admiring the foresight of our poor father, who had taken the precaution	368.147421103243
to bring each of us up in a different religion.”	348.7346275018401
“Well, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent	418.75467524953297
fellow. And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a	484.25692323964756
poacher?”	380.9133999678777
“Yes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a	365.63036340403335
line. The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at	392.76993448402106
all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little	465.8246756153643
of my old trade. While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince, I	311.6535703260867
laid a few snares in the runs; and while reclining on the banks of his	418.97500997755725
Highness’s pieces of water, I slipped a few lines into his fish ponds.	406.77293925872857
So that now, thanks be to God, we do not want, as Monsieur can testify,	415.8962002532412
for partridges, rabbits, carp or eels—all light, wholesome food,	471.922453659884
suitable for the sick.”	330.62485251053863
“But the wine,” said D’Artagnan, “who furnishes the wine? Your host?”	407.0400525841701
“That is to say, yes and no.”	357.6806757446618
“How yes and no?”	354.3888334432336
“He furnishes it, it is true, but he does not know that he has that	296.64056083706095
honor.”	327.12839648730153
“Explain yourself, Mousqueton; your conversation is full of instructive	408.63956941282026
things.”	293.1233417320635
“That is it, monsieur. It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in	361.53079339957833
my peregrinations who had seen many countries, and among them the New	295.9341088874765
World.”	443.65483127298126
“What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on	351.8882527636147
the commode and the wardrobe?”	329.2143745443816
“Patience, monsieur, everything will come in its turn.”	306.7764027346638
“This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in	450.8780234699967
his voyage to Mexico. This lackey was my compatriot; and we became the	392.3109532797898
more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between	393.9273095621681
us. We loved sporting of all kinds better than anything; so that he	411.2108307187685
related to me how in the plains of the Pampas the natives hunt the	441.005168855584
tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to	312.8242355836078
a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such	339.89767201200607
nicety; but in face of the proof I was obliged to acknowledge the truth	452.49076094580226
of the recital. My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty	468.8368638537238
paces, and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running	416.8189357370734
noose. I practiced this exercise, and as nature has endowed me with	454.53604766640984
some faculties, at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the	298.15967937259626
world. Well, do you understand, monsieur? Our host has a well-furnished	355.0327667638742
cellar the key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a	460.453759257269
ventilating hole. Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso,	409.28572712159456
and as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine, that’s	473.17960351082206
my point for sport. You see, monsieur, what the New World has to do	307.3140566677525
with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe. Now, will	442.4031968746734
you taste our wine, and without prejudice say what you think of it?”	455.32711532600837
“Thank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, I have just	401.12082732066784
breakfasted.”	459.58392341235174
“Well,” said Porthos, “arrange the table, Mousqueton, and while we	441.91861747557147
breakfast, D’Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during	366.4943261291718
the ten days since he left us.”	301.6460556287102
“Willingly,” said D’Artagnan.	308.201239310069
While Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of	325.07630564148604
convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in	439.04547474110086
misfortune, D’Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged	407.8024382088926
to stop at Crèvecœur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with	412.76125822012284
four men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, D’Artagnan, had	355.8725485206682
been forced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to	377.61801129315415
reach England.	455.7427967096236
But there the confidence of D’Artagnan stopped. He only added that on	390.58228947456627
his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent	458.4711702936561
horses—one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he	352.51708291314
informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in	403.7196468117204
the stable of the tavern.	321.7024390772495
At this moment Planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses	395.9985061958281
were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at	461.38099530022856
Clermont.	388.1033516630351
As D’Artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to Porthos, and as he	431.3385850553604
was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his	441.4345936128019
hand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route	316.08977453526893
in order to continue his researches. For the rest, as he reckoned upon	420.3118020858269
returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were	341.8397210637628
still at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.	348.842817139131
Porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him	410.9924248500498
to depart yet awhile. Besides, it was necessary he should stay at	485.70381116215776
Chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.	487.958541150232
D’Artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having	337.2021084157059
again recommended Porthos to the care of Mousqueton, and paid his bill	300.3961708958522
to the host, he resumed his route with Planchet, already relieved of	386.98968086863954
one of his led horses.	351.44184686631746
Chapter XXVI.	398.0943016639636
ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS	470.69090130406903
D’Artagnan had said nothing to Porthos of his wound or of his	354.809862493509
procurator’s wife. Our Béarnais was a prudent lad, however young he	355.06505508249654
might be. Consequently he had appeared to believe all that the	370.457058338765
vainglorious Musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will	410.55069121945377
hold out against a surprised secret. Besides, we feel always a sort of	446.8094126080773
mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they	309.2223027628303
suppose. In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as	338.43271317845176
he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune,	383.9067804319278
D’Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the	379.226980441118
invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them.	296.87911004624436
And yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his	302.86716932578344
heart. He thought of that young and pretty Mme. Bonacieux who was to	399.92878004152533
have paid him the price of his devotedness; but let us hasten to say	302.8764542863103
that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the	417.8733623530089
happiness he had missed, than from the fear he entertained that some	349.96050864901423
serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman. For himself, he had no	368.5122266918669
doubt she was a victim of the cardinal’s vengeance; and, as was well	421.2236850257751
known, the vengeance of his Eminence was terrible. How he had found	341.70053316750955
grace in the eyes of the minister, he did not know; but without doubt	474.95417156430864
M. de Cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the	292.6820961856961
Guards had found him at home.	419.4447172288994
Nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a	445.96399663107036
thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization	371.03551498718116
of him who thinks. External existence then resembles a sleep of which	301.64692266026185
this thought is the dream. By its influence, time has no longer	359.38990124155475
measure, space has no longer distance. We depart from one place, and	407.01077934216613
arrive at another, that is all. Of the interval passed, nothing remains	375.2060574738545
in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of	309.03031080535004
trees, mountains, and landscapes are lost. It was as a prey to this	477.02340861754794
hallucination that D’Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse	428.0300125556083
pleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from	470.8622323583335
Crèvecœur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the	465.0106717599803
village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.	369.40622648672286
There only his memory returned to him. He shook his head, perceived the	380.0724574474454
cabaret at which he had left Aramis, and putting his horse to the trot,	350.50693939648346
he shortly pulled up at the door.	348.83514720126715
This time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. D’Artagnan	390.5880890216805
was a physiognomist. His eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful	364.1847862730825
countenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived	391.13147068107816
there was no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything	401.7452571343962
from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy.	341.0046311441017
“My good dame,” asked D’Artagnan, “can you tell me what has become of	325.1474481950964
one of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen	399.1661229664669
days ago?”	390.4193213560685
“A handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild,	377.4272722838159
amiable, and well made?”	472.6371757086537
“That is he—wounded in the shoulder.”	468.20624986850567
“Just so. Well, monsieur, he is still here.”	459.4040635036146
“Ah, _pardieu!_ My dear dame,” said D’Artagnan, springing from his	418.49435877421126
horse, and throwing the bridle to Planchet, “you restore me to life;	407.62863617501506
where is this dear Aramis? Let me embrace him, I am in a hurry to see	466.79692814763354
him again.”	302.9790122504799
“Pardon, monsieur, but I doubt whether he can see you at this moment.”	423.39168957388483
“Why so? Has he a lady with him?”	326.70365225635675
“Jesus! What do you mean by that? Poor lad! No, monsieur, he has not a	332.354238597523
lady with him.”	297.30775412061695
“With whom is he, then?”	431.27506962931284
“With the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits of	336.00536346054776
Amiens.”	455.1031143189133
“Good heavens!” cried D’Artagnan, “is the poor fellow worse, then?”	487.44082065591715
“No, monsieur, quite the contrary; but after his illness grace touched	457.7143732082434
him, and he determined to take orders.”	340.5902691582514
“That’s it!” said D’Artagnan, “I had forgotten that he was only a	383.29558007288614
Musketeer for a time.”	456.6722970502293
“Monsieur still insists upon seeing him?”	490.89431128882575
“More than ever.”	458.8056225994709
“Well, monsieur has only to take the right-hand staircase in the	479.94877726129795
courtyard, and knock at Number Five on the second floor.”	395.10942715755164
D’Artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated, and found one of	442.2556232929762
those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our	299.6755168109023
old-fashioned taverns. But there was no getting at the place of sojourn	301.70388568408913
of the future abbé; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well	366.4045718941194
guarded as the gardens of Armida. Bazin was stationed in the corridor,	295.01843440413205
and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years	350.968624362201
of trial, Bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been	296.1640561783215
ambitious.	385.8875579666558
In fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman;	299.6814249130946
and he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when	355.30040322011484
Aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. The	456.94704186437264
daily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long	463.6925223424404
be delayed, had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer—a service	315.4088075911042
in which, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy.	346.36418699075006
Bazin was then at the height of joy. In all probability, this time his	386.98734555565665
master would not retract. The union of physical pain with moral	470.9140669640612
uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. Aramis, suffering	351.3171650660986
at once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts	386.5942285560904
upon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the	422.9275239171641
double accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden	484.7589705254509
disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder.	339.06459778089913
It may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his	337.27087689242467
master nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of	452.5388680033189
D’Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of	359.0593543357916
mundane affairs which had so long carried him away. He resolved, then,	379.30604308804686
to defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the	332.59582538711595
inn, he could not say that Aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to	462.26145013351186
the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his	295.6717181149169
master in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning	439.04558510204794
and would not, as Bazin said, terminate before night.	399.25016655257207
But D’Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M.	490.4533500535169
Bazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his	333.78349686413867
friend’s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and	354.7964453801655
with the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five. The door	426.2170364927558
opened, and D’Artagnan went into the chamber.	466.20884727840144
Aramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat	348.90842442904136
cap, not much unlike a _calotte_, was seated before an oblong table,	349.6482574844193
covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. At his right	439.9952766254378
hand was placed the superior of the Jesuits, and on his left the curate	429.0109493526441
of Montdidier. The curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the	483.77934071848335
mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. All the mundane	487.2558471026953
objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young	471.94978280763246
man, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared	360.5341035075818
as if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them	316.38537990274597
might bring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his	314.81342856660206
hands upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of	315.77876847568723
all kinds and sorts. In their stead D’Artagnan thought he perceived in	421.5463616028875
an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.	369.4517580421196
At the noise made by D’Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head,	366.61850383481993
and beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man,	475.99203115606167
the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so	295.30369840565925
completely was his mind detached from the things of this world.	483.3807567869378
“Good day, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis; “believe me, I am glad to see	491.4512482164754
you.”	462.3912567393544
“So am I delighted to see you,” said D’Artagnan, “although I am not yet	463.7207560526099
sure that it is Aramis I am speaking to.”	386.8355332989468
“To himself, my friend, to himself! But what makes you doubt it?”	374.782330365632
“I was afraid I had made a mistake in the chamber, and that I had found	397.36845442148723
my way into the apartment of some churchman. Then another error seized	325.18990823110386
me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen—I was afraid you were	332.6097919150339
dangerously ill.”	419.4602918614655
The two men in black, who guessed D’Artagnan’s meaning, darted at him a	376.27022275168645
glance which might have been thought threatening; but D’Artagnan took	311.69456680993204
no heed of it.	456.0370709286864
“I disturb you, perhaps, my dear Aramis,” continued D’Artagnan, “for by	314.4447752581752
what I see, I am led to believe that you are confessing to these	481.62884200743594
gentlemen.”	299.5656165711626
Aramis colored imperceptibly. “You disturb me? Oh, quite the contrary,	319.9390457940183
dear friend, I swear; and as a proof of what I say, permit me to	397.37534399739195
declare I am rejoiced to see you safe and sound.”	454.1538069895464
“Ah, he’ll come round,” thought D’Artagnan; “that’s not bad!”	356.2133728948925
“This gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious	338.86087292610705
danger,” continued Aramis, with unction, pointing to D’Artagnan with	327.4925221892734
his hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.	454.32358863215836
“Praise God, monsieur,” replied they, bowing together.	378.3257896679952
“I have not failed to do so, your Reverences,” replied the young man,	480.14957033205496
returning their salutation.	325.33983622717267
“You arrive in good time, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, “and by taking	333.7446964926442
part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence. Monsieur	357.92288000255616
the Principal of Amiens, Monsieur the Curate of Montdidier, and I are	300.85572634690965
arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much	421.26556141828
interested; I shall be delighted to have your opinion.”	351.7330338715656
“The opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight,” replied	392.7856056569581
D’Artagnan, who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking, “and	473.51085645444175
you had better be satisfied, believe me, with the knowledge of these	293.2937055755495
gentlemen.”	406.45181833596405
The two men in black bowed in their turn.	317.2718640650573
“On the contrary,” replied Aramis, “your opinion will be very valuable.	314.17340669711825
The question is this: Monsieur the Principal thinks that my thesis	459.5149791271331
ought to be dogmatic and didactic.”	427.64463015437894
“Your thesis! Are you then making a thesis?”	469.84248903722016
“Without doubt,” replied the Jesuit. “In the examination which precedes	396.0202318631467
ordination, a thesis is always a requisite.”	464.15174258278523
“Ordination!” cried D’Artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess	448.9375820304998
and Bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon	450.68508858284986
the three persons before him.	449.05317009888716
“Now,” continued Aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy	318.35054607331347
chair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his	377.48759355649423
hand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he	349.45739648787844
held in the air to cause the blood to descend, “now, as you have heard,	451.0934706345886
D’Artagnan, Monsieur the Principal is desirous that my thesis should be	401.09260033774467
dogmatic, while I, for my part, would rather it should be ideal. This	337.4190668571508
is the reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the	487.09049046564786
following subject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which I	477.6122083669694
perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration—‘_Utraque manus in	390.3757847110327
benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_.’”	319.477885877446
D’Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no	366.44067633586616
more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de	297.95725040888755
Tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that D’Artagnan had	430.1125136244359
received from the Duke of Buckingham.	419.8601002683684
“Which means,” resumed Aramis, that he might perfectly understand,	352.0059802458007
“‘The two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders,	344.5829489974426
when they bestow the benediction.’”	292.7042829564014
“An admirable subject!” cried the Jesuit.	484.6088553970201
“Admirable and dogmatic!” repeated the curate, who, about as strong as	336.2280911392321
D’Artagnan with respect to Latin, carefully watched the Jesuit in order	347.50737515763245
to keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo.	473.0917740434835
As to D’Artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of	454.7356863709886
the two men in black.	433.8727629891431
“Yes, admirable! _prorsus admirabile!_” continued Aramis; “but which	294.93306446805923
requires a profound study of both the Scriptures and the Fathers. Now,	443.5594217134858
I have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all	470.3723672907489
humility, that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king	351.50189454856843
have caused me to neglect study a little. I should find myself,	421.70650046393496
therefore, more at my ease, _facilius natans_, in a subject of my own	341.76044748310846
choice, which would be to these hard theological questions what morals	417.5740065686535
are to metaphysics in philosophy.”	444.73050751379606
D’Artagnan began to be tired, and so did the curate.	336.60310338742016
“See what an exordium!” cried the Jesuit.	464.23334419958826
“Exordium,” repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.	327.14608561422426
“_Quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem_.”	304.9379030145392
Aramis cast a glance upon D’Artagnan to see what effect all this	306.72076554619025
produced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.	324.74159990398937
“Let us speak French, my father,” said he to the Jesuit; “Monsieur	463.26582484787195
d’Artagnan will enjoy our conversation better.”	333.92248882379977
“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan; “I am fatigued with reading, and all this	338.0287383860973
Latin confuses me.”	463.64233562715617
“Certainly,” replied the Jesuit, a little put out, while the curate,	350.5505330379412
greatly delighted, turned upon D’Artagnan a look full of gratitude.	456.0901390687824
“Well, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss. Moses, the	377.4461833618029
servant of God—he was but a servant, please to understand—Moses blessed	351.9891125991025
with the hands; he held out both his arms while the Hebrews beat their	297.38731030119095
enemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands. Besides, what	319.4931028409775
does the Gospel say? _Imponite manus_, and not _manum_—place the	305.42100703052364
_hands_, not the _hand_.”	411.25782500022115
“Place the _hands_,” repeated the curate, with a gesture.	380.7661946669996
“St. Peter, on the contrary, of whom the Popes are the successors,”	437.67539023781103
continued the Jesuit; “_porrige digitos_—present the fingers. Are you	476.747201802419
there, now?”	398.3400482160422
“_Certes_,” replied Aramis, in a pleased tone, “but the thing is	314.2936587288058
subtle.”	445.40802243763073
“The _fingers_,” resumed the Jesuit, “St. Peter blessed with the	361.30769057196943
_fingers_. The Pope, therefore blesses with the fingers. And with how	441.6301350573028
many fingers does he bless? With _three_ fingers, to be sure—one for	427.3504689746769
the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost.”	476.75168703709136
All crossed themselves. D’Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this	420.59906610385633
example.	323.7923428965617
“The Pope is the successor of St. Peter, and represents the three	434.8310816177654
divine powers; the rest—_ordines inferiores_—of the ecclesiastical	486.1812551946758
hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. The most	431.45034606355387
humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water	336.91672103125916
sprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers.	418.1094186714162
There is the subject simplified. _Argumentum omni denudatum ornamento_.	327.76552881732624
I could make of that subject two volumes the size of this,” continued	398.3999221476014
the Jesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a St. Chrysostom in folio,	356.74925698314337
which made the table bend beneath its weight.	446.6867460364766
D’Artagnan trembled.	313.52536827229994
“_Certes_,” said Aramis, “I do justice to the beauties of this thesis;	381.0548410944251
but at the same time I perceive it would be overwhelming for me. I had	295.2751444605904
chosen this text—tell me, dear D’Artagnan, if it is not to your	405.75465387416693
taste—‘_Non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_’; that is, ‘A little	490.8831046639875
regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the Lord.’”	427.91627178808005
“Stop there!” cried the Jesuit, “for that thesis touches closely upon	358.9433072411795
heresy. There is a proposition almost like it in the _Augustinus_ of	478.424170108614
the heresiarch Jansenius, whose book will sooner or later be burned by	417.26621113801474
the hands of the executioner. Take care, my young friend. You are	446.92410266440777
inclining toward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost.”	353.43667341761636
“You will be lost,” said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully.	315.493444134827
“You approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock.	372.64253184237793
You face the insinuations of the Pelagians and the semi-Pelagians.”	353.425998712265
“But, my Reverend—” replied Aramis, a little amazed by the shower of	299.8112847385392
arguments that poured upon his head.	416.0889332298302
“How will you prove,” continued the Jesuit, without allowing him time	469.8467395717423
to speak, “that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to	325.68921104325835
God? Listen to this dilemma: God is God, and the world is the devil. To	394.29811962365176
regret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion.”	462.07484028308045
“And that is mine also,” said the curate.	428.23564170078976
“But, for heaven’s sake—” resumed Aramis.	378.227466664928
“_Desideras diabolum_, unhappy man!” cried the Jesuit.	320.5818771308951
“He regrets the devil! Ah, my young friend,” added the curate,	344.9999430906662
groaning, “do not regret the devil, I implore you!”	458.0479494157912
D’Artagnan felt himself bewildered. It seemed to him as though he were	443.5780821639216
in a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw. He was,	393.384884708774
however, forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the	350.628837225545
language they employed.	379.3452679322078
“But listen to me, then,” resumed Aramis with politeness mingled with a	322.85274948093746
little impatience. “I do not say I regret; no, I will never pronounce	354.62547172018094
that sentence, which would not be orthodox.”	407.65222625370694
The Jesuit raised his hands toward heaven, and the curate did the same.	328.35812309337
“No; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to	456.5679004930304
the Lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted! Don’t you	330.2371932673505
think so, D’Artagnan?”	362.5805139983375
“I think so, indeed,” cried he.	392.77227937224836
The Jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs.	424.3028385435337
“This is the point of departure; it is a syllogism. The world is not	397.0570408397247
wanting in attractions. I quit the world; then I make a sacrifice. Now,	350.1046076908634
the Scripture says positively, ‘Make a sacrifice unto the Lord.’”	488.3134047146833
“That is true,” said his antagonists.	334.96833854199014
“And then,” said Aramis, pinching his ear to make it red, as he rubbed	489.38366263665034
his hands to make them white, “and then I made a certain _rondeau_ upon	351.7193970255396
it last year, which I showed to Monsieur Voiture, and that great man	401.1132463434341
paid me a thousand compliments.”	476.7708629990185
“A _rondeau!_” said the Jesuit, disdainfully.	450.1352464971676
“A _rondeau!_” said the curate, mechanically.	301.0786185907044
“Repeat it! Repeat it!” cried D’Artagnan; “it will make a little	394.3730619695822
change.”	422.5227238365834
“Not so, for it is religious,” replied Aramis; “it is theology in	434.4383656385798
verse.”	386.71614633670265
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan.	404.6353926591648
“Here it is,” said Aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which,	409.5061137726579
however, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy:	459.3084764578032
“Vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes,	415.6207258972649
    Et qui trainez des jours infortunés,	476.1839297659236
    Tous vos malheurs se verront terminés,	331.7373017760609
Quand à Dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes,	346.305839386004
        Vous qui pleurez!”	377.20832998762955
“You who weep for pleasures fled,	395.12204080334527
    While dragging on a life of care,	442.37840942617777
    All your woes will melt in air,	383.5335104245323
If to God your tears are shed,	458.5456140221542
        You who weep!”	330.7270933891515
D’Artagnan and the curate appeared pleased. The Jesuit persisted in his	349.3797729322265
opinion. “Beware of a profane taste in your theological style. What	379.28439575592836
says Augustine on this subject: ‘_Severus sit clericorum verbo_.’”	489.1808552368261
“Yes, let the sermon be clear,” said the curate.	361.58468791827755
“Now,” hastily interrupted the Jesuit, on seeing that his acolyte was	306.49396708971955
going astray, “now your thesis would please the ladies; it would have	295.01710350033085
the success of one of Monsieur Patru’s pleadings.”	341.146647894172
“Please God!” cried Aramis, transported.	349.15267528995014
“There it is,” cried the Jesuit; “the world still speaks within you in	435.42998748472877
a loud voice, _altisimâ voce_. You follow the world, my young friend,	488.35777261731516
and I tremble lest grace prove not efficacious.”	413.0772964885977
“Be satisfied, my reverend father, I can answer for myself.”	336.8598201572814
“Mundane presumption!”	415.0547248681704
“I know myself, Father; my resolution is irrevocable.”	422.3514908916719
“Then you persist in continuing that thesis?”	386.3818776197141
“I feel myself called upon to treat that, and no other. I will see	302.45514524601856
about the continuation of it, and tomorrow I hope you will be satisfied	445.8387569149246
with the corrections I shall have made in consequence of your advice.”	296.20905830876814
“Work slowly,” said the curate; “we leave you in an excellent tone of	352.76730637091003
mind.”	444.4216723661815
“Yes, the ground is all sown,” said the Jesuit, “and we have not to	415.4043143056492
fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another	476.27269291586254
upon the highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest,	312.9462205827784
_aves cœli comederunt illam_.”	382.977119890332
“Plague stifle you and your Latin!” said D’Artagnan, who began to feel	344.9181135846133
all his patience exhausted.	446.2465298132139
“Farewell, my son,” said the curate, “till tomorrow.”	410.7989435244143
“Till tomorrow, rash youth,” said the Jesuit. “You promise to become	470.13155576227155
one of the lights of the Church. Heaven grant that this light prove not	299.39010955298306
a devouring fire!”	357.713722603976
D’Artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with	421.7067240648271
impatience, was beginning to attack the quick.	470.423241912217
The two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and D’Artagnan, and advanced	431.7288147832464
toward the door. Bazin, who had been standing listening to all this	299.8101057114342
controversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the	475.43259357895704
breviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit, and walked	364.62216550999096
respectfully before them to clear their way.	484.0419631254359
Aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately	391.03839698710334
came up again to D’Artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of	314.8352321869012
confusion.	382.10471643083645
When left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.	462.9089560049049
It however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as	470.3803703291055
D’Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion,	329.1685992782491
Aramis said, “you see that I am returned to my fundamental ideas.”	319.2290679234033
“Yes, efficacious grace has touched you, as that gentleman said just	381.31389935220113
now.”	352.8192595308619
“Oh, these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time. You have	303.53303764437345
often heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?”	471.7735960702828
“Yes; but I confess I always thought you jested.”	422.7765807048389
“With such things! Oh, D’Artagnan!”	425.88809715461684
“The devil! Why, people jest with death.”	418.5571124224198
“And people are wrong, D’Artagnan; for death is the door which leads to	361.5361723535526
perdition or to salvation.”	421.87201690708326
“Granted; but if you please, let us not theologize, Aramis. You must	466.08808250094637
have had enough for today. As for me, I have almost forgotten the	383.222313995616
little Latin I have ever known. Then I confess to you that I have eaten	441.7076301962975
nothing since ten o’clock this morning, and I am devilish hungry.”	360.6418155163839
“We will dine directly, my friend; only you must please to remember	415.51263931813554
that this is Friday. Now, on such a day I can neither eat flesh nor see	336.43945531972093
it eaten. If you can be satisfied with my dinner—it consists of cooked	308.63800280708796
tetragones and fruits.”	409.4645566545543
“What do you mean by tetragones?” asked D’Artagnan, uneasily.	397.15237341691363
“I mean spinach,” replied Aramis; “but on your account I will add some	304.9607045301773
eggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule—for eggs are meat,	334.6651416172301
since they engender chickens.”	334.93067364352436
“This feast is not very succulent; but never mind, I will put up with	383.9502851802979
it for the sake of remaining with you.”	306.66568416584926
“I am grateful to you for the sacrifice,” said Aramis; “but if your	434.0175997239811
body be not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will.”	413.5992227321539
“And so, Aramis, you are decidedly going into the Church? What will our	312.6466633436613
two friends say? What will Monsieur de Tréville say? They will treat	334.68283102952125
you as a deserter, I warn you.”	380.04150274738674
“I do not enter the Church; I re-enter it. I deserted the Church for	306.2034901396767
the world, for you know that I forced myself when I became a	326.0099639563913
Musketeer.”	394.80874962107947
“I? I know nothing about it.”	429.823062866775
“You don’t know I quit the seminary?”	486.5303259248755
“Not at all.”	381.9063445321515
“This is my story, then. Besides, the Scriptures say, ‘Confess	295.1360852044962
yourselves to one another,’ and I confess to you, D’Artagnan.”	408.0230454457203
“And I give you absolution beforehand. You see I am a good sort of a	468.63381002802623
man.”	382.9074893776819
“Do not jest about holy things, my friend.”	340.05653212390985
“Go on, then, I listen.”	335.00149801098274
“I had been at the seminary from nine years old; in three days I should	471.9722594865592
have been twenty. I was about to become an abbé, and all was arranged.	487.17601172732657
One evening I went, according to custom, to a house which I frequented	393.8939717411158
with much pleasure: when one is young, what can be expected?—one is	302.06042869750314
weak. An officer who saw me, with a jealous eye, reading the _Lives of	465.1898794987151
the Saints_ to the mistress of the house, entered suddenly and without	407.68108438233975
being announced. That evening I had translated an episode of Judith,	308.0827804159374
and had just communicated my verses to the lady, who gave me all sorts	476.81499630288823
of compliments, and leaning on my shoulder, was reading them a second	380.88389490577316
time with me. Her pose, which I must admit was rather free, wounded	303.102392435666
this officer. He said nothing; but when I went out he followed, and	479.764202588883
quickly came up with me. ‘Monsieur the Abbé,’ said he, ‘do you like	309.4392974564336
blows with a cane?’ ‘I cannot say, monsieur,’ answered I; ‘no one has	412.33758111568
ever dared to give me any.’ ‘Well, listen to me, then, Monsieur the	366.9733756988579
Abbé! If you venture again into the house in which I have met you this	457.26585380841715
evening, I will dare it myself.’ I really think I must have been	477.19367332939123
frightened. I became very pale; I felt my legs fail me; I sought for a	304.30821319784286
reply, but could find none—I was silent. The officer waited for his	479.31613090095397
reply, and seeing it so long coming, he burst into a laugh, turned upon	302.75223063129283
his heel, and re-entered the house. I returned to the seminary.	448.0624457635787
“I am a gentleman born, and my blood is warm, as you may have remarked,	338.4938269532349
my dear D’Artagnan. The insult was terrible, and although unknown to	417.3738968441219
the rest of the world, I felt it live and fester at the bottom of my	321.1029495862181
heart. I informed my superiors that I did not feel myself sufficiently	378.5846939328146
prepared for ordination, and at my request the ceremony was postponed	360.28893592273903
for a year. I sought out the best fencing master in Paris, I made an	335.0176181949911
agreement with him to take a lesson every day, and every day for a year	469.4745839878041
I took that lesson. Then, on the anniversary of the day on which I had	334.6678419654409
been insulted, I hung my cassock on a peg, assumed the costume of a	354.2470359541424
cavalier, and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to	317.4743994046893
which I knew my man was invited. It was in the Rue des	428.9928469404631
France-Bourgeois, close to La Force. As I expected, my officer was	421.88934746569896
there. I went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking	371.52641121934323
tenderly at a lady, and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the	298.67468429203035
second couplet. ‘Monsieur,’ said I, ‘does it still displease you that I	355.36440731041733
should frequent a certain house of La Rue Payenne? And would you still	355.9384772165756
cane me if I took it into my head to disobey you? The officer looked at	421.41535047103025
me with astonishment, and then said, ‘What is your business with me,	432.1340126132761
monsieur? I do not know you.’ ‘I am,’ said I, ‘the little abbé who	364.71726902813225
reads _Lives of the Saints_, and translates Judith into verse.’ ‘Ah,	355.470048188624
ah! I recollect now,’ said the officer, in a jeering tone; ‘well, what	382.41653943910256
do you want with me?’ ‘I want you to spare time to take a walk with	443.39503638550804
me.’ ‘Tomorrow morning, if you like, with the greatest pleasure.’ ‘No,	448.9523123676671
not tomorrow morning, if you please, but immediately.’ ‘If you	371.2890965993487
absolutely insist.’ ‘I do insist upon it.’ ‘Come, then. Ladies,’ said	372.5396754340179
the officer, ‘do not disturb yourselves; allow me time just to kill	384.9097687778574
this gentleman, and I will return and finish the last couplet.’	469.1962833608948
“We went out. I took him to the Rue Payenne, to exactly the same spot	327.2218556178963
where, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the	401.6317332153087
compliment I have related to you. It was a superb moonlight night. We	379.05645266217675
immediately drew, and at the first pass I laid him stark dead.”	345.42531426186963
“The devil!” cried D’Artagnan.	448.6468274708264
“Now,” continued Aramis, “as the ladies did not see the singer come	477.16707983726053
back, and as he was found in the Rue Payenne with a great sword wound	325.00827488294965
through his body, it was supposed that I had accommodated him thus; and	297.5090154669014
the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the	366.7170619961141
cassock for a time. Athos, whose acquaintance I made about that period,	455.5201963372796
and Porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective	374.7902539437508
tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a	485.2140624973095
Musketeer. The king entertained great regard for my father, who had	308.04282139270157
fallen at the siege of Arras, and the uniform was granted. You may	484.3200946700869
understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the	320.64571497828524
Church.”	396.7404367830776
“And why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow? What has happened to	407.49114835365833
you today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?”	306.2614044178133
“This wound, my dear D’Artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven.”	451.2475440574202
“This wound? Bah, it is now nearly healed, and I am sure it is not that	311.50434394174465
which gives you the most pain.”	399.61504173135313
“What, then?” said Aramis, blushing.	434.2202225398462
“You have one at heart, Aramis, one deeper and more painful—a wound	407.8505795622718
made by a woman.”	443.18594985007076
The eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself.	369.0658055377976
“Ah,” said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness,	315.7725417471023
“do not talk of such things, and suffer love pains? _Vanitas	406.0382097288751
vanitatum!_ According to your idea, then, my brain is turned. And for	462.8213971018374
whom—for some _grisette_, some chambermaid with whom I have trifled in	446.57371931667774
some garrison? Fie!”	358.3009596237597
“Pardon, my dear Aramis, but I thought you carried your eyes higher.”	330.48488682774166
“Higher? And who am I, to nourish such ambition? A poor Musketeer, a	372.84195613874897
beggar, an unknown—who hates slavery, and finds himself ill-placed in	407.4098318123397
the world.”	425.62794252655226
“Aramis, Aramis!” cried D’Artagnan, looking at his friend with an air	420.5367504770257
of doubt.	402.0829721781596
“Dust I am, and to dust I return. Life is full of humiliations and	346.1940251438931
sorrows,” continued he, becoming still more melancholy; “all the ties	405.6758812266903
which attach him to life break in the hand of man, particularly the	327.1797526167081
golden ties. Oh, my dear D’Artagnan,” resumed Aramis, giving to his	488.97616257156744
voice a slight tone of bitterness, “trust me! Conceal your wounds when	329.09678445712507
you have any; silence is the last joy of the unhappy. Beware of giving	473.7117837718993
anyone the clue to your griefs; the curious suck our tears as flies	324.8266556262278
suck the blood of a wounded hart.”	486.648715595359
“Alas, my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, in his turn heaving a profound	337.97493611149144
sigh, “that is my story you are relating!”	457.4043235841078
“How?”	320.4508651523813
“Yes; a woman whom I love, whom I adore, has just been torn from me by	429.81022628209394
force. I do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her.	381.68415318181417
She is perhaps a prisoner; she is perhaps dead!”	394.1259768502424
“Yes, but you have at least this consolation, that you can say to	388.2886760079875
yourself she has not quit you voluntarily, that if you learn no news of	480.63457144466537
her, it is because all communication with you is interdicted; while I—”	490.86700165874606
“Well?”	442.953328611313
“Nothing,” replied Aramis, “nothing.”	365.90203585362474
“So you renounce the world, then, forever; that is a settled thing—a	404.95105994946425
resolution registered!”	389.2275688323192
“Forever! You are my friend today; tomorrow you will be no more to me	308.3498161864747
than a shadow, or rather, even, you will no longer exist. As for the	480.87814119934785
world, it is a sepulcher and nothing else.”	414.81310077144735
“The devil! All this is very sad which you tell me.”	309.1494694763636
“What will you? My vocation commands me; it carries me away.”	419.32330803095067
D’Artagnan smiled, but made no answer.	306.1628349378058
Aramis continued, “And yet, while I do belong to the earth, I wish to	485.89631596823875
speak of you—of our friends.”	439.6675293019545
“And on my part,” said D’Artagnan, “I wished to speak of you, but I	337.0677502086447
find you so completely detached from everything! To love you cry, ‘Fie!	294.4229679130058
Friends are shadows! The world is a sepulcher!’”	418.98120003637473
“Alas, you will find it so yourself,” said Aramis, with a sigh.	315.0436115041641
“Well, then, let us say no more about it,” said D’Artagnan; “and let us	444.3786614011993
burn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh	409.8008831832119
infidelity of your _grisette_ or your chambermaid.”	322.20690191044844
“What letter?” cried Aramis, eagerly.	405.1888654916148
“A letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was	487.51319131252137
given to me for you.”	301.6968296232012
“But from whom is that letter?”	396.20758640334367
“Oh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding _grisette;_	298.38993713070806
from Madame de Chevreuse’s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to	448.9401541678257
return to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart	339.9904060836683
and attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a	442.6261803899249
duchess’s coronet.”	313.6036222786407
“What do you say?”	335.1082729221558
“Hold! I must have lost it,” said the young man maliciously, pretending	338.8817379546369
to search for it. “But fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men,	489.23047502825455
and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to	385.82094355369014
which you cry, ‘Fie! Fie!’”	384.21065976993737
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan,” cried Aramis, “you are killing me!”	413.35478161416756
“Well, here it is at last!” said D’Artagnan, as he drew the letter from	367.1350581509512
his pocket.	344.8403293350895
Aramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it,	468.236429983477
his countenance radiant.	322.9918782628117
“This same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style,” said the	336.428478505308
messenger, carelessly.	463.57764504937796
“Thanks, D’Artagnan, thanks!” cried Aramis, almost in a state of	455.71795759246766
delirium. “She was forced to return to Tours; she is not faithless; she	391.74972700363827
still loves me! Come, my friend, come, let me embrace you. Happiness	395.8455162190898
almost stifles me!”	467.2282059311998
The two friends began to dance around the venerable St. Chrysostom,	438.7616115756209
kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis, which had fallen on	349.42609284475947
the floor.	481.4951814213912
At that moment Bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet.	465.9733580147743
“Be off, you wretch!” cried Aramis, throwing his skullcap in his face.	360.98705211942683
“Return whence you came; take back those horrible vegetables, and that	372.4232693236531
poor kickshaw! Order a larded hare, a fat capon, mutton leg dressed	439.2763843704332
with garlic, and four bottles of old Burgundy.”	471.21483110395536
Bazin, who looked at his master, without comprehending the cause of	331.3919916233368
this change, in a melancholy manner, allowed the omelet to slip into	371.1324762142274
the spinach, and the spinach onto the floor.	446.60026403763163
“Now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the King of	413.2068624362586
kings,” said D’Artagnan, “if you persist in offering him a civility.	345.61174162912965
_Non inutile desiderium oblatione_.”	466.85755648640566
“Go to the devil with your Latin. Let us drink, my dear D’Artagnan,	386.8748660326614
_morbleu!_ Let us drink while the wine is fresh! Let us drink heartily,	460.57718127496156
and while we do so, tell me a little of what is going on in the world	413.60237813833345
yonder.”	411.58991265379694
Chapter XXVII.	457.6603463176225
THE WIFE OF ATHOS	447.17934494841006
We have now to search for Athos,” said D’Artagnan to the vivacious	469.36031970754243
Aramis, when he had informed him of all that had passed since their	469.1123772586778
departure from the capital, and an excellent dinner had made one of	391.1238453786658
them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue.	302.9905809057265
“Do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?” asked	486.60883890552475
Aramis. “Athos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so	461.7983087978738
skillfully.”	398.2806695774809
“No doubt. Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of	307.6742163833442
Athos than I have; but I like better to hear my sword clang against	491.8288404938403
lances than against staves. I fear lest Athos should have been beaten	341.8007476050805
down by serving men. Those fellows strike hard, and don’t leave off in	349.4040607206817
a hurry. This is why I wish to set out again as soon as possible.”	476.79963380893764
“I will try to accompany you,” said Aramis, “though I scarcely feel in	452.88305557673505
a condition to mount on horseback. Yesterday I undertook to employ that	459.6649284711208
cord which you see hanging against the wall, but pain prevented my	316.8881555740124
continuing the pious exercise.”	382.77720416680575
“That’s the first time I ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot	347.07576872558155
wounds with cat-o’-nine-tails; but you were ill, and illness renders	376.4671404580804
the head weak, therefore you may be excused.”	410.5180148391275
“When do you mean to set out?”	315.415417496624
“Tomorrow at daybreak. Sleep as soundly as you can tonight, and	357.0389646383686
tomorrow, if you can, we will take our departure together.”	452.3271702272202
“Till tomorrow, then,” said Aramis; “for iron-nerved as you are, you	299.75688270793376
must need repose.”	471.1975672944732
The next morning, when D’Artagnan entered Aramis’s chamber, he found	382.2596776556149
him at the window.	310.6010477755767
“What are you looking at?” asked D’Artagnan.	387.1618209350577
“My faith! I am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys	481.72429900804485
are leading about. It would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel	394.22509589501794
upon such horses.”	338.8694248558355
“Well, my dear Aramis, you may enjoy that pleasure, for one of those	465.6351835032936
three horses is yours.”	292.2729013366228
“Ah, bah! Which?”	457.86754656608355
“Whichever of the three you like, I have no preference.”	372.1225107208093
“And the rich caparison, is that mine, too?”	423.85807183323243
“Without doubt.”	384.2699691212911
“You laugh, D’Artagnan.”	443.0350265944154
“No, I have left off laughing, now that you speak French.”	411.4451458463127
“What, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded	465.4025037964382
with silver—are they all for me?”	357.3037026325734
“For you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine,	349.26043331822586
and the other horse, which is caracoling, belongs to Athos.”	447.3519415405929
“_Peste!_ They are three superb animals!”	473.5205606173994
“I am glad they please you.”	322.46060173724766
“Why, it must have been the king who made you such a present.”	466.64167220807224
“Certainly it was not the cardinal; but don’t trouble yourself whence	312.8759135727344
they come, think only that one of the three is your property.”	316.6373590724942
“I choose that which the red-headed boy is leading.”	410.56162781536926
“It is yours!”	317.1881919381995
“Good heaven! That is enough to drive away all my pains; I could mount	444.3785048052325
him with thirty balls in my body. On my soul, handsome stirrups!	354.04381655935344
_Holà_, Bazin, come here this minute.”	443.2340363203927
Bazin appeared on the threshold, dull and spiritless.	387.234542131379
“That last order is useless,” interrupted D’Artagnan; “there are loaded	415.4184482850228
pistols in your holsters.”	452.99431419687926
Bazin sighed.	296.9150630229227
“Come, Monsieur Bazin, make yourself easy,” said D’Artagnan; “people of	447.7445850164635
all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven.”	433.40373706325903
“Monsieur was already such a good theologian,” said Bazin, almost	334.3988758137769
weeping; “he might have become a bishop, and perhaps a cardinal.”	421.47210900253333
“Well, but my poor Bazin, reflect a little. Of what use is it to be a	349.0178583885849
churchman, pray? You do not avoid going to war by that means; you see,	308.2276270576171
the cardinal is about to make the next campaign, helm on head and	448.22925893747276
partisan in hand. And Monsieur de Nogaret de la Valette, what do you	413.7941163933346
say of him? He is a cardinal likewise. Ask his lackey how often he has	335.75119618458564
had to prepare lint of him.”	337.3231086098906
“Alas!” sighed Bazin. “I know it, monsieur; everything is turned	327.00376474287816
topsy-turvy in the world nowadays.”	360.7231411928767
While this dialogue was going on, the two young men and the poor lackey	375.5583358462175
descended.	483.53853453146587
“Hold my stirrup, Bazin,” cried Aramis; and Aramis sprang into the	430.8421955560956
saddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults and	480.50193776950664
curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so	346.3918393008236
insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.	389.9669180275513
D’Artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,	327.1912330887738
sprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his	454.2672511419347
chamber.	469.97650220995683
“That’s all right, my dear Aramis, take care of yourself,” said he; “I	328.3829446152657
will go alone in search of Athos.”	324.6121937605701
“You are a man of brass,” replied Aramis.	340.2469211589198
“No, I have good luck, that is all. But how do you mean to pass your	363.50002958884215
time till I come back? No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers	313.6003433141288
or upon benedictions, hey?”	326.3900315270582
Aramis smiled. “I will make verses,” said he.	462.5757134929296
“Yes, I dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the	298.73022632288485
attendant of Madame de Chevreuse. Teach Bazin prosody; that will	421.119696703719
console him. As to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that	404.1902875059772
will accustom you to his maneuvers.”	397.6796743134595
“Oh, make yourself easy on that head,” replied Aramis. “You will find	448.14880489858984
me ready to follow you.”	340.6798094858698
They took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having	401.970468165218
commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin, D’Artagnan	481.8889026787983
was trotting along in the direction of Amiens.	405.81402684592416
How was he going to find Athos? Should he find him at all? The position	301.61838912222265
in which he had left him was critical. He probably had succumbed. This	358.2096601317208
idea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused	308.8163070715969
him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. Of all his	299.9595013146094
friends, Athos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in	365.09271587160777
appearance, in his tastes and sympathies.	321.30702797613793
Yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. The noble	483.700018641939
and distinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from	396.54577396740007
time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept	352.2434369187225
himself, that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most	296.597938068953
pleasant companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that	467.7541569964539
bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the	404.42958101622037
result of the rarest coolness—such qualities attracted more than the	326.3308522827043
esteem, more than the friendship of D’Artagnan; they attracted his	392.4186270158909
admiration.	440.7315062378083
Indeed, when placed beside M. de Tréville, the elegant and noble	398.8666822358625
courtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain	326.7782815047366
a comparison. He was of middle height; but his person was so admirably	319.26699513536266
shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles	371.60647100167665
with Porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was	458.03043304350524
proverbial among the Musketeers. His head, with piercing eyes, a	307.2603195391197
straight nose, a chin cut like that of Brutus, had altogether an	352.8230089822672
indefinable character of grandeur and grace. His hands, of which he	313.01737149552554
took little care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with	462.95707972753854
almond paste and perfumed oil. The sound of his voice was at once	384.4683623834012
penetrating and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in	316.6278043863422
Athos, who was always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the	475.0148006498793
world and of the usages of the most brilliant society—those manners of	425.91111568804394
a high degree which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his	346.808819108815
least actions.	443.2606742810445
If a repast were on foot, Athos presided over it better than any other,	454.60305845363115
placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned	311.5779341531432
for him or that he had made for himself. If a question in heraldry were	422.059334324058
started, Athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom, their	442.19429125984345
genealogy, their alliances, their coats of arms, and the origin of	414.8300118966068
them. Etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him. He knew what were the	368.8082739017131
rights of the great land owners. He was profoundly versed in hunting	430.843246781542
and falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art	329.0419105239281
astonished even Louis XIII. himself, who took a pride in being	338.5684596572854
considered a past master therein.	401.18914678104034
Like all the great nobles of that period, Athos rode and fenced to	416.3329930719519
perfection. But still further, his education had been so little	456.3993892156115
neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this	406.0706334543551
time among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which	468.65873340777773
Aramis sported and which Porthos pretended to understand. Two or three	390.9256231582536
times, even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when	294.1574866760325
Aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in	408.58540389975275
its right tense and a noun in its case. Besides, his probity was	483.8646260566278
irreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with	292.18201741108396
their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy	347.98702014973566
of our era, and the poor with God’s Seventh Commandment. This Athos,	454.03251759202834
then, was a very extraordinary man.	413.6454121093773
And yet this nature so distinguished, this creature so beautiful, this	388.1038635142686
essence so fine, was seen to turn insensibly toward material life, as	373.1072121244239
old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility. Athos, in his hours	479.62489251701436
of gloom—and these hours were frequent—was extinguished as to the whole	427.0036686391678
of the luminous portion of him, and his brilliant side disappeared as	475.3351966619787
into profound darkness.	453.02119731714663
Then the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man. His head hanging	345.0933775287073
down, his eye dull, his speech slow and painful, Athos would look for	467.4685297150661
hours together at his bottle, his glass, or at Grimaud, who, accustomed	488.5835195545237
to obey him by signs, read in the faint glance of his master his least	341.88386086887266
desire, and satisfied it immediately. If the four friends were	473.22999014079915
assembled at one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally	323.3986881276832
with a violent effort, was the share Athos furnished to the	358.1142131309148
conversation. In exchange for his silence Athos drank enough for four,	393.13788585591226
and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more	294.8455507202061
marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.	462.28790352473123
D’Artagnan, whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with, had	384.7883038395148
not—whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this	300.657210191048
subject—been able to assign any cause for these fits, or for the	373.8347337267557
periods of their recurrence. Athos never received any letters; Athos	483.0967705306191
never had concerns which all his friends did not know.	341.17953927111853
It could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for	378.87825127529123
in truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as	477.9981595353232
we have said, rendered still darker. This excess of bilious humor could	398.75362662145255
not be attributed to play; for unlike Porthos, who accompanied the	325.60850811675044
variations of chance with songs or oaths, Athos when he won remained as	371.9714428041749
unmoved as when he lost. He had been known, in the circle of the	437.8108593703224
Musketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them	312.2449368970163
even to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again	393.7488608456116
with the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow	418.9773451837317
being heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their	394.7740994276996
pearly hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening,	318.6355858693824
ceasing to be calm and agreeable.	460.3437832142539
Neither was it, as with our neighbors, the English, an atmospheric	309.4263481779505
influence which darkened his countenance; for the sadness generally	335.3753014370075
became more intense toward the fine season of the year. June and July	339.6298786416412
were the terrible months with Athos.	399.07958332958884
For the present he had no anxiety. He shrugged his shoulders when	473.9369775249445
people spoke of the future. His secret, then, was in the past, as had	482.35361721505456
often been vaguely said to D’Artagnan.	356.27906630676335
This mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still	436.6336559373644
more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete	294.0296890707789
intoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions	414.98226968130456
had been put to him.	374.6256827146782
“Well,” thought D’Artagnan, “poor Athos is perhaps at this moment dead,	462.8919464430335
and dead by my fault—for it was I who dragged him into this affair, of	327.4046798711285
which he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the	310.99256387227825
result, and from which he can derive no advantage.”	379.11398486592634
“Without reckoning, monsieur,” added Planchet to his master’s audibly	432.7853582428902
expressed reflections, “that we perhaps owe our lives to him. Do you	463.56196769930307
remember how he cried, ‘On, D’Artagnan, on, I am taken’? And when he	362.71662721419733
had discharged his two pistols, what a terrible noise he made with his	491.8306712302747
sword! One might have said that twenty men, or rather twenty mad	296.3186679799687
devils, were fighting.”	429.72456685908134
These words redoubled the eagerness of D’Artagnan, who urged his horse,	474.39063235352796
though he stood in need of no incitement, and they proceeded at a rapid	334.4475245260309
pace. About eleven o’clock in the morning they perceived Amiens, and at	309.97943372438885
half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn.	335.22589983607855
D’Artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those	480.3301717488795
hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for. He	391.96560427664343
entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes, his left hand	430.0751775312515
on the pommel of the sword, and cracking his whip with his right hand.	479.1899929911181
“Do you remember me?” said he to the host, who advanced to greet him.	309.70662119627724
“I have not that honor, monseigneur,” replied the latter, his eyes	461.18155289195954
dazzled by the brilliant style in which D’Artagnan traveled.	470.89157081496637
“What, you don’t know me?”	331.0432595242685
“No, monseigneur.”	482.83586777140545
“Well, two words will refresh your memory. What have you done with that	478.54909896070944
gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to	436.8524058623698
make an accusation of passing false money?”	387.8556240361461
The host became as pale as death; for D’Artagnan had assumed a	414.68761092590364
threatening attitude, and Planchet modeled himself after his master.	491.07095161787277
“Ah, monseigneur, do not mention it!” cried the host, in the most	429.3770140576078
pitiable voice imaginable. “Ah, monseigneur, how dearly have I paid for	451.72092093258607
that fault, unhappy wretch as I am!”	454.18385036276845
“That gentleman, I say, what has become of him?”	362.03102166983393
“Deign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful! Sit down, in	328.74432675045546
mercy!”	331.1048049238947
D’Artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening	350.6010983705029
attitude of a judge. Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his	408.48580224836587
armchair.	469.63830614114136
“Here is the story, monseigneur,” resumed the trembling host; “for I	299.68668444639314
now recollect you. It was you who rode off at the moment I had that	377.84302844924986
unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of.”	313.6992572231715
“Yes, it was I; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to	348.35718127516856
expect if you do not tell me the whole truth.”	332.772874933679
“Condescend to listen to me, and you shall know all.”	451.54856499222973
“I listen.”	430.80116540589074
“I had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad	315.42507758540194
money would arrive at my inn, with several of his companions, all	293.2785283062423
disguised as Guards or Musketeers. Monseigneur, I was furnished with a	418.5372033570913
description of your horses, your lackeys, your countenances—nothing was	350.09954784922513
omitted.”	355.3953680003543
“Go on, go on!” said D’Artagnan, who quickly understood whence such an	392.64106231288656
exact description had come.	301.6719872433725
“I took then, in conformity with the orders of the authorities, who	394.94354355049614
sent me a reinforcement of six men, such measures as I thought	397.2728662494646
necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners.”	468.1576808791739
“Again!” said D’Artagnan, whose ears chafed terribly under the	391.3457064446593
repetition of this word _coiners_.	490.7030249101724
“Pardon me, monseigneur, for saying such things, but they form my	480.67371593907706
excuse. The authorities had terrified me, and you know that an	330.94671157573
innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities.”	436.9823252355093
“But once again, that gentleman—where is he? What has become of him? Is	344.69565355263506
he dead? Is he living?”	411.12926319243684
“Patience, monseigneur, we are coming to it. There happened then that	413.5881716264215
which you know, and of which your precipitate departure,” added the	366.29437006885996
host, with an acuteness that did not escape D’Artagnan, “appeared to	311.06008553388443
authorize the issue. That gentleman, your friend, defended himself	413.385316101045
desperately. His lackey, who, by an unforeseen piece of ill luck, had	490.1604312214696
quarreled with the officers, disguised as stable lads—”	390.2641662060867
“Miserable scoundrel!” cried D’Artagnan, “you were all in the plot,	333.1286374758095
then! And I really don’t know what prevents me from exterminating you	306.684738916881
all.”	489.6299609275686
“Alas, monseigneur, we were not in the plot, as you will soon see.	431.7563434764338
Monsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name	430.55729865002615
which no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), Monsieur your	343.82787771034344
friend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting	354.3679273044094
with his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me	318.1469792067778
with a blow of the flat side of it.”	390.8398800752217
“You villain, will you finish?” cried D’Artagnan, “Athos—what has	449.26640244004557
become of Athos?”	299.3519969517207
“While fighting and retreating, as I have told Monseigneur, he found	443.3992004031784
the door of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he	367.03734428344615
took out the key, and barricaded himself inside. As we were sure of	486.26173106946396
finding him there, we left him alone.”	294.69527861814123
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “you did not really wish to kill; you only	474.78565518774155
wished to imprison him.”	477.92722211527064
“Good God! To imprison him, monseigneur? Why, he imprisoned himself, I	321.59017168029885
swear to you he did. In the first place he had made rough work of it;	293.1724516587001
one man was killed on the spot, and two others were severely wounded.	309.43483259926296
The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades,	396.6783488513584
and I have heard nothing of either of them since. As for myself, as	370.38694866444496
soon as I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor, to whom	361.5080871313816
I related all that had passed, and asked, what I should do with my	349.377944556587
prisoner. Monsieur the Governor was all astonishment. He told me he	384.4180232182565
knew nothing about the matter, that the orders I had received did not	452.61471102583994
come from him, and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as	451.4265209731315
being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged. It appears	357.5449163768756
that I had made a mistake, monsieur, that I had arrested the wrong	317.34662795535945
person, and that he whom I ought to have arrested had escaped.”	306.57171603971995
“But Athos!” cried D’Artagnan, whose impatience was increased by the	467.5350544727496
disregard of the authorities, “Athos, where is he?”	418.2140132688036
“As I was anxious to repair the wrongs I had done the prisoner,”	374.0835171872874
resumed the innkeeper, “I took my way straight to the cellar in order	411.20276687266863
to set him at liberty. Ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a	410.3047056033322
devil! To my offer of liberty, he replied that it was nothing but a	437.76073874863744
snare, and that before he came out he intended to impose his own	359.43328829445363
conditions. I told him very humbly—for I could not conceal from myself	485.1424685308467
the scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majesty’s	404.7760987808621
Musketeers—I told him I was quite ready to submit to his conditions.	342.21916522624207
“‘In the first place,’ said he, ‘I wish my lackey placed with me, fully	432.5766755023913
armed.’ We hastened to obey this order; for you will please to	373.094627880237
understand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend	385.9587541558962
could desire. Monsieur Grimaud (he told us his name, although he does	352.04132666040215
not talk much)—Monsieur Grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded	466.80401953973455
as he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door	403.19982099428535
afresh, and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar.”	487.6137898242695
“But where is Athos now?” cried D’Artagnan. “Where is Athos?”	420.40370710447723
“In the cellar, monsieur.”	402.6829690000573
“What, you scoundrel! Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?”	299.91382023112106
“Merciful heaven! No, monsieur! We keep him in the cellar! You do not	401.1477609649771
know what he is about in the cellar. Ah! If you could but persuade him	371.1881871569108
to come out, monsieur, I should owe you the gratitude of my whole life;	459.1393442444504
I should adore you as my patron saint!”	478.2484229403972
“Then he is there? I shall find him there?”	456.1904267733058
“Without doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remaining there. We	474.5444482928459
every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork,	373.06870490772747
and some meat when he asks for it; but alas! It is not of bread and	366.28194559074336
meat of which he makes the greatest consumption. I once endeavored to	327.8786376665975
go down with two of my servants; but he flew into terrible rage. I	323.62813781616956
heard the noise he made in loading his pistols, and his servant in	472.0405511481573
loading his musketoon. Then, when we asked them what were their	432.83283258245194
intentions, the master replied that he had forty charges to fire, and	341.2596633270962
that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow	461.1914846433781
a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar. Upon this I went and	342.348639001748
complained to the governor, who replied that I only had what I	317.7691355734301
deserved, and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who	295.60247069634073
took up their abode in my house.”	375.860776490062
“So that since that time—” replied D’Artagnan, totally unable to	378.65046848523247
refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host.	437.3939156284152
“So from that time, monsieur,” continued the latter, “we have led the	297.5596516184068
most miserable life imaginable; for you must know, monsieur, that all	314.32886587972087
our provisions are in the cellar. There is our wine in bottles, and our	367.5290775144771
wine in casks; the beer, the oil, and the spices, the bacon, and	295.0699806985577
sausages. And as we are prevented from going down there, we are forced	301.7490005423445
to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house; so	361.8183199337973
that our hostelry is daily going to ruin. If your friend remains	384.2629869567871
another week in my cellar I shall be a ruined man.”	310.47476157829965
“And not more than justice, either, you ass! Could you not perceive by	444.3413947141121
our appearance that we were people of quality, and not coiners—say?”	313.623083105602
“Yes, monsieur, you are right,” said the host. “But, hark, hark! There	323.85538909423644
he is!”	476.7204401918881
“Somebody has disturbed him, without doubt,” said D’Artagnan.	363.33382067651183
“But he must be disturbed,” cried the host; “Here are two English	342.856355304046
gentlemen just arrived.”	309.1897939926161
“Well?”	405.023840513813
“Well, the English like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these	449.2002670304375
have asked for the best. My wife has perhaps requested permission of	294.7791038857569
Monsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and	353.86884213818087
he, as usual, has refused. Ah, good heaven! There is the hullabaloo	476.7794831380535
louder than ever!”	467.9475846776716
D’Artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar.	418.21542818993777
He rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by	345.4190062375242
Planchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of	422.725831748278
action.	473.2156101357331
The two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were	324.6732924685326
dying with hunger and thirst.	325.86235440567305
“But this is tyranny!” cried one of them, in very good French, though	472.4439453922198
with a foreign accent, “that this madman will not allow these good	482.6699540718819
people access to their own wine! Nonsense, let us break open the door,	294.76764640701055
and if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!”	405.14503654748
“Softly, gentlemen!” said D’Artagnan, drawing his pistols from his	312.83991904450426
belt, “you will kill nobody, if you please!”	451.2400547629454
“Good, good!” cried the calm voice of Athos, from the other side of the	378.39695349998374
door, “let them just come in, these devourers of little children, and	312.8939284401358
we shall see!”	391.2316117362736
Brave as they appeared to be, the two English gentlemen looked at each	401.16043909673203
other hesitatingly. One might have thought there was in that cellar one	398.1187910542481
of those famished ogres—the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into	364.23684556329056
whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.	488.1680870306478
There was a moment of silence; but at length the two Englishmen felt	339.9988617002818
ashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six	454.49582427272907
steps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough	469.2261261368091
to split a wall.	419.21159302738045
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, cocking his pistols, “I will take charge	490.6648838363302
of the one at the top; you look to the one below. Ah, gentlemen, you	487.5776440317868
want battle; and you shall have it.”	327.1493286454907
“Good God!” cried the hollow voice of Athos, “I can hear D’Artagnan, I	392.63853825614393
think.”	306.0537186725966
“Yes,” cried D’Artagnan, raising his voice in turn, “I am here, my	433.78339946851014
friend.”	440.4026781656628
“Ah, good, then,” replied Athos, “we will teach them, these door	362.437236557285
breakers!”	303.53286752897094
The gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken	440.15620224211324
between two fires. They still hesitated an instant; but, as before,	306.04485379279186
pride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.	309.7459081911452
“Stand on one side, D’Artagnan, stand on one side,” cried Athos. “I am	347.94370415923737
going to fire!”	471.08894390802647
“Gentlemen,” exclaimed D’Artagnan, whom reflection never abandoned,	438.00093947969174
“gentlemen, think of what you are about. Patience, Athos! You are	294.20676567470775
running your heads into a very silly affair; you will be riddled. My	359.15101533070083
lackey and I will have three shots at you, and you will get as many	330.60073757301063
from the cellar. You will then have our swords, with which, I can	450.4290720797136
assure you, my friend and I can play tolerably well. Let me conduct	478.9628320155805
your business and my own. You shall soon have something to drink; I	474.57382492326917
give you my word.”	347.6621037107188
“If there is any left,” grumbled the jeering voice of Athos.	309.4979238161614
The host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.	440.6928209683522
“How! ‘If there is any left!’” murmured he.	302.5398842728266
“What the devil! There must be plenty left,” replied D’Artagnan. “Be	395.7903753479768
satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.	321.01165478831285
Gentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards.”	392.65108464166565
“Well, provided you replace your pistols in your belt.”	388.0515722707514
“Willingly.”	489.99490286105
And D’Artagnan set the example. Then, turning toward Planchet, he made	431.64217088714975
him a sign to uncock his musketoon.	338.6506965544203
The Englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their	385.5246194662003
swords grumblingly. The history of Athos’s imprisonment was then	483.3069657396503
related to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the	339.1736799575986
host in the wrong.	304.75809255461814
“Now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “go up to your room again; and in	473.1399336917181
ten minutes, I will answer for it, you shall have all you desire.”	304.9619011856695
The Englishmen bowed and went upstairs.	345.284195300086
“Now I am alone, my dear Athos,” said D’Artagnan; “open the door, I beg	324.1121120319802
of you.”	357.4382930802547
“Instantly,” said Athos.	308.5915916252416
Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the	292.41832661436365
groaning of posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos,	312.1475814857895
which the besieged himself demolished.	294.7787822558311
An instant after, the broken door was removed, and the pale face of	479.5638203502075
Athos appeared, who with a rapid glance took a survey of the	377.4685595761024
surroundings.	460.1238985291408
D’Artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly. He then	338.6367778261711
tried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he	436.32280889902927
perceived that Athos staggered.	488.97360386154435
“You are wounded,” said he.	484.29015893102064
“I! Not at all. I am dead drunk, that’s all, and never did a man more	339.34320772061204
strongly set about getting so. By the Lord, my good host! I must at	338.7356384225651
least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles.”	460.443658276613
“Mercy!” cried the host, “if the lackey has drunk only half as much as	418.631336821437
the master, I am a ruined man.”	462.26864500562965
“Grimaud is a well-bred lackey. He would never think of faring in the	488.0800995408963
same manner as his master; he only drank from the cask. Hark! I don’t	355.1274461798825
think he put the faucet in again. Do you hear it? It is running now.”	399.4929659293114
D’Artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into	298.6305445929824
a burning fever.	305.88280074226014
In the meantime, Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master, with	476.4887067051385
the musketoon on his shoulder, and his head shaking. Like one of those	328.1798904436952
drunken satyrs in the pictures of Rubens. He was moistened before and	407.2545801760573
behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive	375.6311188926139
oil.	324.8537668353585
The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of	393.02982561960147
the best apartment in the house, which D’Artagnan occupied with	381.70033049689675
authority.	301.7630710466747
In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the	428.7804136531287
cellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a	334.99498337150305
frightful spectacle awaited them.	337.3902891867182
Beyond the fortifications through which Athos had made a breach in	430.1565373438784
order to get out, and which were composed of fagots, planks, and empty	425.0006071651651
casks, heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art, they	410.8927497758993
found, swimming in puddles of oil and wine, the bones and fragments of	449.3689121444945
all the hams they had eaten; while a heap of broken bottles filled the	363.5858719839564
whole left-hand corner of the cellar, and a tun, the cock of which was	359.0940996907548
left running, was yielding, by this means, the last drop of its blood.	366.7575553985535
“The image of devastation and death,” as the ancient poet says,	471.2302561962941
“reigned as over a field of battle.”	367.6945358449542
Of fifty large sausages, suspended from the joists, scarcely ten	451.7799616111767
remained.	455.61037444803753
Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the	356.35426090145893
cellar. D’Artagnan himself was moved by them. Athos did not even turn	434.0054732317767
his head.	481.7843383334467
To grief succeeded rage. The host armed himself with a spit, and rushed	488.8600133024397
into the chamber occupied by the two friends.	362.0320162898821
“Some wine!” said Athos, on perceiving the host.	308.16484914239265
“Some wine!” cried the stupefied host, “some wine? Why you have drunk	479.5658306792301
more than a hundred pistoles’ worth! I am a ruined man, lost,	481.2041994536147
destroyed!”	444.02650712425566
“Bah,” said Athos, “we were always dry.”	473.7050699133289
“If you had been contented with drinking, well and good; but you have	426.0577129572769
broken all the bottles.”	481.8355442248179
“You pushed me upon a heap which rolled down. That was your fault.”	427.5023037234468
“All my oil is lost!”	320.3896003769127
“Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor Grimaud here was	342.150832739435
obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him.”	454.7012380368375
“All my sausages are gnawed!”	360.8870562200897
“There is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar.”	435.17809643207147
“You shall pay me for all this,” cried the exasperated host.	473.4004000127628
“Triple ass!” said Athos, rising; but he sank down again immediately.	403.17009553835265
He had tried his strength to the utmost. D’Artagnan came to his relief	447.13628857997
with his whip in his hand.	390.05701489320904
The host drew back and burst into tears.	304.94186649557196
“This will teach you,” said D’Artagnan, “to treat the guests God sends	326.3252517264685
you in a more courteous fashion.”	481.77540789544327
“God? Say the devil!”	338.94933645886493
“My dear friend,” said D’Artagnan, “if you annoy us in this manner we	346.3551443709481
will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see	402.91438965901386
if the mischief is as great as you say.”	357.3334247048979
“Oh, gentlemen,” said the host, “I have been wrong. I confess it, but	434.12444878675456
pardon to every sin! You are gentlemen, and I am a poor innkeeper. You	379.32200413296107
will have pity on me.”	406.41971391782124
“Ah, if you speak in that way,” said Athos, “you will break my heart,	430.5475379951387
and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.	402.0721881964286
We are not such devils as we appear to be. Come hither, and let us	367.41575374508403
talk.”	308.46507791586225
The host approached with hesitation.	390.323082102026
“Come hither, I say, and don’t be afraid,” continued Athos. “At the	390.1166432822504
very moment when I was about to pay you, I had placed my purse on the	430.66747265902063
table.”	423.206446853891
“Yes, monsieur.”	425.65312531361076
“That purse contained sixty pistoles; where is it?”	361.9578906079713
“Deposited with the justice; they said it was bad money.”	443.0024438760198
“Very well; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles.”	292.8682876529986
“But Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which	452.607181830781
it once lays hold of. If it were bad money, there might be some hopes;	399.9583234827702
but unfortunately, those were all good pieces.”	460.21040590127524
“Manage the matter as well as you can, my good man; it does not concern	425.6853757070289
me, the more so as I have not a livre left.”	299.51436259783696
“Come,” said D’Artagnan, “let us inquire further. Athos’s horse, where	388.377432282371
is that?”	460.55470082773013
“In the stable.”	489.2737015583508
“How much is it worth?”	292.0757879918061
“Fifty pistoles at most.”	300.85791569153685
“It’s worth eighty. Take it, and there ends the matter.”	468.0484958522693
“What,” cried Athos, “are you selling my horse—my Bajazet? And pray	367.1330224429604
upon what shall I make my campaign; upon Grimaud?”	428.80389958233434
“I have brought you another,” said D’Artagnan.	462.3967794394026
“Another?”	355.45755862950045
“And a magnificent one!” cried the host.	362.4971156730808
“Well, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the	480.4959589298401
old one; and let us drink.”	334.1148493490624
“What?” asked the host, quite cheerful again.	379.74428641081647
“Some of that at the bottom, near the laths. There are twenty-five	322.7509598072879
bottles of it left; all the rest were broken by my fall. Bring six of	466.7856449902318
them.”	362.9773168844996
“Why, this man is a cask!” said the host, aside. “If he only remains	444.4583097229493
here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, I shall soon	361.37182852446597
re-establish my business.”	404.35467151447534
“And don’t forget,” said D’Artagnan, “to bring up four bottles of the	489.08857611800966
same sort for the two English gentlemen.”	370.04210069850734
“And now,” said Athos, “while they bring the wine, tell me, D’Artagnan,	306.52448871527747
what has become of the others, come!”	462.40983147570455
D’Artagnan related how he had found Porthos in bed with a strained	432.1351400755081
knee, and Aramis at a table between two theologians. As he finished,	330.6059352298586
the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for	386.05818228204276
him, had been left out of the cellar.	474.9876956299822
“That’s well!” said Athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;	445.5810108514281
“here’s to Porthos and Aramis! But you, D’Artagnan, what is the matter	384.1546686847134
with you, and what has happened to you personally? You have a sad air.”	442.31858644987625
“Alas,” said D’Artagnan, “it is because I am the most unfortunate.”	341.55014751329935
“Tell me.”	306.34721721799144
“Presently,” said D’Artagnan.	418.178965970063
“Presently! And why presently? Because you think I am drunk?	355.93393636657805
D’Artagnan, remember this! My ideas are never so clear as when I have	359.9262195480772
had plenty of wine. Speak, then, I am all ears.”	337.31641705984526
D’Artagnan related his adventure with Mme. Bonacieux. Athos listened to	343.9450538091986
him without a frown; and when he had finished, said, “Trifles, only	387.11827658398283
trifles!” That was his favorite word.	487.18010674367326
“You always say _trifles_, my dear Athos!” said D’Artagnan, “and that	348.84979178533393
comes very ill from you, who have never loved.”	361.76397787165996
The drink-deadened eye of Athos flashed out, but only for a moment; it	403.1880120933123
became as dull and vacant as before.	398.7849190628048
“That’s true,” said he, quietly, “for my part I have never loved.”	393.85806806721195
“Acknowledge, then, you stony heart,” said D’Artagnan, “that you are	319.4557891309183
wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts.”	472.01208635363923
“Tender hearts! Pierced hearts!” said Athos.	394.63398662304985
“What do you say?”	475.2433312676925
“I say that love is a lottery in which he who wins, wins death! You are	443.9137854102541
very fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear D’Artagnan. And if I	408.3284518517252
have any counsel to give, it is, always lose!”	295.2769796306962
“She seemed to love me so!”	351.73855865736334
“She _seemed_, did she?”	363.12587728905254
“Oh, she _did_ love me!”	337.11997467126787
“You child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,	350.6996822950109
that his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been	450.21394019737204
deceived by his mistress.”	425.0938588868415
“Except you, Athos, who never had one.”	294.51311017109555
“That’s true,” said Athos, after a moment’s silence, “that’s true! I	385.65488745322773
never had one! Let us drink!”	301.60145817434017
“But then, philosopher that you are,” said D’Artagnan, “instruct me,	378.8611993110258
support me. I stand in need of being taught and consoled.”	384.7366314581392
“Consoled for what?”	469.8208368845468
“For my misfortune.”	414.5783788745414
“Your misfortune is laughable,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; “I	416.8560264949649
should like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a	392.090170996133
real tale of love!”	449.732844394989
“Which has happened to you?”	335.34893727641776
“Or one of my friends, what matters?”	410.795760379703
“Tell it, Athos, tell it.”	293.46835063245913
“Better if I drink.”	324.3764672895778
“Drink and relate, then.”	304.00945987542525
“Not a bad idea!” said Athos, emptying and refilling his glass. “The	331.3262757276349
two things agree marvelously well.”	403.2059406246696
“I am all attention,” said D’Artagnan.	337.3989788352868
Athos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, D’Artagnan saw	379.3527291979751
that he became pale. He was at that period of intoxication in which	334.95493510965184
vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep. He kept himself	312.5663900238303
upright and dreamed, without sleeping. This somnambulism of drunkenness	297.76635929895286
had something frightful in it.	295.2117969348439
“You particularly wish it?” asked he.	297.98075266783695
“I pray for it,” said D’Artagnan.	320.43070722868316
“Be it then as you desire. One of my friends—one of my friends, please	370.1404958987765
to observe, not myself,” said Athos, interrupting himself with a	318.05414245595506
melancholy smile, “one of the counts of my province—that is to say, of	376.32755345984907
Berry—noble as a Dandolo or a Montmorency, at twenty-five years of age	391.1283084024601
fell in love with a girl of sixteen, beautiful as fancy can paint.	401.0783373007406
Through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind, not of the	440.6550001280526
woman, but of the poet. She did not please; she intoxicated. She lived	414.5430276581382
in a small town with her brother, who was a curate. Both had recently	375.15058266624476
come into the country. They came nobody knew whence; but when seeing	323.6215273036588
her so lovely and her brother so pious, nobody thought of asking whence	413.93665985096106
they came. They were said, however, to be of good extraction. My	334.7050426398193
friend, who was seigneur of the country, might have seduced her, or	464.45417452207795
taken her by force, at his will—for he was master. Who would have come	297.21229920356967
to the assistance of two strangers, two unknown persons? Unfortunately	454.0690158976274
he was an honorable man; he married her. The fool! The ass! The idiot!”	341.08419215663343
“How so, if he loved her?” asked D’Artagnan.	360.0483783808592
“Wait,” said Athos. “He took her to his château, and made her the first	395.22339286760786
lady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she	329.8786561047345
supported her rank becomingly.”	295.2106987794553
“Well?” asked D’Artagnan.	314.5361099635053
“Well, one day when she was hunting with her husband,” continued Athos,	436.7592465373765
in a low voice, and speaking very quickly, “she fell from her horse and	403.3423042077039
fainted. The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be	371.1271951764016
oppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in	480.49867615990206
so doing laid bare her shoulder. D’Artagnan,” said Athos, with a	311.59964478648317
maniacal burst of laughter, “guess what she had on her shoulder.”	395.9448827591511
“How can I tell?” said D’Artagnan.	434.9855177136466
“A _fleur-de-lis_,” said Athos. “She was branded.”	348.4593770915434
Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand.	357.53721892422413
“Horror!” cried D’Artagnan. “What do you tell me?”	480.83854099084033
“Truth, my friend. The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had	298.6683541512926
stolen the sacred vessels from a church.”	393.5310510943369
“And what did the count do?”	392.2835024051813
“The count was of the highest nobility. He had on his estates the	400.6614025825014
rights of high and low tribunals. He tore the dress of the countess to	349.7014587295207
pieces; he tied her hands behind her, and hanged her on a tree.”	473.90505451659897
“Heavens, Athos, a murder?” cried D’Artagnan.	458.4720172076229
“No less,” said Athos, as pale as a corpse. “But methinks I need wine!”	473.8777561978668
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his	351.6526423431488
mouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an	460.9861398259161
ordinary glass.	402.86120276981035
Then he let his head sink upon his two hands, while D’Artagnan stood	347.9852642777315
before him, stupefied.	462.3806669952272
“That has cured me of beautiful, poetical, and loving women,” said	294.6321370951081
Athos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting to	400.0085198899909
continue the fiction of the count. “God grant you as much! Let us	382.52849210366696
drink.”	425.6520994417182
“Then she is dead?” stammered D’Artagnan.	364.4624803738477
“_Parbleu!_” said Athos. “But hold out your glass. Some ham, my boy, or	372.9936657936534
we can’t drink.”	432.1918564977402
“And her brother?” added D’Artagnan, timidly.	425.94944256368046
“Her brother?” replied Athos.	379.8166562246656
“Yes, the priest.”	373.93208179386613
“Oh, I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise; but	347.2873078884564
he was beforehand with me, he had quit the curacy the night before.”	462.98726733144247
“Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?”	390.52277922737017
“He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady. A	408.1113194034331
worthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting	491.35316124443904
his mistress married, and securing her a position. He has been hanged	453.4360477165587
and quartered, I hope.”	405.60982597765474
“My God, my God!” cried D’Artagnan, quite stunned by the relation of	380.4426039070714
this horrible adventure.	351.37109642499655
“Taste some of this ham, D’Artagnan; it is exquisite,” said Athos,	467.4050867211216
cutting a slice, which he placed on the young man’s plate.	326.08666084174024
“What a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar. I	489.88853928429273
could have drunk fifty bottles more.”	401.7763591410041
D’Artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him	320.6428834129023
bewildered. Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands, he pretended	437.0952023309824
to sleep.	422.5710321968316
“These young fellows can none of them drink,” said Athos, looking at	386.684927176279
him with pity, “and yet this is one of the best!”	394.1475851581851
Chapter XXVIII.	299.07596832598347
THE RETURN	477.1820252804463
D’Artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos; yet many	307.21034810622666
things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation. In the	450.0158521107439
first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half	470.8463769730703
drunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or	332.286494384611
four bottles of Burgundy carries with it to the brain, D’Artagnan, when	363.5929700242652
awaking on the following morning, had all the words of Athos as present	456.6075625276087
to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth—they had been so	302.80832670603627
impressed upon his mind. All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively	471.750144937075
desire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend’s	309.1087332893178
chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the	406.56782536697324
preceding evening; but he found Athos quite himself again—that is to	417.2230149826399
say, the most shrewd and impenetrable of men. Besides which, the	307.8991042154483
Musketeer, after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him,	462.0677537670896
broached the matter first.	425.7923066347631
“I was pretty drunk yesterday, D’Artagnan,” said he, “I can tell that	409.28389392841717
by my tongue, which was swollen and hot this morning, and by my pulse,	322.65884402128654
which was very tremulous. I wager that I uttered a thousand	402.76466875093587
extravagances.”	367.8116587303801
While saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that	392.51833736080835
embarrassed him.	425.7824749787253
“No,” replied D’Artagnan, “if I recollect well what you said, it was	485.8682222324811
nothing out of the common way.”	440.17453292865923
“Ah, you surprise me. I thought I had told you a most lamentable	341.4028501587962
story.” And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom	473.22794245288003
of his heart.	340.31342689217166
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan, “it appears that I was more drunk than	381.3865970185466
you, since I remember nothing of the kind.”	429.0183976584276
Athos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; “you cannot have failed	454.31040671018286
to remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of	318.4944327923383
drunkenness, sad or gay. My drunkenness is always sad, and when I am	302.172537476509
thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which	381.8649499708021
my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain. That is my failing—a capital	377.64217350155553
failing, I admit; but with that exception, I am a good drinker.”	401.41935132623075
Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that D’Artagnan was shaken in	332.1570266385837
his conviction.	487.41115520985215
“It is that, then,” replied the young man, anxious to find out the	444.7412650058309
truth, “it is that, then, I remember as we remember a dream. We were	449.2688238425666
speaking of hanging.”	425.60857049674144
“Ah, you see how it is,” said Athos, becoming still paler, but yet	378.61690983032605
attempting to laugh; “I was sure it was so—the hanging of people is my	443.9764669548915
nightmare.”	479.05021061401396
“Yes, yes,” replied D’Artagnan. “I remember now; yes, it was about—stop	302.6297206626437
a minute—yes, it was about a woman.”	354.5340725852608
“That’s it,” replied Athos, becoming almost livid; “that is my grand	346.41040623679777
story of the fair lady, and when I relate that, I must be very drunk.”	478.5680800250983
“Yes, that was it,” said D’Artagnan, “the story of a tall, fair lady,	359.14844742883633
with blue eyes.”	407.71417317891644
“Yes, who was hanged.”	308.32942765118025
“By her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance,” continued	428.9573550962272
D’Artagnan, looking intently at Athos.	489.58490167165405
“Well, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know	438.0799977520313
what he says,” replied Athos, shrugging his shoulders as if he thought	336.6265317901373
himself an object of pity. “I certainly never will get drunk again,	489.97501054558825
D’Artagnan; it is too bad a habit.”	448.79859737259426
D’Artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at	308.40600190657847
once, Athos said:	407.73207808359166
“By the by, I thank you for the horse you have brought me.”	431.0996904896797
“Is it to your mind?” asked D’Artagnan.	456.6343113658437
“Yes; but it is not a horse for hard work.”	352.60755500710115
“You are mistaken; I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour	297.285656257698
and a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made	431.52506110509034
the tour of the Place St. Sulpice.”	438.6070132947816
“Ah, you begin to awaken my regret.”	437.60699437024005
“Regret?”	359.5980226255341
“Yes; I have parted with him.”	401.04008389883097
“How?”	331.6979808875572
“Why, here is the simple fact. This morning I awoke at six o’clock. You	367.331892759153
were still fast asleep, and I did not know what to do with myself; I	369.0728093750814
was still stupid from our yesterday’s debauch. As I came into the	409.41134260102444
public room, I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a	478.16701236366214
horse, his own having died yesterday from bleeding. I drew near, and	383.51700346604116
found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag.	475.0447662036365
‘_Pardieu_,’ said I, ‘my good gentleman, I have a horse to sell, too.’	486.10739291267873
‘Ay, and a very fine one! I saw him yesterday; your friend’s lackey was	350.7517123041099
leading him.’ ‘Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles?’ ‘Yes! Will	364.7377616873276
you sell him to me for that sum?’ ‘No; but I will play for him.’	382.40384537182035
‘What?’ ‘At dice.’ No sooner said than done, and I lost the horse. Ah,	368.43064231392987
ah! But please to observe I won back the equipage,” cried Athos.	485.6679574547908
D’Artagnan looked much disconcerted.	380.39908933924926
“This vexes you?” said Athos.	374.90408557726164
“Well, I must confess it does,” replied D’Artagnan. “That horse was to	463.03167590780265
have identified us in the day of battle. It was a pledge, a	305.4466385181325
remembrance. Athos, you have done wrong.”	397.28217100988525
“But, my dear friend, put yourself in my place,” replied the Musketeer.	329.74685021996294
“I was hipped to death; and still further, upon my honor, I don’t like	348.05982723425643
English horses. If it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will	327.00856791022045
suffice for that; it is quite remarkable enough. As to the horse, we	349.80626226411295
can easily find some excuse for its disappearance. Why the devil! A	455.5141496997787
horse is mortal; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy?”	342.03425579687723
D’Artagnan did not smile.	428.4960171403584
“It vexes me greatly,” continued Athos, “that you attach so much	435.27351073296745
importance to these animals, for I am not yet at the end of my story.”	411.07142170092044
“What else have you done.”	463.9119594447858
“After having lost my own horse, nine against ten—see how near—I formed	299.9938192833289
an idea of staking yours.”	414.7640869310051
“Yes; but you stopped at the idea, I hope?”	357.9247144690041
“No; for I put it in execution that very minute.”	416.39681348605006
“And the consequence?” said D’Artagnan, in great anxiety.	324.0600401530643
“I threw, and I lost.”	366.7743989133261
“What, my horse?”	322.2367606142503
“Your horse, seven against eight; a point short—you know the proverb.”	368.0032715395648
“Athos, you are not in your right senses, I swear.”	356.71764381969206
“My dear lad, that was yesterday, when I was telling you silly stories,	457.9091723940163
it was proper to tell me that, and not this morning. I lost him then,	386.17247727586096
with all his appointments and furniture.”	305.7213096997999
“Really, this is frightful.”	427.9690129403226
“Stop a minute; you don’t know all yet. I should make an excellent	371.8650612785741
gambler if I were not too hot-headed; but I was hot-headed, just as if	341.43234593591876
I had been drinking. Well, I was not hot-headed then—”	336.4715661364144
“Well, but what else could you play for? You had nothing left?”	433.64264594751364
“Oh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles	439.9967438507166
on your finger, and which I had observed yesterday.”	377.4300063455406
“This diamond!” said D’Artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.	385.2925244180463
“And as I am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own	442.58445035215794
once, I estimated it at a thousand pistoles.”	403.5571170673127
“I hope,” said D’Artagnan, half dead with fright, “you made no mention	366.85914061353327
of my diamond?”	409.271071248916
“On the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only	399.2382453207555
resource; with it I might regain our horses and their harnesses, and	411.21071899742043
even money to pay our expenses on the road.”	412.5022467888198
“Athos, you make me tremble!” cried D’Artagnan.	456.45593238127435
“I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary, who had likewise	471.49698734818656
remarked it. What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star	348.35362488163196
from heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it? Impossible!”	330.9149590670851
“Go on, go on, my dear fellow!” said D’Artagnan; “for upon my honor,	425.93425227462717
you will kill me with your indifference.”	363.73480385725065
“We divided, then, this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles	319.7843291431358
each.”	436.0967858024447
“You are laughing at me, and want to try me!” said D’Artagnan, whom	398.4729987952928
anger began to take by the hair, as Minerva takes Achilles, in the	340.4137118027245
_Iliad_.	433.3815352217477
“No, I do not jest, _mordieu!_ I should like to have seen you in my	461.38921723110917
place! I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face, and had	377.3794606785302
been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles.”	412.9547132678009
“That was no reason for staking my diamond!” replied D’Artagnan,	465.7283139819289
closing his hand with a nervous spasm.	421.21946699622595
“Hear the end. Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws,	303.31762094229543
without revenge; in thirteen throws I had lost all—in thirteen throws.	292.74059900243213
The number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of	354.81407376636247
July that—”	353.81872374478985
“_Ventrebleu!_” cried D’Artagnan, rising from the table, the story of	411.1332493903413
the present day making him forget that of the preceding one.	407.14870122549155
“Patience!” said Athos; “I had a plan. The Englishman was an original;	490.208242207584
I had seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud, and Grimaud had	351.08237640019206
told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service. I	450.5574958950853
staked Grimaud, the silent Grimaud, divided into ten portions.”	361.4862347016887
“Well, what next?” said D’Artagnan, laughing in spite of himself.	312.91477618335
“Grimaud himself, understand; and with the ten parts of Grimaud, which	472.958740526808
are not worth a ducatoon, I regained the diamond. Tell me, now, if	463.7879523185064
persistence is not a virtue?”	412.4213811471801
“My faith! But this is droll,” cried D’Artagnan, consoled, and holding	329.4858697458801
his sides with laughter.	339.58783088278193
“You may guess, finding the luck turned, that I again staked the	462.1592304360213
diamond.”	409.49867075908566
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, becoming angry again.	452.19586864056294
“I won back your harness, then your horse, then my harness, then my	360.32028538670727
horse, and then I lost again. In brief, I regained your harness and	292.25576922313934
then mine. That’s where we are. That was a superb throw, so I left off	432.0773446822797
there.”	483.5208666988109
D’Artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his	385.9710954516431
breast.	405.17907130826154
“Then the diamond is safe?” said he, timidly.	409.0560301252615
“Intact, my dear friend; besides the harness of your Bucephalus and	360.88454763124616
mine.”	424.76097184596
“But what is the use of harnesses without horses?”	474.43627256809776
“I have an idea about them.”	328.61608551893374
“Athos, you make me shudder.”	326.4892082029334
“Listen to me. You have not played for a long time, D’Artagnan.”	335.2606077923539
“And I have no inclination to play.”	471.5589745150411
“Swear to nothing. You have not played for a long time, I said; you	489.9489382706066
ought, then, to have a good hand.”	414.85527095566715
“Well, what then?”	360.43597752331254
“Well; the Englishman and his companion are still here. I remarked that	324.0389725932862
he regretted the horse furniture very much. You appear to think much of	336.5523064712312
your horse. In your place I would stake the furniture against the	461.0293925161933
horse.”	397.10230161833056
“But he will not wish for only one harness.”	398.8691007766654
“Stake both, _pardieu!_ I am not selfish, as you are.”	318.25888625875257
“You would do so?” said D’Artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the	345.18380033498204
confidence of Athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.	388.3579745222435
“On my honor, in one single throw.”	337.6252427097752
“But having lost the horses, I am particularly anxious to preserve the	318.0841285743658
harnesses.”	468.6771591028672
“Stake your diamond, then.”	439.59448055414185
“This? That’s another matter. Never, never!”	423.21655642775045
“The devil!” said Athos. “I would propose to you to stake Planchet, but	304.17520496536315
as that has already been done, the Englishman would not, perhaps, be	411.69705440788914
willing.”	451.2466577852842
“Decidedly, my dear Athos,” said D’Artagnan, “I should like better not	459.04065142599416
to risk anything.”	328.63538073751056
“That’s a pity,” said Athos, coolly. “The Englishman is overflowing	437.5152575546599
with pistoles. Good Lord, try one throw! One throw is soon made!”	378.9936086528002
“And if I lose?”	464.32687360795717
“You will win.”	390.9679675127273
“But if I lose?”	292.5174525106562
“Well, you will surrender the harnesses.”	374.9755913933798
“Have with you for one throw!” said D’Artagnan.	320.78991324751354
Athos went in quest of the Englishman, whom he found in the stable,	394.8019668292287
examining the harnesses with a greedy eye. The opportunity was good. He	486.957228405701
proposed the conditions—the two harnesses, either against one horse or	359.8660397758573
a hundred pistoles. The Englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses	334.09415953912645
were worth three hundred pistoles. He consented.	413.5252295344597
D’Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the	461.21502122331
number three; his paleness terrified Athos, who, however, consented	311.37615947184344
himself with saying, “That’s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the	350.6787958212808
horses fully equipped, monsieur.”	430.89803168351017
The Englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble	483.97141618867875
to shake the dice. He threw them on the table without looking at them,	407.20551599756413
so sure was he of victory; D’Artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill	433.3897607237632
humor.	412.2467747446847
“Hold, hold, hold!” said Athos, wit his quiet tone; “that throw of the	432.766224083902
dice is extraordinary. I have not seen such a one four times in my	293.41449120643415
life. Two aces!”	491.80936304609355
The Englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment. D’Artagnan	450.38531847151535
looked, and was seized with pleasure.	366.33887165359977
“Yes,” continued Athos, “four times only; once at the house of Monsieur	398.0887015936096
Créquy; another time at my own house in the country, in my château	414.512259415478
at—when I had a château; a third time at Monsieur de Tréville’s where	345.4766580140382
it surprised us all; and the fourth time at a cabaret, where it fell to	468.20791237458195
my lot, and where I lost a hundred louis and a supper on it.”	419.86595111808924
“Then Monsieur takes his horse back again,” said the Englishman.	484.33789767756724
“Certainly,” said D’Artagnan.	298.33809348842885
“Then there is no revenge?”	320.4108137964126
“Our conditions said, ‘No revenge,’ you will please to recollect.”	294.9908716394049
“That is true; the horse shall be restored to your lackey, monsieur.”	374.78453703585575
“A moment,” said Athos; “with your permission, monsieur, I wish to	320.6652022872759
speak a word with my friend.”	396.547129063503
“Say on.”	464.35487126122166
Athos drew D’Artagnan aside.	409.7019387882041
“Well, Tempter, what more do you want with me?” said D’Artagnan. “You	370.8399205569051
want me to throw again, do you not?”	487.05196265181405
“No, I would wish you to reflect.”	436.26546461408157
“On what?”	393.5956738944339
“You mean to take your horse?”	314.00197380261943
“Without doubt.”	316.83590562142734
“You are wrong, then. I would take the hundred pistoles. You know you	333.20628023636067
have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles, at	305.15619441699295
your choice.”	344.7328008112121
“Yes.”	365.5812581242211
“Well, then, I repeat, you are wrong. What is the use of one horse for	327.37261294330455
us two? I could not ride behind. We should look like the two sons of	418.0460020937227
Aymon, who had lost their brother. You cannot think of humiliating me	411.78606046089135
by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger. For my part,	296.73975987678295
I should not hesitate a moment; I should take the hundred pistoles. We	448.75101960006555
want money for our return to Paris.”	293.3360242671623
“I am much attached to that horse, Athos.”	349.86408298852973
“And there again you are wrong. A horse slips and injures a joint; a	436.29457546773244
horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a	406.3314186940822
manger in which a glandered horse has eaten. There is a horse, while on	491.5830813015581
the contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master.”	473.5278027681644
“But how shall we get back?”	401.6353884436567
“Upon our lackey’s horses, _pardieu_. Anybody may see by our bearing	314.09974647484773
that we are people of condition.”	304.0535982934014
“Pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while Aramis and Porthos	448.8592116015809
caracole on their steeds.”	394.8000340682855
“Aramis! Porthos!” cried Athos, and laughed aloud.	435.62623090372074
“What is it?” asked D’Artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the	315.674554804361
hilarity of his friend.	401.9066957541141
“Nothing, nothing! Go on!”	407.6723500641824
“Your advice, then?”	349.44271132732723
“To take the hundred pistoles, D’Artagnan. With the hundred pistoles we	348.75243222860934
can live well to the end of the month. We have undergone a great deal	372.9042858024954
of fatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm.”	484.8226166676735
“I rest? Oh, no, Athos. Once in Paris, I shall prosecute my search for	448.9596467578034
that unfortunate woman!”	393.53009911729487
“Well, you may be assured that your horse will not be half so	366.9774216407597
serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis. Take the	431.2374825485718
hundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!”	437.46388027275265
D’Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. This last reason	315.92444210851625
appeared convincing. Besides, he feared that by resisting longer he	305.3940780489579
should appear selfish in the eyes of Athos. He acquiesced, therefore,	378.03217519058336
and chose the hundred pistoles, which the Englishman paid down on the	391.5904804052264
spot.	375.6223861278064
They then determined to depart. Peace with the landlord, in addition to	330.9806129649426
Athos’s old horse, cost six pistoles. D’Artagnan and Athos took the	431.75859360808397
nags of Planchet and Grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot,	371.5150980014332
carrying the saddles on their heads.	309.40362209354544
However ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance	427.82572585014066
of their servants, and arrived at Crèvecœur. From a distance they	375.52160109775537
perceived Aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking	431.8744211838323
out, like Sister Anne, at the dust in the horizon.	376.60244293020446
“_Holà_, Aramis! What the devil are you doing there?” cried the two	338.178346089035
friends.	469.72545042745935
“Ah, is that you, D’Artagnan, and you, Athos?” said the young man. “I	360.82858242047183
was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world	403.264990619917
leave us. My English horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud of	293.6134383262638
dust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the	305.1081065827231
things of the earth. Life itself may be resolved into three words:	382.077894788143
_Erat, est, fuit_.”	479.92746907151445
“Which means—” said D’Artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.	309.4962629755617
“Which means that I have just been duped—sixty louis for a horse which	474.61444361177905
by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour.”	409.1089086163673
D’Artagnan and Athos laughed aloud.	471.2315361422329
“My dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, “don’t be too angry with me, I beg.	382.15403635584016
Necessity has no law; besides, I am the person punished, as that	363.28633558130616
rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. Ah, you	340.79363472049124
fellows are good managers! You ride on our lackey’s horses, and have	422.8693325937971
your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages.”	363.93577947773446
At the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had	434.8241029133573
appeared upon the Amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and Planchet and	488.2863338581427
Grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. The cart was	370.4984404220928
returning empty to Paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their	365.8532467443279
transport, to slake the wagoner’s thirst along the route.	387.22367289720074
“What is this?” said Aramis, on seeing them arrive. “Nothing but	440.0622591374156
saddles?”	445.239225681935
“Now do you understand?” said Athos.	323.17672716225604
“My friends, that’s exactly like me! I retained my harness by instinct.	441.49179120117975
_Holà_, Bazin! Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of	473.481481062132
these gentlemen.”	305.345008248065
“And what have you done with your ecclesiastics?” asked D’Artagnan.	412.9446136024542
“My dear fellow, I invited them to a dinner the next day,” replied	325.45054792349663
Aramis. “They have some capital wine here—please to observe that in	297.55693430975595
passing. I did my best to make them drunk. Then the curate forbade me	378.8548188514493
to quit my uniform, and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a	453.23676849680373
Musketeer.”	403.35711199737574
“Without a thesis?” cried D’Artagnan, “without a thesis? I demand the	325.1441556782203
suppression of the thesis.”	414.1092399852332
“Since then,” continued Aramis, “I have lived very agreeably. I have	348.3945099631255
begun a poem in verses of one syllable. That is rather difficult, but	455.0897009387452
the merit in all things consists in the difficulty. The matter is	393.3630987666926
gallant. I will read you the first canto. It has four hundred lines,	302.5130967030145
and lasts a minute.”	318.6451627247418
“My faith, my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, who detested verses almost	372.66734224854866
as much as he did Latin, “add to the merit of the difficulty that of	297.65185892394334
the brevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two	313.9821008825188
merits.”	383.2752453952461
“You will see,” continued Aramis, “that it breathes irreproachable	470.9610999802322
passion. And so, my friends, we return to Paris? Bravo! I am ready. We	476.5280584148847
are going to rejoin that good fellow, Porthos. So much the better. You	307.59988558599656
can’t think how I have missed him, the great simpleton. To see him so	469.57039154604706
self-satisfied reconciles me with myself. He would not sell his horse;	332.13970639595135
not for a kingdom! I think I can see him now, mounted upon his superb	334.28308353763305
animal and seated in his handsome saddle. I am sure he will look like	334.5901653082461
the Great Mogul!”	450.47299222377154
They made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses. Aramis discharged	343.12169310499195
his bill, placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set	307.35953045834276
forward to join Porthos.	383.39846291811136
They found him up, less pale than when D’Artagnan left him after his	296.9640742708269
first visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was	365.00313456889586
spread enough for four persons. This dinner consisted of meats nicely	332.3043780536324
dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.	464.0654638953399
“Ah, _pardieu!_” said he, rising, “you come in the nick of time,	369.12732574823076
gentlemen. I was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me.”	460.2907018048485
“Oh, oh!” said D’Artagnan, “Mousqueton has not caught these bottles	319.44213995523234
with his lasso. Besides, here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of	429.0339480341946
beef.”	400.384970900679
“I am recruiting myself,” said Porthos, “I am recruiting myself.	378.790202143112
Nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains. Did you ever	312.1193989798997
suffer from a strain, Athos?”	479.97586749654477
“Never! Though I remember, in our affair of the Rue Férou, I received a	332.2013593512838
sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the	393.47050128417743
same effect.”	332.2580571820187
“But this dinner was not intended for you alone, Porthos?” said Aramis.	368.2109547398352
“No,” said Porthos, “I expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who	377.15163134467707
have just sent me word they could not come. You will take their places	312.549721509041
and I shall not lose by the exchange. _Holà_, Mousqueton, seats, and	346.06082612944533
order double the bottles!”	419.7380329704278
“Do you know what we are eating here?” said Athos, at the end of ten	368.2822499725219
minutes.	306.9894648284004
“_Pardieu!_” replied D’Artagnan, “for my part, I am eating veal	366.33437639426086
garnished with shrimps and vegetables.”	404.95399810157636
“And I some lamb chops,” said Porthos.	327.1209789945917
“And I a plain chicken,” said Aramis.	458.4952601145285
“You are all mistaken, gentlemen,” answered Athos, gravely; “you are	361.33719640557064
eating horse.”	447.21672714114766
“Eating what?” said D’Artagnan.	433.78288323247125
“Horse!” said Aramis, with a grimace of disgust.	313.3723911037819
Porthos alone made no reply.	491.75012698607816
“Yes, horse. Are we not eating a horse, Porthos? And perhaps his	317.4530546074938
saddle, therewith.”	364.14015901536186
“No, gentlemen, I have kept the harness,” said Porthos.	324.59252639610173
“My faith,” said Aramis, “we are all alike. One would think we had	360.6794506622551
tipped the wink.”	346.20220899611036
“What could I do?” said Porthos. “This horse made my visitors ashamed	361.68613266273803
of theirs, and I don’t like to humiliate people.”	304.9319822692888
“Then your duchess is still at the waters?” asked D’Artagnan.	387.31462998963167
“Still,” replied Porthos. “And, my faith, the governor of the	373.5791165484004
province—one of the gentlemen I expected today—seemed to have such a	348.16824428552115
wish for him, that I gave him to him.”	491.02510596866114
“Gave him?” cried D’Artagnan.	300.55337704058127
“My God, yes, _gave_, that is the word,” said Porthos; “for the animal	383.7938794173838
was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow	437.6478054926072
would only give me eighty.”	359.234299087966
“Without the saddle?” said Aramis.	320.4506865034159
“Yes, without the saddle.”	309.3551987264521
“You will observe, gentlemen,” said Athos, “that Porthos has made the	361.16659427686074
best bargain of any of us.”	424.87373844198265
And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the	478.2846417921154
astonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of	393.1339429761132
their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.	303.70628702371334
“There is one comfort, we are all in cash,” said D’Artagnan.	315.9672926444307
“Well, for my part,” said Athos, “I found Aramis’s Spanish wine so good	386.3325915984065
that I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the	326.5495733996932
lackeys. That has weakened my purse.”	391.5359100670057
“And I,” said Aramis, “imagined that I had given almost my last sou to	305.66590220585056
the church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens, with whom I had	296.09734101610627
made engagements which I ought to have kept. I have ordered Masses for	377.6532651182008
myself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for	332.14671142714553
which I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited.”	327.269900360279
“And I,” said Porthos, “do you think my strain cost me nothing?—without	481.78848412485684
reckoning Mousqueton’s wound, for which I had to have the surgeon twice	373.6272670492286
a day, and who charged me double on account of that foolish Mousqueton	452.82940026364986
having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only	414.2120032382151
show to an apothecary; so I advised him to try never to get wounded	334.94565487290856
there any more.”	347.7862652295101
“Ay, ay!” said Athos, exchanging a smile with D’Artagnan and Aramis,	301.6562506900624
“it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is	428.5562377316713
like a good master.”	309.5137293832498
“In short,” said Porthos, “when all my expenses are paid, I shall have,	298.9803869549946
at most, thirty crowns left.”	444.06059417661004
“And I about ten pistoles,” said Aramis.	364.2154997977497
“Well, then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the society. How	460.4472931441402
much have you left of your hundred pistoles, D’Artagnan?”	314.22373963211675
“Of my hundred pistoles? Why, in the first place I gave you fifty.”	334.13061288682513
“You think so?”	374.4372727176235
“_Pardieu!_”	336.87295285959755
“Ah, that is true. I recollect.”	417.08000496553063
“Then I paid the host six.”	462.6407977922894
“What a brute of a host! Why did you give him six pistoles?”	395.8094953161534
“You told me to give them to him.”	396.7677740584096
“It is true; I am too good-natured. In brief, how much remains?”	347.08404905402074
“Twenty-five pistoles,” said D’Artagnan.	346.18338378611935
“And I,” said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, “I—”	490.42939066316734
“You? Nothing!”	305.0485970605039
“My faith! So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general	406.97150441662956
stock.”	437.7619512726115
“Now, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all.”	292.9570213380107
“Porthos?”	314.40270797618456
“Thirty crowns.”	455.6106166006673
“Aramis?”	426.18877385336003
“Ten pistoles.”	437.08082613494463
“And you, D’Artagnan?”	485.1191473392972
“Twenty-five.”	450.9732634693961
“That makes in all?” said Athos.	452.0694256163729
“Four hundred and seventy-five livres,” said D’Artagnan, who reckoned	491.94320200272887
like Archimedes.	349.1824377676982
“On our arrival in Paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the	321.12373809064076
harnesses,” said Porthos.	441.69206721639296
“But our troop horses?” said Aramis.	333.32478694883093
“Well, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the	401.94424303452683
masters, for which we will draw lots. With the four hundred livres we	432.26499737322604
will make the half of one for one of the unmounted, and then we will	387.2926055170234
give the turnings out of our pockets to D’Artagnan, who has a steady	480.62845096842887
hand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to.	489.2031444660812
There!”	329.9483348908097
“Let us dine, then,” said Porthos; “it is getting cold.”	297.2861303111808
The friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the	362.10640359603144
repast, the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton, Bazin,	365.72511106051127
Planchet, and Grimaud.	408.6575908025884
On arriving in Paris, D’Artagnan found a letter from M. de Tréville,	449.63245426606096
which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he	415.31829890220934
should enter the company of the Musketeers.	296.8973155846589
As this was the height of D’Artagnan’s worldly ambition—apart, be it	350.96691084338386
well understood, from his desire of finding Mme. Bonacieux—he ran, full	338.48587133280364
of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour	341.9479953519596
before, but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. They were	426.51761507091425
assembled in council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated	337.3434492432243
an event of some gravity. M. de Tréville had intimated to them his	372.9063063868098
Majesty’s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May, and	328.0154873018235
they must immediately prepare their outfits.	490.50457477712973
The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.	326.03266861364466
M. de Tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline.	293.9471608837917
“And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?” said D’Artagnan.	314.3841290252607
“Oh, we can scarcely say. We have made our calculations with Spartan	414.56633557440676
economy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres.”	367.7735266139111
“Four times fifteen makes sixty—six thousand livres,” said Athos.	437.4976136776907
“It seems to me,” said D’Artagnan, “with a thousand livres each—I do	415.16164818829867
not speak as a Spartan, but as a procurator—”	415.6927400494817
This word _procurator_ roused Porthos. “Stop,” said he, “I have an	340.33298765901725
idea.”	301.0811574238911
“Well, that’s something, for I have not the shadow of one,” said Athos	344.4024028953824
coolly; “but as to D’Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to	477.3929725873281
_ours_ has driven him out of his senses. A thousand livres! For my	398.8722475952335
part, I declare I want two thousand.”	388.88150596005244
“Four times two makes eight,” then said Aramis; “it is eight thousand	320.4616345115575
that we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have	358.23742403899087
already the saddles.”	332.3568223376029
“Besides,” said Athos, waiting till D’Artagnan, who went to thank	396.890812720361
Monsieur de Tréville, had shut the door, “besides, there is that	490.04161389035403
beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend. What the	424.7875281343071
devil! D’Artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in	487.8837652806675
embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger.”	331.1631864764141
Chapter XXIX.	473.28536077448086
HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS	294.715343329345
The most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly D’Artagnan,	472.4247912981183
although he, in his quality of Guardsman, would be much more easily	369.5735730954157
equipped than Messieurs the Musketeers, who were all of high rank; but	415.7311773306268
our Gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and	392.0990697746929
almost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction)	373.21296089663014
so vain as almost to rival Porthos. To this preoccupation of his	356.8971063497335
vanity, D’Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less	310.13208473864916
selfish. Notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting Mme. Bonacieux,	481.5848291140214
he could obtain no intelligence of her. M. de Tréville had spoken of	460.43176131874475
her to the queen. The queen was ignorant where the mercer’s young wife	455.4908334771123
was, but had promised to have her sought for; but this promise was very	330.8401422600887
vague and did not at all reassure D’Artagnan.	345.4608542389282
Athos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a	341.2405040430384
single step to equip himself.	296.6150761124905
“We have still fifteen days before us,” said he to his friends, “well,	352.389701846289
if at the end of a fortnight I have found nothing, or rather if nothing	480.5454941911779
has come to find me, as I, too good a Catholic to kill myself with a	413.40906176555586
pistol bullet, I will seek a good quarrel with four of his Eminence’s	395.0469128833313
Guards or with eight Englishmen, and I will fight until one of them has	484.67726829483297
killed me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. It	485.76034047778666
will then be said of me that I died for the king; so that I shall have	359.9929059000104
performed my duty without the expense of an outfit.”	397.2863641968853
Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his	438.91591992221004
head and repeating, “I shall follow up on my idea.”	376.57694976260996
Aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.	327.5253340711551
It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in	385.73513293088234
the community.	378.48891737671204
The lackeys on their part, like the coursers of Hippolytus, shared the	467.96814506737303
sadness of their masters. Mousqueton collected a store of crusts;	470.1431494781351
Bazin, who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the	469.33441735339244
churches; Planchet watched the flight of flies; and Grimaud, whom the	411.30788886645485
general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his	415.84049562320666
master, heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.	437.30124390302944
The three friends—for, as we have said, Athos had sworn not to stir a	456.9717433481467
foot to equip himself—went out early in the morning, and returned late	362.56931349170475
at night. They wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as	304.6022203513796
if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. They	334.9125554856023
might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they	437.32800983931986
wherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one	476.2487496889998
another, as much as to say, “Have you found anything?”	351.45448916098127
However, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it	426.0058230696128
earnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of	428.6694317150994
execution, this worthy Porthos. D’Artagnan perceived him one day	340.17608786522914
walking toward the church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively.	402.77800629026626
He entered, after having twisted his mustache and elongated his	458.0612978425048
imperial, which always announced on his part the most triumphant	292.48996305785226
resolutions. As D’Artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself,	302.69384805940126
Porthos believed he had not been seen. D’Artagnan entered behind him.	331.28763218023875
Porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar. D’Artagnan, still	295.9345646747134
unperceived, supported himself against the other side.	324.710051646703
There happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of	373.38430868181933
people. Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.	317.8285601331655
Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing	463.03207290173384
the distress of the interior. His hat was a little napless, his feather	401.542081501982
was a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces	330.3022347924375
were a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things	323.5681778239717
were not seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos.	308.13664487158843
D’Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which	483.76666259832956
Porthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry,	379.82797688712617
but erect and haughty under her black hood. The eyes of Porthos were	382.0643709062815
furtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the	382.33596023988673
nave.	326.65358506413975
On her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the	308.48005281266245
rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then	333.50975021310626
immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously. It was plain that	414.7699760046249
this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit	417.5592218216649
her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not	481.85669472689807
sit still in her seat.	439.3278522838292
Porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a	321.0108611240552
second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near	350.37939340764797
the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no	465.9810514560928
doubt, a great lady—for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought	387.0748396158194
the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the	392.22879732251556
emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the	336.46352562537885
Mass.	345.5361080207845
The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the	468.7733713128251
looks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the	457.03771053026526
velvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant.	406.47925807802744
During this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible	292.21121673103715
motions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating	466.42380211948387
smiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.	490.99946939614927
Then she cried, “Ahem!” under cover of the _mea culpa_, striking her	300.94313845260683
breast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red	337.733513731626
cushion, turned round toward her. Porthos paid no attention.	347.4613227892791
Nevertheless, he understood it all, but was deaf.	296.88138129750183
The lady with the red cushion produced a great effect—for she was very	409.3206267874219
handsome—upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival	482.19053929568474
really to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her much	295.3905373646437
prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon	479.2323161835618
D’Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of	305.0843193306415
Dover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the	326.61673098435773
name of Milady.	446.7746657019961
D’Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion,	378.98033675002114
continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him	406.36356173453635
greatly. He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the	326.5535395131849
procurator’s wife of the Rue aux Ours, which was the more probable from	335.24011047052807
the church of St. Leu being not far from that locality.	367.1317975389372
He guessed, likewise, by induction, that Porthos was taking his revenge	457.1264444127603
for the defeat of Chantilly, when the procurator’s wife had proved so	311.2567626607174
refractory with respect to her purse.	438.8275993593485
Amid all this, D’Artagnan remarked also that not one countenance	384.194695757875
responded to the gallantries of Porthos. There were only chimeras and	341.52797450025554
illusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality	438.01556277875886
except illusions and chimeras?	464.72076262100154
The sermon over, the procurator’s wife advanced toward the holy font.	480.3869727579885
Porthos went before her, and instead of a finger, dipped his whole hand	464.4897851882745
in. The procurator’s wife smiled, thinking that it was for her Porthos	342.1703250137407
had put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly	396.0447703416882
undeceived. When she was only about three steps from him, he turned his	298.7531490026788
head round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red	370.74705659153676
cushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy	335.2227973985557
and her woman.	398.92168673938124
When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew	329.1169723132145
his dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great	352.1435919946075
hand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the	473.9443288649695
cross, and left the church.	490.85741990474787
This was too much for the procurator’s wife; she doubted not there was	347.33895719461935
an intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady	420.19469782291503
she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator’s wife, she	418.0030408006395
contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, “Eh,	358.85621297252965
Monsieur Porthos, you don’t offer me any holy water?”	440.59575235409204
Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a	326.4529561319314
sleep of a hundred years.	295.0526754304965
“Ma-madame!” cried he; “is that you? How is your husband, our dear	363.959107125129
Monsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes	383.0710894015358
have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?”	414.62518025659017
“I was within two paces of you, monsieur,” replied the procurator’s	462.6281426791175
wife; “but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the	480.8387613985308
pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.”	425.45808839752704
Porthos pretended to be confused. “Ah,” said he, “you have remarked—”	352.0687357786244
“I must have been blind not to have seen.”	378.755814144417
“Yes,” said Porthos, “that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom I have	310.23077632768957
great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and	414.28602351652984
who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried	480.5873765120267
in this vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me.”	422.644792651805
“Monsieur Porthos,” said the procurator’s wife, “will you have the	342.4600427096681
kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes? I have something to say	386.2597449930159
to you.”	485.2482986592935
“Certainly, madame,” said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler	433.72110595772335
does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.	333.5553080511138
At that moment D’Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a	380.6952811704471
passing glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.	352.54583148814777
“Eh, eh!” said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy	321.6732316262976
morality of that gallant period, “there is one who will be equipped in	425.29409483543697
good time!”	343.99690775405764
Porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator’s wife,	465.4695550940473
as a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire—a	479.0998765941713
little-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. In	294.47599450728524
the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their	412.00727634192486
crusts, and children at play.	435.36383202112336
“Ah, Monsieur Porthos,” cried the procurator’s wife, when she was	292.62739282988167
assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the	379.86765379100984
locality could either see or hear her, “ah, Monsieur Porthos, you are a	349.5485435728952
great conqueror, as it appears!”	407.2093548207673
“I, madame?” said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; “how so?”	366.988300827249
“The signs just now, and the holy water! But that must be a princess,	430.02458680773236
at least—that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!”	358.56227920076765
“My God! Madame, you are deceived,” said Porthos; “she is simply a	447.14776230162954
duchess.”	311.5291165483169
“And that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage	392.20544608108656
with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?”	452.83805074786585
Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye	437.7149208281055
of a jealous woman, Mme. Coquenard had seen everything.	432.6643474548167
Porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red	463.7033593107956
cushion a princess.	398.53283462494784
“Ah, you are quite the pet of the ladies, Monsieur Porthos!” resumed	418.6426866427864
the procurator’s wife, with a sigh.	354.84330807941876
“Well,” responded Porthos, “you may imagine, with the physique with	298.3682895188043
which nature has endowed me, I am not in want of good luck.”	452.4280353626637
“Good Lord, how quickly men forget!” cried the procurator’s wife,	363.63583722967405
raising her eyes toward heaven.	491.10599999498925
“Less quickly than the women, it seems to me,” replied Porthos; “for I,	449.21299943905706
madame, I may say I was your victim, when wounded, dying, I was	375.97866285280855
abandoned by the surgeons. I, the offspring of a noble family, who	299.5277113923177
placed reliance upon your friendship—I was near dying of my wounds at	485.9776565557537
first, and of hunger afterward, in a beggarly inn at Chantilly, without	382.7540914662384
you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters I addressed to	453.6071870340587
you.”	369.6769767690295
“But, Monsieur Porthos,” murmured the procurator’s wife, who began to	304.8150264243205
feel that, to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time, she	302.8709531092361
was wrong.	394.5645858856941
“I, who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de—”	443.5026970688522
“I know it well.”	417.7004505671405
“The Comtesse de—”	450.0204516118842
“Monsieur Porthos, be generous!”	344.7389501282421
“You are right, madame, and I will not finish.”	369.53110820938934
“But it was my husband who would not hear of lending.”	414.4965138253997
“Madame Coquenard,” said Porthos, “remember the first letter you wrote	477.88890978996915
me, and which I preserve engraved in my memory.”	309.5339943810308
The procurator’s wife uttered a groan.	292.85502489259017
“Besides,” said she, “the sum you required me to borrow was rather	415.7778079149382
large.”	334.12701713893796
“Madame Coquenard, I gave you the preference. I had but to write to the	491.51443694589676
Duchesse—but I won’t repeat her name, for I am incapable of	324.47891043514346
compromising a woman; but this I know, that I had but to write to her	327.41358541567024
and she would have sent me fifteen hundred.”	484.56117740683
The procurator’s wife shed a tear.	416.0486225140283
“Monsieur Porthos,” said she, “I can assure you that you have severely	470.3186393459162
punished me; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a	316.3171998269012
similar situation, you have but to apply to me.”	362.3087887527247
“Fie, madame, fie!” said Porthos, as if disgusted. “Let us not talk	448.4553413698495
about money, if you please; it is humiliating.”	489.78649477286694
“Then you no longer love me!” said the procurator’s wife, slowly and	464.1430858993041
sadly.	422.4464624530723
Porthos maintained a majestic silence.	472.02226429636767
“And that is the only reply you make? Alas, I understand.”	381.59489613657826
“Think of the offense you have committed toward me, madame! It remains	342.5292571023235
_here!_” said Porthos, placing his hand on his heart, and pressing it	445.18236536209804
strongly.	393.7217984753542
“I will repair it, indeed I will, my dear Porthos.”	293.87804041746983
“Besides, what did I ask of you?” resumed Porthos, with a movement of	461.6456162896668
the shoulders full of good fellowship. “A loan, nothing more! After	399.556599306093
all, I am not an unreasonable man. I know you are not rich, Madame	400.84393880735826
Coquenard, and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients	483.5632570001005
to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them. Oh! If you were a duchess, a	342.14364014932846
marchioness, or a countess, it would be quite a different thing; it	359.1935823987129
would be unpardonable.”	385.9054752967083
The procurator’s wife was piqued.	411.6330331873032
“Please to know, Monsieur Porthos,” said she, “that my strongbox, the	456.919618783179
strongbox of a procurator’s wife though it may be, is better filled	423.63333877279973
than those of your affected minxes.”	297.08574157355525
“That doubles the offense,” said Porthos, disengaging his arm from that	293.2993435868805
of the procurator’s wife; “for if you are rich, Madame Coquenard, then	329.88759740733985
there is no excuse for your refusal.”	351.1490254772215
“When I said rich,” replied the procurator’s wife, who saw that she had	393.6585529656936
gone too far, “you must not take the word literally. I am not precisely	361.1688866686265
rich, though I am pretty well off.”	450.5371291452612
“Hold, madame,” said Porthos, “let us say no more upon the subject, I	378.3591411961539
beg of you. You have misunderstood me, all sympathy is extinct between	391.43314580868787
us.”	469.34710076225736
“Ingrate that you are!”	414.15033647908785
“Ah! I advise you to complain!” said Porthos.	442.17746882273383
“Begone, then, to your beautiful duchess; I will detain you no longer.”	341.9411917320143
“And she is not to be despised, in my opinion.”	370.20774108571106
“Now, Monsieur Porthos, once more, and this is the last! Do you love me	472.79419715439514
still?”	340.4813443273083
“Ah, madame,” said Porthos, in the most melancholy tone he could	303.2437307143543
assume, “when we are about to enter upon a campaign—a campaign, in	419.8177441059107
which my presentiments tell me I shall be killed—”	314.9666107156477
“Oh, don’t talk of such things!” cried the procurator’s wife, bursting	457.47599919178754
into tears.	297.8049480904902
“Something whispers me so,” continued Porthos, becoming more and more	314.27006758318157
melancholy.	362.2924317342511
“Rather say that you have a new love.”	312.34275318070235
“Not so; I speak frankly to you. No object affects me; and I even feel	440.76685849809945
here, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks for you. But in	386.26584500057294
fifteen days, as you know, or as you do not know, this fatal campaign	404.92126686101693
is to open. I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit. Then I	429.94726611379633
must make a journey to see my family, in the lower part of Brittany, to	376.3804296115672
obtain the sum necessary for my departure.”	324.18134667789144
Porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice.	473.1719106326342
“And as,” continued he, “the duchess whom you saw at the church has	412.83148979358646
estates near to those of my family, we mean to make the journey	304.56588555665394
together. Journeys, you know, appear much shorter when we travel two in	414.45108055384827
company.”	372.81888007761546
“Have you no friends in Paris, then, Monsieur Porthos?” said the	415.617267342211
procurator’s wife.	461.7303930468608
“I thought I had,” said Porthos, resuming his melancholy air; “but I	362.46621642441255
have been taught my mistake.”	370.02022398053236
“You have some!” cried the procurator’s wife, in a transport that	421.90017366731985
surprised even herself. “Come to our house tomorrow. You are the son of	316.3604996216597
my aunt, consequently my cousin; you come from Noyon, in Picardy; you	475.7711878679703
have several lawsuits and no attorney. Can you recollect all that?”	315.834264211687
“Perfectly, madame.”	296.949879276675
“Come at dinnertime.”	454.7612664465096
“Very well.”	319.7307827160629
“And be upon your guard before my husband, who is rather shrewd,	479.3231110100851
notwithstanding his seventy-six years.”	487.3150023469835
“Seventy-six years! _Peste!_ That’s a fine age!” replied Porthos.	364.2464063297788
“A great age, you mean, Monsieur Porthos. Yes, the poor man may be	465.2073117509934
expected to leave me a widow, any hour,” continued she, throwing a	304.86783419294534
significant glance at Porthos. “Fortunately, by our marriage contract,	459.3473701318585
the survivor takes everything.”	385.8370532539727
“All?”	444.36456447219643
“Yes, all.”	340.6801077897616
“You are a woman of precaution, I see, my dear Madame Coquenard,” said	399.7083183092608
Porthos, squeezing the hand of the procurator’s wife tenderly.	342.6097000039849
“We are then reconciled, dear Monsieur Porthos?” said she, simpering.	446.2933043527985
“For life,” replied Porthos, in the same manner.	341.30469621516045
“Till we meet again, then, dear traitor!”	377.55455883117867
“Till we meet again, my forgetful charmer!”	401.53460428555553
“Tomorrow, my angel!”	443.9474857854327
“Tomorrow, flame of my life!”	330.76287002076964
Chapter XXX.	344.6549175331681
D’ARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN	387.3411850900376
D’Artagnan followed Milady without being perceived by her. He saw her	433.03187465074
get into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to St.	444.7154162182296
Germain.	432.5751086757123
It was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two	308.91411098628936
powerful horses. D’Artagnan therefore returned to the Rue Férou.	355.62047690705765
In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet, who had stopped before the house	308.78022740359927
of a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most	354.230844297222
appetizing appearance.	310.4132964158474
He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in M. de Tréville’s	329.9933352309156
stables—one for himself, D’Artagnan, and one for Planchet—and bring	298.7362685649107
them to Athos’s place. Once for all, Tréville had placed his stable at	454.6033738843264
D’Artagnan’s service.	389.6888672109423
Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier, and D’Artagnan toward	358.6522831508744
the Rue Férou. Athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous	395.08220397468386
Spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into	315.21969252321026
Picardy. He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for D’Artagnan,	391.4458869174656
and Grimaud obeyed as usual.	393.47639479476004
D’Artagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between	377.673382616043
Porthos and the procurator’s wife, and how their comrade was probably	453.11370186111003
by that time in a fair way to be equipped.	314.5858789141448
“As for me,” replied Athos to this recital, “I am quite at my ease; it	366.754724364524
will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit.”	314.51484565260705
“Handsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear Athos, neither	303.05157232940604
princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations.”	366.1359388221291
“How young this D’Artagnan is!” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders;	326.0148073736889
and he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another bottle.	367.1734790024539
At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,	393.18721099144796
and told his master that the horses were ready.	385.12681382911245
“What horses?” asked Athos.	405.7499827126377
“Two horses that Monsieur de Tréville lends me at my pleasure, and with	347.5494051805334
which I am now going to take a ride to St. Germain.”	444.7952230698362
“Well, and what are you going to do at St. Germain?” then demanded	378.2010698153971
Athos.	297.06422236834766
Then D’Artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church, and	389.45729282364846
how he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak	434.2601145981612
and with the scar near his temple, filled his mind constantly.	344.51118293745037
“That is to say, you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame	435.6114668218082
Bonacieux,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, as if	340.722455656881
he pitied human weakness.	389.90026037352214
“I? not at all!” said D’Artagnan. “I am only curious to unravel the	474.8447452817337
mystery to which she is attached. I do not know why, but I imagine that	458.282559412793
this woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her	459.3249239900042
as I am, has an influence over my life.”	428.60997758401214
“Well, perhaps you are right,” said Athos. “I do not know a woman that	467.0300146488492
is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. Madame	339.23309324875646
Bonacieux is lost; so much the worse for her if she is found.”	336.7670304777273
“No, Athos, no, you are mistaken,” said D’Artagnan; “I love my poor	364.54037012092795
Constance more than ever, and if I knew the place in which she is, were	351.82792453409616
it at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of	374.9236399410171
her enemies; but I am ignorant. All my researches have been useless.	417.15396280067404
What is to be said? I must divert my attention!”	456.8882219463009
“Amuse yourself with Milady, my dear D’Artagnan; I wish you may with	338.16270484116325
all my heart, if that will amuse you.”	457.9383676238921
“Hear me, Athos,” said D’Artagnan. “Instead of shutting yourself up	337.7752941129838
here as if you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a	457.63442650824186
ride with me to St. Germain.”	339.06452837212913
“My dear fellow,” said Athos, “I ride horses when I have any; when I	345.86242610980645
have none, I go afoot.”	470.29758057384475
“Well,” said D’Artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of Athos, which	453.34397758172213
from any other person would have offended him, “I ride what I can get;	338.65434654804835
I am not so proud as you. So _au revoir_, dear Athos.”	360.7714111086292
“_Au revoir_,” said the Musketeer, making a sign to Grimaud to uncork	348.27768697117034
the bottle he had just brought.	491.43823344281486
D’Artagnan and Planchet mounted, and took the road to St. Germain.	293.4109933310132
All along the road, what Athos had said respecting Mme. Bonacieux	398.48080906979203
recurred to the mind of the young man. Although D’Artagnan was not of a	301.2756031142058
very sentimental character, the mercer’s pretty wife had made a real	366.56068548853267
impression upon his heart. As he said, he was ready to go to the end of	330.29680215739154
the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so	487.2269077720348
that he did not know which way to turn. Meantime, he was going to try	463.7137615482844
to find out Milady. Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak;	412.2010045601622
therefore she knew him. Now, in the opinion of D’Artagnan, it was	384.6478013011547
certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off Mme. Bonacieux	446.7994688590892
the second time, as he had carried her off the first. D’Artagnan then	385.46248078424327
only half-lied, which is lying but little, when he said that by going	462.46728254717107
in search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Constance.	335.8073215728632
Thinking of all this, and from time to time giving a touch of the spur	422.2995830290048
to his horse, D’Artagnan completed his short journey, and arrived at	335.7305798514723
St. Germain. He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years	334.8214586327902
later Louis XIV. was born. He rode up a very quiet street, looking to	331.36810832897993
the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his	327.12677374806026
beautiful Englishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house,	306.9178778823887
which, according to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the	406.76653777744195
street, he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted.	345.86929865903767
This person walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with	427.1077246979431
flowers. Planchet recognized him first.	366.4409261139283
“Eh, monsieur!” said he, addressing D’Artagnan, “don’t you remember	449.69752169043466
that face which is blinking yonder?”	452.0833944737156
“No,” said D’Artagnan, “and yet I am certain it is not the first time I	416.8657210337028
have seen that visage.”	464.7856188859163
“_Parbleu_, I believe it is not,” said Planchet. “Why, it is poor	396.4133281454599
Lubin, the lackey of the Comte de Wardes—he whom you took such good	439.4326041099474
care of a month ago at Calais, on the road to the governor’s country	368.37942330093097
house!”	304.526953546067
“So it is!” said D’Artagnan; “I know him now. Do you think he would	459.01365385306354
recollect you?”	325.8147724602955
“My faith, monsieur, he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have	347.29477854181823
retained a very clear recollection of me.”	415.8226099304986
“Well, go and talk with the boy,” said D’Artagnan, “and make out if you	400.4179666579028
can from his conversation whether his master is dead.”	391.4456456450631
Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin, who did not at all	342.67763543746827
remember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best	430.9972621957844
understanding possible; while D’Artagnan turned the two horses into a	468.2282227189315
lane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from	402.7370437811518
behind a hedge of filberts.	465.61199690621197
At the end of an instant’s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle,	471.39297316150504
and saw Milady’s carriage stop opposite to him. He could not be	487.7848085205302
mistaken; Milady was in it. D’Artagnan leaned upon the neck of his	464.37059267589416
horse, in order that he might see without being seen.	489.41192649799075
Milady put her charming blond head out at the window, and gave her	423.69158041822595
orders to her maid.	331.75556381423957
The latter—a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty-two years, active	395.637042058907
and lively, the true _soubrette_ of a great lady—jumped from the step	363.5356453224666
upon which, according to the custom of the time, she was seated, and	462.1704835421556
took her way toward the terrace upon which D’Artagnan had perceived	460.1936032479315
Lubin.	294.0745729501396
D’Artagnan followed the _soubrette_ with his eyes, and saw her go	307.36383481243035
toward the terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called	417.611442626344
Lubin, so that Planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for	380.6225341562621
the road where D’Artagnan had disappeared.	437.40831800210765
The maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out	295.687813923566
a little billet to him said, “For your master.”	333.71766348170064
“For my master?” replied Planchet, astonished.	319.0715537692107
“Yes, and important. Take it quickly.”	364.6401942932758
Thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward	389.1006933602544
the way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.	489.0261906824153
Planchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive	378.65769051389873
obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at	292.14156743482147
the end of twenty paces met D’Artagnan, who, having seen all, was	406.56818233886656
coming to him.	378.76027961081564
“For you, monsieur,” said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young	450.6945708224624
man.	364.3568904809571
“For me?” said D’Artagnan; “are you sure of that?”	299.5170198963572
“_Pardieu_, monsieur, I can’t be more sure. The _soubrette_ said, ‘For	422.9198183475055
your master.’ I have no other master but you; so—a pretty little lass,	364.91241128508796
my faith, is that _soubrette!_”	446.93289888587594
D’Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:	373.02440127980685
“A person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess	383.2741194312376
wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest?	308.4852213277118
Tomorrow, at the Hôtel Field of the Cloth of Gold, a lackey in black	378.540952690222
and red will wait for your reply.”	466.2588453548967
“Oh!” said D’Artagnan, “this is rather warm; it appears that Milady and	463.0970539720302
I are anxious about the health of the same person. Well, Planchet, how	402.5318265081551
is the good Monsieur de Wardes? He is not dead, then?”	395.38556132680844
“No, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in	301.49292671601654
his body; for you, without question, inflicted four upon the dear	345.9775048717324
gentleman, and he is still very weak, having lost almost all his blood.	365.67694089609404
As I said, monsieur, Lubin did not know me, and told me our adventure	448.48768311071143
from one end to the other.”	449.12842346886043
“Well done, Planchet! you are the king of lackeys. Now jump onto your	390.4962877942158
horse, and let us overtake the carriage.”	406.4835435215748
This did not take long. At the end of five minutes they perceived the	417.725244628488
carriage drawn up by the roadside; a cavalier, richly dressed, was	397.51253657472137
close to the door.	377.834669613896
The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that	424.7480447390898
D’Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but	440.64399811364126
the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence.	445.95537543076716
The conversation took place in English—a language which D’Artagnan	483.67106636752794
could not understand; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that	393.51066362125516
the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great rage. She terminated it by an	383.92083090198696
action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation; this	400.95849961900075
was a blow with her fan, applied with such force that the little	478.3600296615574
feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces.	478.03031068373934
The cavalier laughed aloud, which appeared to exasperate Milady still	428.01890509860505
more.	411.1260172517029
D’Artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere. He approached the	325.0638770752964
other door, and taking off his hat respectfully, said, “Madame, will	301.3618019350524
you permit me to offer you my services? It appears to me that this	316.4255312332731
cavalier has made you very angry. Speak one word, madame, and I take	439.16867042056066
upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy.”	362.3971933147421
At the first word Milady turned, looking at the young man with	340.4656987898095
astonishment; and when he had finished, she said in very good French,	482.83735044514
“Monsieur, I should with great confidence place myself under your	310.40313984036584
protection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my brother.”	326.66999609318304
“Ah, excuse me, then,” said D’Artagnan. “You must be aware that I was	352.2632967508112
ignorant of that, madame.”	370.0291621225781
“What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?” cried the	295.3891139331497
cavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother, stooping down to	316.44717154866885
the height of the coach window. “Why does not he go about his	364.17112880762573
business?”	414.8465912795956
“Stupid fellow yourself!” said D’Artagnan, stooping in his turn on the	299.39603500841514
neck of his horse, and answering on his side through the carriage	378.36022210403723
window. “I do not go on because it pleases me to stop here.”	408.7378232334125
The cavalier addressed some words in English to his sister.	420.557641998512
“I speak to you in French,” said D’Artagnan; “be kind enough, then, to	473.3636692283774
reply to me in the same language. You are Madame’s brother, I learn—be	456.5966005440682
it so; but fortunately you are not mine.”	383.9095516960034
It might be thought that Milady, timid as women are in general, would	311.4690704259074
have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to	385.8043478810007
prevent the quarrel from going too far; but on the contrary, she threw	412.3508379491546
herself back in her carriage, and called out coolly to the coachman,	360.09638128250924
“Go on—home!”	472.27864169720806
The pretty _soubrette_ cast an anxious glance at D’Artagnan, whose good	385.0973186328117
looks seemed to have made an impression on her.	361.7166921655513
The carriage went on, and left the two men facing each other; no	315.4415592855795
material obstacle separated them.	380.0438061218931
The cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but	456.24822867880505
D’Artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by	489.8672646545408
recognizing in him the Englishman of Amiens who had won his horse and	430.4141586223871
had been very near winning his diamond of Athos, caught at his bridle	301.7395346482699
and stopped him.	371.4162816539655
“Well, monsieur,” said he, “you appear to be more stupid than I am, for	455.4234621304445
you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two.”	402.8023902569328
“Ah,” said the Englishman, “is it you, my master? It seems you must	337.43560692539063
always be playing some game or other.”	446.2801385500966
“Yes; and that reminds me that I have a revenge to take. We will see,	429.53798733969126
my dear monsieur, if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a	348.30062609774103
dice box.”	321.2453362603443
“You see plainly that I have no sword,” said the Englishman. “Do you	362.42852471855616
wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?”	341.61397367511
“I hope you have a sword at home; but at all events, I have two, and if	442.25952646360247
you like, I will throw with you for one of them.”	444.2188118375167
“Needless,” said the Englishman; “I am well furnished with such	422.0472029063935
playthings.”	322.53654286056803
“Very well, my worthy gentleman,” replied D’Artagnan, “pick out the	292.98857118916777
longest, and come and show it to me this evening.”	309.95493359316754
“Where, if you please?”	405.45532640621843
“Behind the Luxembourg; that’s a charming spot for such amusements as	443.19177249042303
the one I propose to you.”	403.22250050372446
“That will do; I will be there.”	401.5406001281703
“Your hour?”	295.9443216765706
“Six o’clock.”	404.7425964655589
“_A propos_, you have probably one or two friends?”	417.0749227224554
“I have three, who would be honored by joining in the sport with me.”	301.1267663743878
“Three? Marvelous! That falls out oddly! Three is just my number!”	334.90236153852925
“Now, then, who are you?” asked the Englishman.	421.4234945262498
“I am Monsieur d’Artagnan, a Gascon gentleman, serving in the king’s	428.81919365425426
Musketeers. And you?”	333.5248409777229
“I am Lord de Winter, Baron Sheffield.”	306.3298828179313
“Well, then, I am your servant, Monsieur Baron,” said D’Artagnan,	311.85062686493364
“though you have names rather difficult to recollect.” And touching his	373.2921869785212
horse with the spur, he cantered back to Paris. As he was accustomed to	389.7270192436716
do in all cases of any consequence, D’Artagnan went straight to the	372.2128254393824
residence of Athos.	416.53928385413406
He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he	294.5466855656951
said, for his outfit to come and find him. He related to Athos all that	295.3954041587769
had passed, except the letter to M. de Wardes.	369.0921109622745
Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman. We	489.3105905436479
might say that was his dream.	429.4241217055172
They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis, and on	489.3801489984904
their arrival made them acquainted with the situation.	457.08675523638715
Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,	363.33712907318005
springing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.	441.23930905190656
Aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in	436.9867212329675
Athos’s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of	426.7746648349462
drawing swords.	390.0907550153046
Athos, by signs, desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.	488.5806418233468
D’Artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we	482.83545823443626
shall hereafter see the execution, and which promised him some	417.5097772366531
agreeable adventure, as might be seen by the smiles which from time to	399.9565216136727
time passed over his countenance, whose thoughtfulness they animated.	297.6875992995046
Chapter XXXI.	461.0986744545693
ENGLISH AND FRENCH	415.225856084099
The hour having come, they went with their four lackeys to a spot	420.60834758621144
behind the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats. Athos threw a	487.20422330096125
piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw. The lackeys were ordered	462.6343606904726
to act as sentinels.	390.7311905196739
A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure, entered, and	316.78047839237615
joined the Musketeers. Then, according to foreign custom, the	491.6925252016232
presentations took place.	425.82961476675723
The Englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of	323.7846415345201
their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of	473.6815801692648
annoyance.	351.59255021782064
“But after all,” said Lord de Winter, when the three friends had been	400.6129882141169
named, “we do not know who you are. We cannot fight with such names;	355.3808758023606
they are names of shepherds.”	314.0912869693132
“Therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names,” said	381.744524695721
Athos.	306.2678658891991
“Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones,” replied	440.5476038900472
the Englishman.	472.7387694567884
“You played very willingly with us without knowing our names,” said	368.33405991365606
Athos, “by the same token that you won our horses.”	311.6234897154992
“That is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk	449.2586044899556
our blood. One plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals.”	466.29118856433763
“And that is but just,” said Athos, and he took aside the one of the	302.720861676565
four Englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in	457.50596334153937
a low voice.	452.80754927246915
Porthos and Aramis did the same.	459.32850477714817
“Does that satisfy you?” said Athos to his adversary. “Do you find me	325.5750583668045
of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?”	448.68692457761256
“Yes, monsieur,” said the Englishman, bowing.	292.61822635124236
“Well! now shall I tell you something?” added Athos, coolly.	349.0132912442799
“What?” replied the Englishman.	443.18571764009675
“Why, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not	351.26541352453216
required me to make myself known.”	393.4022869792466
“Why so?”	449.4727570019873
“Because I am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody	359.61608325284215
to know I am living; so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent	466.735394041091
my secret from roaming over the fields.”	347.38060586482607
The Englishman looked at Athos, believing that he jested, but Athos did	407.2887150386192
not jest the least in the world.	425.3219375790078
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, addressing at the same time his companions and	467.22102296315205
their adversaries, “are we ready?”	308.2993343848093
“Yes!” answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen, as with one voice.	399.09306526743256
“On guard, then!” cried Athos.	385.7120966897589
Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and	352.1169095585324
the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice	335.3799188952527
enemies.	344.02235615239454
Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been	427.1196631656279
practicing in a fencing school.	454.6446752660821
Porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure	397.60050355498
of Chantilly, played with skill and prudence. Aramis, who had the third	473.4252884312455
canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.	340.9999354922704
Athos killed his adversary first. He hit him but once, but as he had	370.9205366525489
foretold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.	339.1148662707793
Second, Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his	466.0034722240778
thigh, As the Englishman, without making any further resistance, then	373.89224929832454
surrendered his sword, Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to	339.6882985320909
his carriage.	408.9207499774461
Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces, the	409.262570488085
man ended by fairly taking to his heels, and disappeared amid the	422.1852159080562
hooting of the lackeys.	383.20917125933613
As to D’Artagnan, he fought purely and simply on the defensive; and	343.3149741351782
when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued, with a vigorous side	476.10765776615955
thrust sent his sword flying. The baron, finding himself disarmed, took	346.0061464617543
two or three steps back, but in this movement his foot slipped and he	363.378346568528
fell backward.	472.7549203132623
D’Artagnan was over him at a bound, and said to the Englishman,	479.53904586372784
pointing his sword to his throat, “I could kill you, my Lord, you are	368.5252841466554
completely in my hands; but I spare your life for the sake of your	305.92973531097056
sister.”	342.1247613253146
D’Artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had	445.64662164639856
imagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted	473.8351125066388
upon his face.	418.76746928316584
The Englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a	316.2045258824387
kind disposition, pressed D’Artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand	295.2392027622133
compliments to the three Musketeers, and as Porthos’s adversary was	309.7403179475289
already installed in the carriage, and as Aramis’s had taken to his	302.8391346085476
heels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.	385.3172429906195
As Porthos and Aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his	330.53442834430496
wound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. D’Artagnan	317.6512381002417
picked it up and offered it to Lord de Winter.	430.09307151468477
“What the devil would you have me do with that?” said the Englishman.	409.21939369738067
“You can restore it to his family,” said D’Artagnan.	304.753450043445
“His family will care much about such a trifle as that! His family will	360.20395086065344
inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him. Keep the purse for your	484.22720963838344
lackeys.”	389.50330241542997
D’Artagnan put the purse into his pocket.	298.1895437825674
“And now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you	425.24177021787943
that name,” said Lord de Winter, “on this very evening, if agreeable to	425.60057495788504
you, I will present you to my sister, Milady Clarik, for I am desirous	320.24100471703184
that she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad	316.3875541479076
odor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that	396.0626833537231
will not prove useless to you.”	353.32718610300526
D’Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.	309.5973505040914
At this time Athos came up to D’Artagnan.	383.3751904094224
“What do you mean to do with that purse?” whispered he.	382.76144933490104
“Why, I meant to pass it over to you, my dear Athos.”	397.94630858464103
“Me! why to me?”	438.6846718029228
“Why, you killed him! They are the spoils of victory.”	412.78547869584025
“I, the heir of an enemy!” said Athos; “for whom, then, do you take	364.6699252508523
me?”	419.7954975207375
“It is the custom in war,” said D’Artagnan, “why should it not be the	448.00087916068446
custom in a duel?”	452.2497731284891
“Even on the field of battle, I have never done that.”	390.2962560623807
Porthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips	367.4906678450635
endorsed Athos.	359.51743633955084
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, “let us give the money to the lackeys, as Lord	488.44172547834853
de Winter desired us to do.”	362.78417338077605
“Yes,” said Athos; “let us give the money to the lackeys—not to our	384.2176556893136
lackeys, but to the lackeys of the Englishmen.”	453.8691822257347
Athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. “For	327.3681351132701
you and your comrades.”	424.77054393641777
This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even	450.2950848784997
Porthos; and this French generosity, repeated by Lord de Winter and his	350.15542659554137
friend, was highly applauded, except by MM. Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton	409.3904787886032
and Planchet.	309.18848347745916
Lord de Winter, on quitting D’Artagnan, gave him his sister’s address.	334.1072280019257
She lived in the Place Royale—then the fashionable quarter—at Number 6,	329.11647372462835
and he undertook to call and take D’Artagnan with him in order to	365.6174472791986
introduce him. D’Artagnan appointed eight o’clock at Athos’s residence.	398.8900482246357
This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon	399.66284551422484
greatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto	466.2675679191534
been mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was some	485.33270996082854
creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn	474.9799092713175
toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His	396.39183814430316
only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and	402.5813873740855
of Dover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de	457.1645804265072
Tréville, and consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king;	486.2816263365712
which would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to	483.20629579332694
Milady as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. As to the	310.1397255846157
commencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our	293.231319275644
presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis	407.77918552194075
was young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal’s favor. It is not	454.12440044333016
for nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at	336.7555245020387
Tarbes.	384.7470612674632
D’Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to	428.38512175336393
Athos’s, and according to custom, related everything to him. Athos	491.13744800761924
listened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence	322.0263977843149
to him with a shade of bitterness.	346.1715498092079
“What!” said he, “you have just lost one woman, whom you call good,	389.23586544837065
charming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another.”	338.4711800908428
D’Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.	299.4584431694107
“I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with	442.85168678790524
my head,” said he. “In getting introduced to her, my principal object	384.37719804462904
is to ascertain what part she plays at court.”	322.1210358397464
“The part she plays, _pardieu!_ It is not difficult to divine that,	444.12095423852395
after all you have told me. She is some emissary of the cardinal; a	335.4804078556553
woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your	374.0762394590515
head.”	424.7583102629501
“The devil! my dear Athos, you view things on the dark side, methinks.”	483.30430267933025
“My dear fellow, I mistrust women. Can it be otherwise? I bought my	396.3411557345627
experience dearly—particularly fair women. Milady is fair, you say?”	304.28424353440835
“She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable!”	481.6635324638694
“Ah, my poor D’Artagnan!” said Athos.	477.3338351252527
“Listen to me! I want to be enlightened on a subject; then, when I	403.98085193225086
shall have learned what I desire to know, I will withdraw.”	482.69155246825835
“Be enlightened!” said Athos, phlegmatically.	454.5253790392985
Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time; but Athos, being warned	377.668971850555
of his coming, went into the other chamber. He therefore found	370.98716793166074
D’Artagnan alone, and as it was nearly eight o’clock he took the young	358.2546007754727
man with him.	461.13861315326994
An elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent	301.7382865098209
horses, they were soon at the Place Royale.	394.2425561622238
Milady Clarik received D’Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hôtel was	421.1619357599101
remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit,	379.457105313633
or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just	334.2666478763381
been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the	417.41940503447324
general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her.	361.74582981780515
“You see,” said Lord de Winter, presenting D’Artagnan to his sister, “a	445.5320031806783
young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not	304.2122588071074
abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it	459.1837579760049
was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him,	343.73653542532435
then, madame, if you have any affection for me.”	429.14501612852075
Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow,	345.7548457124083
and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who	315.02532864595184
saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it.	424.84308213089446
The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with	398.3248913123022
Milady’s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.	387.90833117733456
“You are welcome, monsieur,” said Milady, in a voice whose singular	401.23718354296966
sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which D’Artagnan	331.0685668755123
had just remarked; “you have today acquired eternal rights to my	435.8582527125252
gratitude.”	382.7080965319808
The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without	382.5844725624878
omitting a single detail. Milady listened with the greatest attention,	395.9974276892152
and yet it was easily to be perceived, whatever effort she made to	339.36853552337277
conceal her impressions, that this recital was not agreeable to her.	298.68208574562146
The blood rose to her head, and her little foot worked with impatience	316.9584739438762
beneath her robe.	418.3819153278337
Lord de Winter perceived nothing of this. When he had finished, he went	445.52654117483587
to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses. He	326.7343105995352
filled two glasses, and by a sign invited D’Artagnan to drink.	322.5120023597242
D’Artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to	334.81786739327333
refuse to pledge him. He therefore drew near to the table and took the	481.2189440174121
second glass. He did not, however, lose sight of Milady, and in a	368.28278092215885
mirror he perceived the change that came over her face. Now that she	337.2859370899441
believed herself to be no longer observed, a sentiment resembling	396.0180311358845
ferocity animated her countenance. She bit her handkerchief with her	389.11786501805176
beautiful teeth.	396.6848767074142
That pretty little _soubrette_ whom D’Artagnan had already observed	307.21188494413417
then came in. She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English, who	435.90258818527485
thereupon requested D’Artagnan’s permission to retire, excusing himself	292.50447778883296
on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away, and	312.4322681376692
charging his sister to obtain his pardon.	419.9374716930668
D’Artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter, and then	361.50932208335706
returned to Milady. Her countenance, with surprising mobility, had	478.51898075916915
recovered its gracious expression; but some little red spots on her	344.558957402361
handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood	337.0395952758387
came. Those lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral.	360.0375287250674
The conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely	387.53078830933396
recovered. She told D’Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her	361.16195110077075
brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother	439.639892999385
of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was	460.504277825818
the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All	364.2402529641247
this showed D’Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something;	330.183051003468
but he could not yet see under this veil.	393.1972934437754
In addition to this, after a half hour’s conversation D’Artagnan was	359.87958812008685
convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an	363.7654714222592
elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head.	298.3006698601804
D’Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of	396.7479848504681
devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady	463.6652752265387
replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire.	488.7687725321664
D’Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of	437.2687163905756
men.	390.2295137953899
On the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_, who brushed gently	402.86468685631957
against him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his	342.9561418001566
pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was	345.5501030423031
granted instantly.	475.81020511377983
D’Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than	479.55234760697107
on the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was	417.2983891961548
Milady who this time did all the honors of the evening. She appeared to	384.20813542250824
take a great interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his	457.41408990094527
friends, and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself	466.32477584368576
to the cardinal.	323.9591418237842
D’Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young	351.8912088159554
man of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady. He	440.2374964366369
launched into a eulogy of his Eminence, and said that he should not	309.66065453541285
have failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the	451.2645947500698
king’s Guards if he had happened to know M. de Cavois instead of M. de	469.79087707985076
Tréville.	300.55789935128695
Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation,	440.4807464314209
and asked D’Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had	302.040373983588
ever been in England.	395.7069065365961
D’Artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by M. de Tréville to	297.19584539265304
treat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as	410.83972321872767
specimens.	485.0196188878044
Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips;	332.88310419534156
she had to deal with a Gascon who played close.	423.66897176377825
At the same hour as on the preceding evening, D’Artagnan retired. In	394.54096884168143
the corridor he again met the pretty Kitty; that was the name of the	452.7180399362029
_soubrette_. She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it	362.7243842374281
was impossible to mistake; but D’Artagnan was so preoccupied by the	311.6058218374967
mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.	374.624038700698
D’Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each	321.9569328508393
day Milady gave him a more gracious reception.	316.1090822052487
Every evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the	405.18586612976924
stairs, he met the pretty _soubrette_. But, as we have said, D’Artagnan	479.6515608920379
paid no attention to this persistence of poor Kitty.	341.58077618886654
Chapter XXXII.	307.0095411062402
A PROCURATOR’S DINNER	487.4917870869528
However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it	396.19385814372947
had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator’s wife.	439.4432275798953
On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousqueton’s brush for an	420.57686848951613
hour, and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man	456.12772568482416
who was doubly in favor with fortune.	371.45216073463473
His heart beat, but not like D’Artagnan’s with a young and impatient	426.2253470661776
love. No; a more material interest stirred his blood. He was about at	292.8305778037112
last to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs	411.6516771987782
by which, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended. He	408.24134858468346
was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty	352.06829054842956
times beheld the image in his dreams—a coffer long and deep, locked,	401.49764743535525
bolted, fastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard,	413.30250330308775
and which the hands—a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not	489.9337504517912
without elegance—of the procurator’s wife were about to open to his	409.7546906849968
admiring looks.	437.06819899336153
And then he—a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man	437.4239355219735
without family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and	376.8599833652508
restaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats—was	326.9298305996533
about to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a	362.85015837562804
comfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little	320.89963061137786
attentions which “the harder one is, the more they please,” as old	370.6059061669985
soldiers say.	475.08047969714437
To come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a	322.95585257080677
good table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator;	447.4513037824333
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them _bassette_, _passe-dix_,	448.2963665731919
and _lansquenet_, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way	398.0138049468252
of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a	440.53998862340717
month—all this was enormously delightful to Porthos.	485.17693152359027
The Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed,	416.7255071885768
and which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the	485.76109228627223
period—meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some	395.3014398072364
few acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable,	463.78717365750674
the procurator’s wife had been tolerably liberal—that is, be it	423.14431318624963
understood, for a procurator’s wife—he hoped to see a household of a	328.38675373169605
highly comfortable kind.	321.6062765526065
And yet, at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts.	324.3461272360975
The approach was not such as to prepossess people—an ill-smelling, dark	407.21381267373613
passage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer	300.2684505886843
from a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with	375.0613652036792
enormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Châtelet.	451.3351581496687
Porthos knocked with his hand. A tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a	397.79776530776473
forest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a man	410.7728678389937
forced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated	420.24788510424094
strength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy	426.2152697577966
countenance, which indicated familiarity with good living.	320.4788012730354
A shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the	303.15539799449493
second, a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. In all,	413.5995723694058
three clerks and a half, which, for the time, argued a very extensive	411.2047084137805
clientage.	450.860817478998
Although the Musketeer was not expected before one o’clock, the	365.98577408440633
procurator’s wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning	377.220714675631
that the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him	298.52221491923973
before his time.	368.3792342138395
Mme. Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same	431.53637199017993
moment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the	437.36438303575756
worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. The clerks	341.66140490362034
surveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say	335.58067450488613
to this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied.	417.35223271896376
“It is my cousin!” cried the procurator’s wife. “Come in, come in,	358.5185280307126
Monsieur Porthos!”	344.3970460658145
The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to	489.3837252518613
laugh; but Porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly	430.6535243289973
recovered its gravity.	352.2378337203904
They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through	391.53119115960925
the antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they	326.19589768876017
ought to have been. This last apartment was a sort of dark room,	484.0020004404784
littered with papers. On quitting the study they left the kitchen on	344.4808382478083
the right, and entered the reception room.	458.87201279601936
All these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire	331.99304366628576
Porthos favorably. Words might be heard at a distance through all these	377.3491135712939
open doors. Then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating	457.3532136767663
glance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to	465.6836264221587
the shame of the procurator’s wife and his own regret, that he did not	364.6691499563773
see that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is	339.883147437393
on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living.	325.75740277366316
The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he	395.184708661407
expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him	389.31386786903266
with a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.	331.6331550668739
“We are cousins, it appears, Monsieur Porthos?” said the procurator,	466.1823521764497
rising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.	399.00010328950134
The old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of	379.1692706507426
his slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. His little gray eyes	475.8716275503747
shone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the	311.16668509935676
only part of his face in which life survived. Unfortunately the legs	371.80771482373683
began to refuse their service to this bony machine. During the last	440.8825646878602
five or six months that this weakness had been felt, the worthy	437.3587315609549
procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife.	432.0053945098538
The cousin was received with resignation, that was all. M. Coquenard,	295.3123672640444
firm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with M.	370.6751432957798
Porthos.	368.5902140637601
“Yes, monsieur, we are cousins,” said Porthos, without being	407.912657898274
disconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received	305.4270107633203
enthusiastically by the husband.	446.9590853244468
“By the female side, I believe?” said the procurator, maliciously.	468.0984327062125
Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of	418.6537257095403
simplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. Mme. Coquenard,	364.1662824988674
who knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the	324.8306601673591
species, smiled a little, and colored a great deal.	409.9200930075951
M. Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his	470.4887120152992
eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his	381.33154679566906
oak desk. Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not	379.92786387559204
correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be	380.4309739451438
the blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was	414.91485876739114
several feet higher than the dream.	379.6462173197135
M. Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further;	481.9373744015845
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon	336.59975350247134
Porthos, he contented himself with saying, “Monsieur our cousin will do	431.9477530879709
us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the	465.4540367035007
campaign, will he not, Madame Coquenard?”	347.4723246522268
This time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.	298.2748917162732
It appeared likewise that Mme. Coquenard was not less affected by it on	415.9890003323824
her part, for she added, “My cousin will not return if he finds that we	315.6634691584392
do not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in	433.09551829794293
Paris, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to	313.44496857644634
give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure.”	402.6060144371101
“Oh, my legs, my poor legs! where are you?” murmured Coquenard, and he	299.31132498371426
tried to smile.	424.5200057265725
This succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was	426.9734402139112
attacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the	312.9702351900697
Musketeer toward the procurator’s wife.	364.8269114800413
The hour of dinner soon arrived. They passed into the eating room—a	486.7006567467189
large dark room situated opposite the kitchen.	447.5473902875239
The clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the	380.48349902819285
house, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand	384.23633947103997
quite ready to sit down. Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful	483.1017969924817
threatenings.	340.63420746653384
“Indeed!” thought Porthos, casting a glance at the three hungry	390.270882159159
clerks—for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to	406.165023007075
the honors of the magisterial table, “in my cousin’s place, I would not	428.4359404966996
keep such gourmands! They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not	324.2028622128754
eaten for six weeks.”	339.707318456008
M. Coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by	301.01744853579646
Mme. Coquenard, whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the	471.9819402675017
table. He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and	304.05246023686647
his jaws after the example of his clerks.	312.10549542227955
“Oh, oh!” said he; “here is a soup which is rather inviting.”	435.0569829843405
“What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?” said	460.6612451669797
Porthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from	388.65682633912877
meat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the	387.38964264563793
islands of an archipelago.	299.6586101206821
Mme. Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took	373.79979980934706
his seat.	347.1240549082427
M. Coquenard was served first, then Porthos. Afterward Mme. Coquenard	453.3823245273957
filled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the	458.75854191769076
impatient clerks. At this moment the door of the dining room unclosed	296.95814263126687
with a creak, and Porthos perceived through the half-open flap the	479.02946851160414
little clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his	386.46737787208366
dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and	470.2101885139955
kitchen.	394.6123798344456
After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl—a piece of magnificence	411.0215482918908
which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that	377.54501900573194
they seemed ready to burst.	490.1164301578083
“One may see that you love your family, Madame Coquenard,” said the	452.71006560099187
procurator, with a smile that was almost tragic. “You are certainly	376.67570390679117
treating your cousin very handsomely!”	300.26621427206766
The poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly	403.64571993594325
skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.	474.85892299248076
The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which	459.57614843317594
it had retired to die of old age.	301.7715314190582
“The devil!” thought Porthos, “this is poor work. I respect old age,	315.89634808830033
but I don’t much like it boiled or roasted.”	422.0462019015141
And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on	436.17317162661
the contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in	386.5414571576588
anticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.	395.72870967981066
Mme. Coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two	335.3851942243343
great black feet, which she placed upon her husband’s plate, cut off	299.3246642446538
the neck, which with the head she put on one side for herself, raised	378.96848893994513
the wing for Porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to	405.7794937693708
the servant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the	479.55861353427827
Musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment	385.71371734399554
produces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of	485.1395802266206
those who experience it.	363.8591900406097
In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance—an	483.7860716090669
enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one	300.15740212659864
might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show	397.4516678395971
themselves.	408.24094861666765
But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious	353.652730930372
looks settled down into resigned countenances.	466.4430411476689
Mme. Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the	305.0296225895067
moderation of a good housewife.	353.1163400415311
The time for wine came. M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone	372.82480363791353
bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself	486.2086056500935
in about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.	412.0930805095451
Coquenard.	445.8290725020746
The young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when	457.9005833607051
they had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued	439.62369400136936
to do so. This brought them, by the end of the repast, to swallowing a	359.501188349871
drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale	410.28221777661304
topaz.	485.78078951340694
Porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly, and shuddered when he felt	358.5715432357452
the knee of the procurator’s wife under the table, as it came in search	429.13079179306226
of his. He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine, and	429.89903920974734
found it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuil—the terror of all	299.2900555422475
expert palates.	475.0154191139377
M. Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted, and sighed deeply.	463.395857845784
“Will you eat any of these beans, Cousin Porthos?” said Mme. Coquenard,	465.1812942510851
in that tone which says, “Take my advice, don’t touch them.”	353.90597755729834
“Devil take me if I taste one of them!” murmured Porthos to himself,	296.75702839283787
and then said aloud, “Thank you, my cousin, I am no longer hungry.”	354.93999073217634
There was silence. Porthos could hardly keep his countenance.	421.6492110833227
The procurator repeated several times, “Ah, Madame Coquenard! Accept my	377.37452509957745
compliments; your dinner has been a real feast. Lord, how I have	415.6714782552425
eaten!”	367.04654650124826
M. Coquenard had eaten his soup, the black feet of the fowl, and the	442.7383758399129
only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat.	323.0159404576864
Porthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his	411.31397577101217
mustache and knit his eyebrows; but the knee of Mme. Coquenard gently	404.5222094977382
advised him to be patient.	303.93944363193094
This silence and this interruption in serving, which were	325.61918673401027
unintelligible to Porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for	443.0684806012145
the clerks. Upon a look from the procurator, accompanied by a smile	423.17217901106557
from Mme. Coquenard, they arose slowly from the table, folded their	325.2771632901453
napkins more slowly still, bowed, and retired.	431.11054810972126
“Go, young men! go and promote digestion by working,” said the	471.0922918550168
procurator, gravely.	314.749465618762
The clerks gone, Mme. Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of	340.7417859541613
cheese, some preserved quinces, and a cake which she had herself made	488.48075624806995
of almonds and honey.	453.86471679255476
M. Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things.	382.0268531987365
Porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine. He	421.90031820827346
looked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans	467.0700883124812
had disappeared.	461.25220622634924
“A positive feast!” cried M. Coquenard, turning about in his chair, “a	410.95327083818995
real feast, _epulœ epulorum_. Lucullus dines with Lucullus.”	332.377936793142
Porthos looked at the bottle, which was near him, and hoped that with	488.5612550043905
wine, bread, and cheese, he might make a dinner; but wine was wanting,	387.135257157223
the bottle was empty. M. and Mme. Coquenard did not seem to observe it.	491.98757748703645
“This is fine!” said Porthos to himself; “I am prettily caught!”	475.89374638282186
He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves, and stuck his teeth	474.11164391639807
into the sticky pastry of Mme. Coquenard.	317.8359184727159
“Now,” said he, “the sacrifice is consummated! Ah! if I had not the	340.80258722803256
hope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husband’s chest!”	402.1095414439565
M. Coquenard, after the luxuries of such a repast, which he called an	448.62903382240916
excess, felt the want of a siesta. Porthos began to hope that the thing	436.0775077360354
would take place at the present sitting, and in that same locality; but	347.0935379359678
the procurator would listen to nothing, he would be taken to his room,	369.21394917066584
and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest, upon the edge of	303.43904796634615
which, for still greater precaution, he placed his feet.	399.31590247375175
The procurator’s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they	380.79239647322015
began to lay the basis of a reconciliation.	481.03841299979103
“You can come and dine three times a week,” said Mme. Coquenard.	355.5616899475872
“Thanks, madame!” said Porthos, “but I don’t like to abuse your	424.25120812943646
kindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!”	403.10420788243846
“That’s true,” said the procurator’s wife, groaning, “that unfortunate	335.8412284808635
outfit!”	428.0263428474125
“Alas, yes,” said Porthos, “it is so.”	392.6058590703118
“But of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist,	399.5684870549511
Monsieur Porthos?”	397.22951720417853
“Oh, of many things!” said Porthos. “The Musketeers are, as you know,	358.5326932543494
picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen	367.32823631287624
or the Swiss.”	317.59204750042886
“But yet, detail them to me.”	447.62079897100705
“Why, they may amount to—“, said Porthos, who preferred discussing the	489.4507927268827
total to taking them one by one.	367.4521129593361
The procurator’s wife waited tremblingly.	365.2003712027631
“To how much?” said she. “I hope it does not exceed—” She stopped;	416.6292524804272
speech failed her.	456.5130416402864
“Oh, no,” said Porthos, “it does not exceed two thousand five hundred	389.6564776763793
livres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two	381.9256689314127
thousand livres.”	297.721194110069
“Good God!” cried she, “two thousand livres! Why, that is a fortune!”	413.83371926044964
Porthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it.	318.98618760078597
“I wished to know the detail,” said she, “because, having many	361.04039054015215
relatives in business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a	314.08408492894785
hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself.”	435.3255286852534
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “that is what you meant to say!”	396.9016295215205
“Yes, dear Monsieur Porthos. Thus, for instance, don’t you in the first	447.3685088245692
place want a horse?”	458.65783338160793
“Yes, a horse.”	377.04472087895135
“Well, then! I can just suit you.”	428.8891386458302
“Ah!” said Porthos, brightening, “that’s well as regards my horse; but	422.4000977646771
I must have the appointments complete, as they include objects which a	468.45060456377337
Musketeer alone can purchase, and which will not amount, besides, to	322.7787638721743
more than three hundred livres.”	392.19157228029997
“Three hundred livres? Then put down three hundred livres,” said the	430.86235452835103
procurator’s wife, with a sigh.	432.393284299703
Porthos smiled. It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came	427.87332983296324
from Buckingham. These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting	309.3273450173763
snugly into his pocket.	300.7979340308974
“Then,” continued he, “there is a horse for my lackey, and my valise.	309.39066422467505
As to my arms, it is useless to trouble you about them; I have them.”	350.05547587527917
“A horse for your lackey?” resumed the procurator’s wife, hesitatingly;	362.73578318566877
“but that is doing things in lordly style, my friend.”	345.1430294334048
“Ah, madame!” said Porthos, haughtily; “do you take me for a beggar?”	429.413003818033
“No; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an	362.3892913838965
appearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty	434.7892998940115
mule for Mousqueton—”	317.39098952048295
“Well, agreed for a pretty mule,” said Porthos; “you are right, I have	394.2176669518998
seen very great Spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules.	363.09272414243003
But then you understand, Madame Coquenard, a mule with feathers and	448.6374526930621
bells.”	402.19955520597665
“Be satisfied,” said the procurator’s wife.	475.05040188073247
“There remains the valise,” added Porthos.	382.5559375017317
“Oh, don’t let that disturb you,” cried Mme. Coquenard. “My husband has	416.9015741471816
five or six valises; you shall choose the best. There is one in	370.62577597122214
particular which he prefers in his journeys, large enough to hold all	365.5627395480757
the world.”	319.9916411348447
“Your valise is then empty?” asked Porthos, with simplicity.	436.8682074616549
“Certainly it is empty,” replied the procurator’s wife, in real	383.7178012986765
innocence.	426.2679561533769
“Ah, but the valise I want,” cried Porthos, “is a well-filled one, my	300.897236884421
dear.”	427.1851514647046
Madame uttered fresh sighs. Molière had not written his scene in	442.93806978305247
“L’Avare” then. Mme. Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harpagan.	468.1459542311569
Finally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same	309.405205813244
manner; and the result of the sitting was that the procurator’s wife	305.46352349682087
should give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the horse	427.24146094405177
and the mule which should have the honor of carrying Porthos and	344.3846848343423
Mousqueton to glory.	394.82986236091403
These conditions being agreed to, Porthos took leave of Mme. Coquenard.	298.3849638926995
The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but	429.9412224757555
Porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procurator’s wife was	348.5744379491349
obliged to give place to the king.	384.8392874759048
The Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.	361.5169404255752
Chapter XXXIII.	489.3713886825276
SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS	322.27110201793215
Meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the	384.3753187904533
wise counsels of Athos, D’Artagnan became hourly more in love with	378.859342632243
Milady. Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the	402.9473790405107
self-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not	453.9594505000052
fail to respond.	336.38253606322405
One day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at	303.86301488244635
heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the _soubrette_	307.51669575174884
under the gateway of the hôtel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not	489.08654544043577
contented with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the	392.2510575477861
hand.	309.13556925443555
“Good!” thought D’Artagnan, “She is charged with some message for me	482.08572604987074
from her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she	361.30498857635087
had not courage to speak.” And he looked down at the pretty girl with	441.72678340807283
the most triumphant air imaginable.	360.21018895468745
“I wish to say three words to you, Monsieur Chevalier,” stammered the	333.9230305618978
_soubrette_.	467.8437142548728
“Speak, my child, speak,” said D’Artagnan; “I listen.”	374.90380231062807
“Here? Impossible! That which I have to say is too long, and above all,	367.2157569955647
too secret.”	324.75784302420027
“Well, what is to be done?”	353.92346359127185
“If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me?” said Kitty, timidly.	408.7967156771772
“Where you please, my dear child.”	317.36776223189617
“Come, then.”	430.87748737274967
And Kitty, who had not let go the hand of D’Artagnan, led him up a	377.98835241282256
little dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen	384.46436711311145
steps, opened a door.	414.6258813553622
“Come in here, Monsieur Chevalier,” said she; “here we shall be alone,	372.1229373853742
and can talk.”	375.56627162393914
“And whose room is this, my dear child?”	423.92920855979946
“It is mine, Monsieur Chevalier; it communicates with my mistress’s by	312.4133308877751
that door. But you need not fear. She will not hear what we say; she	400.1598651094447
never goes to bed before midnight.”	327.22769213202946
D’Artagnan cast a glance around him. The little apartment was charming	461.04979099498655
for its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were	473.9614034805319
directed to that door which Kitty said led to Milady’s chamber.	488.2695001787922
Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved	477.057717520446
a deep sigh.	422.6661682070463
“You love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?” said	425.9062192333447
she.	407.92317434317033
“Oh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!”	393.3716960973751
Kitty breathed a second sigh.	309.4427765157307
“Alas, monsieur,” said she, “that is too bad.”	414.68432108311094
“What the devil do you see so bad in it?” said D’Artagnan.	368.955504206183
“Because, monsieur,” replied Kitty, “my mistress loves you not at all.”	397.72068049244376
“_Hein!_” said D’Artagnan, “can she have charged you to tell me so?”	381.1050842028386
“Oh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken	428.46776303651666
the resolution to tell you so.”	381.8934492688178
“Much obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only—for the	423.53635523747715
information, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.”	404.82256095942256
“That is to say, you don’t believe what I have told you; is it not so?”	474.90941089101045
“We have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty	447.3830406385497
dear, were it only from self-love.”	406.15162595628647
“Then you don’t believe me?”	460.6713015805112
“I confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you	301.6164825127164
advance—”	435.1599128822711
“What do you think of this?”	344.9617103957198
Kitty drew a little note from her bosom.	321.69804774121553
“For me?” said D’Artagnan, seizing the letter.	430.18887458701363
“No; for another.”	473.62433206028095
“For another?”	369.1224728607625
“Yes.”	383.23104031263733
“His name; his name!” cried D’Artagnan.	415.3114854450414
“Read the address.”	487.0147149529279
“Monsieur El Comte de Wardes.”	486.8378586367181
The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the	336.1630360917448
mind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the	465.0516402819097
letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was	298.9019756479927
going to do, or rather, what he was doing.	453.59969433054357
“Oh, good Lord, Monsieur Chevalier,” said she, “what are you doing?”	400.7008627282443
“I?” said D’Artagnan; “nothing,” and he read,	454.8520758934535
“You have not answered my first note. Are you indisposed, or have you	404.3032163973384
forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of Mme. de Guise?	409.6715480287831
You have an opportunity now, Count; do not allow it to escape.”	400.9914171038223
D’Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his _self_-love: he	431.1584530882782
thought that it was in his _love_.	460.69300644565396
“Poor dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Kitty, in a voice full of	465.8600503410119
compassion, and pressing anew the young man’s hand.	327.6671159728846
“You pity me, little one?” said D’Artagnan.	354.47169454113106
“Oh, yes, and with all my heart; for I know what it is to be in love.”	367.32271175288247
“You know what it is to be in love?” said D’Artagnan, looking at her	454.6756122213127
for the first time with much attention.	464.3964763884117
“Alas, yes.”	337.7046013742892
“Well, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist	303.3819259970034
me in avenging myself on your mistress.”	352.8802891343637
“And what sort of revenge would you take?”	418.19677184575323
“I would triumph over her, and supplant my rival.”	352.95521367435424
“I will never help you in that, Monsieur Chevalier,” said Kitty,	471.6012635537701
warmly.	441.3134351343822
“And why not?” demanded D’Artagnan.	464.616263191361
“For two reasons.”	338.1913672102645
“What ones?”	466.77565154161675
“The first is that my mistress will never love you.”	457.34780312726025
“How do you know that?”	362.102562292558
“You have cut her to the heart.”	294.98087014201155
“I? In what can I have offended her—I who ever since I have known her	336.61339697277424
have lived at her feet like a slave? Speak, I beg you!”	361.0986521867832
“I will never confess that but to the man—who should read to the bottom	426.8252075166104
of my soul!”	403.21336995424485
D’Artagnan looked at Kitty for the second time. The young girl had	330.36547027633594
freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with	358.9134697214689
their coronets.	306.87812830279324
“Kitty,” said he, “I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you	393.59911002950275
like; don’t let that disturb you.” And he gave her a kiss at which the	312.18196618926635
poor girl became as red as a cherry.	425.59881230738705
“Oh, no,” said Kitty, “it is not me you love! It is my mistress you	315.81428076403955
love; you told me so just now.”	367.9344486275059
“And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?”	361.75491633079383
“The second reason, Monsieur the Chevalier,” replied Kitty, emboldened	341.7437515060141
by the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of	387.87407557801833
the eyes of the young man, “is that in love, everyone for herself!”	415.438062754001
Then only D’Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her	488.1499879555347
constantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the	313.40119729160847
stairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep	474.7390198707974
sighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had	419.982601302976
disdained the _soubrette_. He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of	318.69060930710816
the sparrow.	308.34892052834687
But this time our Gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be	430.97122121412406
derived from the love which Kitty had just confessed so innocently, or	348.41266524960264
so boldly: the interception of letters addressed to the Comte de	311.5532525059869
Wardes, news on the spot, entrance at all hours into Kitty’s chamber,	313.6434618761052
which was contiguous to her mistress’s. The perfidious deceiver was, as	482.5289523090528
may plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor	478.2796802155374
girl in order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly.	313.7554793455763
“Well,” said he to the young girl, “are you willing, my dear Kitty,	471.439482006714
that I should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?”	303.33623167287385
“What love?” asked the young girl.	333.30590299393776
“Of that which I am ready to feel toward you.”	434.71694113187266
“And what is that proof?”	474.9368708535516
“Are you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I	387.674092079346
generally spend with your mistress?”	466.34924055776946
“Oh, yes,” said Kitty, clapping her hands, “very willing.”	317.2037780690629
“Well, then, come here, my dear,” said D’Artagnan, establishing himself	293.45815511020317
in an easy chair; “come, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest	334.58255307659704
_soubrette_ I ever saw!”	436.42590952139506
And he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked	366.68117944377815
nothing better than to believe him, did believe him. Nevertheless, to	320.181125080836
D’Artagnan’s great astonishment, the pretty Kitty defended herself	407.0606749684233
resolutely.	373.75009253998394
Time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. Midnight	360.4430687473006
sounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Milady’s	456.5861751335579
chamber.	396.1005533826275
“Good God,” cried Kitty, “there is my mistress calling me! Go; go	295.12714390549934
directly!”	386.9361214665814
D’Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey,	404.0323781326269
then, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that	370.59495389574414
leading to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing	327.1049140273734
gowns of Milady.	455.3365900107036
“What are you doing?” cried Kitty.	343.81844785783954
D’Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet	382.986590036199
without reply.	452.434162937372
“Well,” cried Milady, in a sharp voice. “Are you asleep, that you don’t	307.78376927510703
answer when I ring?”	332.05281633041676
And D’Artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently.	405.88990369163184
“Here am I, Milady, here am I!” cried Kitty, springing forward to meet	466.3826765755429
her mistress.	293.0426471577688
Both went into the bedroom, and as the door of communication remained	395.4588487404883
open, D’Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid. She	424.2316603603874
was at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while	305.30471809848535
Kitty was assisting her mistress.	325.5761969647699
“Well,” said Milady, “I have not seen our Gascon this evening.”	446.38711004459094
“What, Milady! has he not come?” said Kitty. “Can he be inconstant	356.2610988476779
before being happy?”	369.4636851054443
“Oh, no; he must have been prevented by Monsieur de Tréville or	385.5175568067075
Monsieur Dessessart. I understand my game, Kitty; I have this one	349.6036056916669
safe.”	333.9930295064538
“What will you do with him, madame?”	379.66895450633643
“What will I do with him? Be easy, Kitty, there is something between	448.3793551589267
that man and me that he is quite ignorant of: he nearly made me lose my	455.35842745157765
credit with his Eminence. Oh, I will be revenged!”	423.84468494616243
“I believed that Madame loved him.”	386.14824029273956
“I love him? I detest him! An idiot, who held the life of Lord de	372.3861046108883
Winter in his hands and did not kill him, by which I missed three	304.58304117414843
hundred thousand livres’ income.”	346.04437136188864
“That’s true,” said Kitty; “your son was the only heir of his uncle,	480.51321411352336
and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his	490.06208977002683
fortune.”	486.3218621357772
D’Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature	375.6153584943453
reproach him, with that sharp voice which she took such pains to	419.33890593896916
conceal in conversation, for not having killed a man whom he had seen	407.7949593609381
load her with kindnesses.	354.51865845996485
“For all this,” continued Milady, “I should long ago have revenged	396.20736424242546
myself on him if, and I don’t know why, the cardinal had not requested	297.53048898323186
me to conciliate him.”	444.4798333525464
“Oh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so	436.15140098594
fond of.”	445.0496584161583
“What, the mercer’s wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs? Has he not already	345.1648550361158
forgotten she ever existed? Fine vengeance that, on my faith!”	467.757987486404
A cold sweat broke from D’Artagnan’s brow. Why, this woman was a	404.4860750348744
monster! He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was	442.3489870843089
finished.	453.1622874443134
“That will do,” said Milady; “go into your own room, and tomorrow	384.20903102167557
endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave you.”	486.7997874535485
“For Monsieur de Wardes?” said Kitty.	440.13241102645543
“To be sure; for Monsieur de Wardes.”	477.21269652966345
“Now, there is one,” said Kitty, “who appears to me quite a different	348.7191593737938
sort of a man from that poor Monsieur d’Artagnan.”	426.51230491957665
“Go to bed, mademoiselle,” said Milady; “I don’t like comments.”	367.4397849167346
D’Artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which	397.73920059927354
Milady fastened herself in. On her side, but as softly as possible,	391.43382555549067
Kitty turned the key of the lock, and then D’Artagnan opened the closet	469.3645150162846
door.	479.4023447209738
“Oh, good Lord!” said Kitty, in a low voice, “what is the matter with	474.7039914928072
you? How pale you are!”	364.49373363484017
“The abominable creature,” murmured D’Artagnan.	316.54736455968265
“Silence, silence, begone!” said Kitty. “There is nothing but a	364.8053361724938
wainscot between my chamber and Milady’s; every word that is uttered in	438.7808905351337
one can be heard in the other.”	386.69879539590045
“That’s exactly the reason I won’t go,” said D’Artagnan.	424.13262543831814
“What!” said Kitty, blushing.	429.1100814941013
“Or, at least, I will go—later.”	488.2650450056527
He drew Kitty to him. She had the less motive to resist, resistance	465.2187769339903
would make so much noise. Therefore Kitty surrendered.	481.47440111490016
It was a movement of vengeance upon Milady. D’Artagnan believed it	443.69398445885565
right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. With a little	398.53187619112117
more heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but	412.0815104221814
the principal features of his character were ambition and pride. It	402.53765812530366
must, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he	469.1363333522429
made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had	420.23665514651435
become of Mme. Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to	484.18878969042464
D’Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress	460.52672418002214
never admitting her into half her secrets—only she believed she could	372.7655662385827
say she was not dead.	447.06136567377837
As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the	407.1247102301505
cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time D’Artagnan was	393.2799123110169
better informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel	424.6721438743298
at the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost	383.0433725612387
without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.	398.8386846585752
But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the	475.16737100937263
profound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his	384.3899212358503
not having killed her brother-in-law.	398.91137123473976
D’Artagnan came the next day to Milady’s, and finding her in a very	475.17156259582964
ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes	459.7439319280529
that provoked her thus. Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with	336.51595706695394
her. The poor girl ventured a glance at D’Artagnan which said, “See how	298.58763557080374
I suffer on your account!”	430.7309340007883
Toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became	351.1477228813252
milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of D’Artagnan, and	456.4559786481708
even gave him her hand to kiss.	464.99416171792063
D’Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a	410.0441514651909
youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his	349.69789860738825
court to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind.	453.2668333035796
He found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up	327.4614549438242
to her chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely	452.9265879858878
scolded. Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de	435.83146367151636
Wardes, and she ordered Kitty to come at nine o’clock in the morning to	338.3341607601485
take a third letter.	413.49392349688935
D’Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following	352.6788313219564
morning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.	489.71264511376876
Things passed as on the night before. D’Artagnan concealed himself in	389.49105554179204
his closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the	306.2856251193665
door. As the night before, D’Artagnan did not return home till five	383.1707177445501
o’clock in the morning.	294.405719929478
At eleven o’clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh	294.2179739258584
billet from Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with	303.51820192379523
D’Artagnan; she gave it to him at once. She belonged body and soul to	304.03488923528425
her handsome soldier.	479.9187385668298
D’Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:	391.19778636035903
This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love	453.57891503994404
you. Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I	396.66274213537656
detest you.	475.54021336147343
    If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the	331.9233038180622
    young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit	461.3556220322715
    may obtain his pardon.	365.30051624154135
D’Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.	455.3928894661981
“Oh, you love her still,” said Kitty, who had not taken her eyes off	351.1255268216706
the young man’s countenance for an instant.	487.67371937126734
“No, Kitty, you are mistaken. I do not love her, but I will avenge	348.98434284226073
myself for her contempt.”	329.78990957538116
“Oh, yes, I know what sort of vengeance! You told me that!”	397.99816419148823
“What matters it to you, Kitty? You know it is you alone whom I love.”	376.98282279121025
“How can I know that?”	315.0310012972853
“By the scorn I will throw upon her.”	441.96359564789765
D’Artagnan took a pen and wrote:	428.9476459125656
MADAME, Until the present moment I could not believe that it was to me	348.23341052991293
your first two letters were addressed, so unworthy did I feel myself of	416.91511345711695
such an honor; besides, I was so seriously indisposed that I could not	416.55660647730787
in any case have replied to them.	352.29059172054735
    But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness,	415.35851243929426
    since not only your letter but your servant assures me that I have	475.11943056839306
    the good fortune to be beloved by you.	399.01555205291
    She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit	379.7980109652399
    may obtain his pardon. I will come and ask mine at eleven o’clock	298.3677867008679
    this evening.	432.908819903652
    To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh	469.9665272594075
    offense.	460.20627085183
    From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men,	468.9173175259758
COMTE DE WARDES	313.8190408883685
This note was in the first place a forgery; it was likewise an	415.76621025595136
indelicacy. It was even, according to our present manners, something	373.9292131032764
like an infamous action; but at that period people did not manage	449.50288071494026
affairs as they do today. Besides, D’Artagnan from her own admission	308.7548824156696
knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could	308.16226431647056
entertain no respect for her. And yet, notwithstanding this want of	313.15203810972025
respect, he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in	387.54705150792347
his veins—passion drunk with contempt; but passion or thirst, as the	427.46752647131154
reader pleases.	386.841844809705
D’Artagnan’s plan was very simple. By Kitty’s chamber he could gain	416.9155239672816
that of her mistress. He would take advantage of the first moment of	415.5845433447176
surprise, shame, and terror, to triumph over her. He might fail, but	358.9483190968888
something must be left to chance. In eight days the campaign would	365.6302094023483
open, and he would be compelled to leave Paris; D’Artagnan had no time	333.2277538277366
for a prolonged love siege.	360.46911897473325
“There,” said the young man, handing Kitty the letter sealed; “give	438.69668738678575
that to Milady. It is the count’s reply.”	320.35787714826876
Poor Kitty became as pale as death; she suspected what the letter	329.3513377911044
contained.	481.3045345227751
“Listen, my dear girl,” said D’Artagnan; “you cannot but perceive that	310.287903011447
all this must end, some way or other. Milady may discover that you gave	311.852765028726
the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count’s; that it is I	410.48542982284073
who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de	383.4883751153197
Wardes. Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not	408.56332364322077
the woman to limit her vengeance.”	457.70471092338073
“Alas!” said Kitty, “for whom have I exposed myself to all that?”	367.92299160196904
“For me, I well know, my sweet girl,” said D’Artagnan. “But I am	442.0409322962956
grateful, I swear to you.”	472.29644688315653
“But what does this note contain?”	382.76910260681024
“Milady will tell you.”	375.75292712541443
“Ah, you do not love me!” cried Kitty, “and I am very wretched.”	434.78019146830763
To this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.	418.0197611902926
D’Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great	407.12647427791956
delusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the	410.1566304877704
letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all	366.3297283523948
D’Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her	432.0259554338329
mistress’s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he	380.1419055992608
left the mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed	471.3892218106874
poor Kitty’s consolation.	314.48542824429234
Chapter XXXIV.	432.98271153777176
IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF	301.5822237565095
Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there	426.7842883708147
had been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one	388.4068944581352
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.	429.12808560270196
Duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which	303.19003254537114
was gliding away so rapidly—only they had agreed to meet once a week,	426.86703570189445
about one o’clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in	432.83808704517685
agreement with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold	404.17036289645216
of his door.	409.3916289068645
This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to	329.9886947417184
find D’Artagnan. Soon as Kitty left him, D’Artagnan directed his steps	453.4793803680245
toward the Rue Férou.	328.04172582459967
He found Athos and Aramis philosophizing. Aramis had some slight	461.4089047960174
inclination to resume the cassock. Athos, according to his system,	365.228276559441
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. Athos believed that everyone	319.420426113286
should be left to his own free will. He never gave advice but when it	333.7644503833299
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.	465.14329795505233
“People, in general,” he said, “only ask advice not to follow it; or if	331.8494431311769
they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for	450.47601215127503
having given it.”	427.2430581778433
Porthos arrived a minute after D’Artagnan. The four friends were	432.82633055865534
reunited.	431.97324477879636
The four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of	460.94668337582186
Porthos, tranquillity; that of D’Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis,	393.90660926054994
uneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness.	296.93046089647595
At the end of a moment’s conversation, in which Porthos hinted that a	431.03096811676005
lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his	377.9267086605737
embarrassment, Mousqueton entered. He came to request his master to	299.56560803150757
return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously	328.2025886598017
said.	391.62624938430685
“Is it my equipment?”	305.72322526998244
“Yes and no,” replied Mousqueton.	411.54466938251244
“Well, but can’t you speak?”	433.1633128061104
“Come, monsieur.”	467.15301602725526
Porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton. An instant	438.5329774939555
after, Bazin made his appearance at the door.	426.47222713954375
“What do you want with me, my friend?” said Aramis, with that mildness	349.0367753314848
of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were	393.4820357867409
directed toward the Church.	403.56450234239753
“A man wishes to see Monsieur at home,” replied Bazin.	338.0699810799561
“A man! What man?”	362.3091661074826
“A mendicant.”	490.6530384088366
“Give him alms, Bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner.”	353.17584142186985
“This mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you	405.8802401117365
will be very glad to see him.”	319.63896058741454
“Has he sent no particular message for me?”	356.2799150064118
“Yes. If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come,” he said, “tell him I am	312.9316466986727
from Tours.”	407.7130549456596
“From Tours!” cried Aramis. “A thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no	491.80007084514205
doubt this man brings me the news I expected.” And rising also, he went	426.80227079973247
off at a quick pace. There remained Athos and D’Artagnan.	395.6675749190892
“I believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you	333.346550823858
think, D’Artagnan?” said Athos.	359.6058170230256
“I know that Porthos was in a fair way,” replied D’Artagnan; “and as to	480.2344300012745
Aramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his	326.3554003564333
account. But you, my dear Athos—you, who so generously distributed the	330.5007117203267
Englishman’s pistoles, which were our legitimate property—what do you	424.9967401208283
mean to do?”	457.61732966995066
“I am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it	374.12103297038783
is blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his	443.63693807587134
pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.”	324.43692133457546
“Go to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.”	437.63042361541824
“Let it pass. What do you think of Monsieur de Tréville telling me,	355.72985804574876
when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated	452.16818533124183
with the suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?”	351.386436867692
“That is to say, I visit an Englishwoman—the one I named.”	474.6764931808947
“Oh, ay! the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice, which	418.90228992242726
naturally you took care not to adopt.”	413.60952892146
“I gave you my reasons.”	461.20959221513095
“Yes; you look there for your outfit, I think you said.”	440.59571516378924
“Not at all. I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was	368.95891392150384
concerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacieux.”	425.22601159841867
“Yes, I understand now: to find one woman, you court another. It is the	356.26378957744265
longest road, but certainly the most amusing.”	416.71580828340757
D’Artagnan was on the point of telling Athos all; but one consideration	444.56987825508094
restrained him. Athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;	443.6651602735172
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady, he	402.0145487457031
was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this	387.8374291553167
Puritan. He was therefore silent; and as Athos was the least	331.6523431409693
inquisitive of any man on earth, D’Artagnan’s confidence stopped there.	341.7315614073997
We will therefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to	409.05241637156803
say to each other, and follow Aramis.	342.43312573257197
Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came	451.6389739492105
from Tours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or	376.9207691863378
rather went before, Bazin; he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou	394.89830203488486
to the Rue de Vaugirard. On entering he found a man of short stature	449.04251711689943
and intelligent eyes, but covered with rags.	487.5077678992663
“You have asked for me?” said the Musketeer.	404.7296349994328
“I wish to speak with Monsieur Aramis. Is that your name, monsieur?”	405.7489548054761
“My very own. You have brought me something?”	410.64971003683365
“Yes, if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief.”	438.8653835222094
“Here it is,” said Aramis, taking a small key from his breast and	356.58147372441465
opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl, “here it is.	401.02119940764635
Look.”	334.8123749535327
“That is right,” replied the mendicant; “dismiss your lackey.”	292.8068277223825
In fact, Bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his	304.4066666761174
master, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at	314.2428688075154
the same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him. At	451.6367019994317
the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and	456.4230893523752
he was obliged to obey.	398.7008578262499
Bazin gone, the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be	379.8395832412184
sure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged	491.70410326914237
vest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper	353.6138516565397
part of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.	379.64393635495634
Aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the	308.85264859471147
superscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the	325.58619361390674
epistle, which contained what follows:	345.1981762743833
“My Friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some	400.6105947396911
time separated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond	377.6080875726924
return. Perform your duty in camp; I will do mine elsewhere. Accept	406.0311618343885
that which the bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome	307.5052800360979
true gentleman, and think of me, who kisses tenderly your black eyes.	436.5923440098194
    “Adieu; or rather, _au revoir_.”	363.19257820899963
The mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his	311.23485203151415
rags a hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on	436.42167096339324
the table; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the	351.8913179017829
young man, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to	384.0672201502006
him.	333.0746253937184
Aramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript:	301.88017832381087
PS. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee	325.10654591638513
of Spain!	361.43835295342893
“Golden dreams!” cried Aramis. “Oh, beautiful life! Yes, we are young;	327.16133736131457
yes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all,	431.21401177285895
all, all, are thine, my adored mistress!”	404.93714582268973
And he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look	363.3663952949622
at the gold which sparkled on the table.	340.34198625075317
Bazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to	324.8736882400277
exclude him, he bade him come in.	424.85641589399046
Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came	358.6498920730369
to announce D’Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could	441.09363467659716
be, came to Aramis on leaving Athos.	483.57452636865855
Now, as D’Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin	377.83844780911664
forgot to announce him, he announced himself.	347.08574962370545
“The devil! my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, “if these are the prunes	376.6322208727646
that are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to	389.5792147995918
the gardener who gathers them.”	479.2754781888143
“You are mistaken, friend D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, always on his	491.809761035111
guard; “this is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of	318.14452312455677
that poem in one-syllable verse which I began yonder.”	476.1820524148518
“Ah, indeed,” said D’Artagnan. “Well, your publisher is very generous,	459.3914706730986
my dear Aramis, that’s all I can say.”	418.27593795240824
“How, monsieur?” cried Bazin, “a poem sell so dear as that! It is	390.3082056852229
incredible! Oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may	460.3216496234793
become equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benserade. I like	384.8914267800994
that. A poet is as good as an abbé. Ah! Monsieur Aramis, become a poet,	446.80012152378674
I beg of you.”	441.0476590680116
“Bazin, my friend,” said Aramis, “I believe you meddle with my	301.9472804165795
conversation.”	359.1357181200628
Bazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.	404.6096986978529
“Ah!” said D’Artagnan with a smile, “you sell your productions at their	334.6658869146555
weight in gold. You are very fortunate, my friend; but take care or you	388.96023922954134
will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which	482.6778935956305
also comes, no doubt, from your publisher.”	439.8383550861256
Aramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his	455.2954696369778
doublet.	394.14205967483935
“My dear D’Artagnan,” said he, “if you please, we will join our	403.5107829853487
friends; as I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again,	330.61838352471307
expecting that you will be rich in your turn.”	363.18395142277365
“My faith!” said D’Artagnan, with great pleasure. “It is long since we	415.16092380179276
have had a good dinner; and I, for my part, have a somewhat hazardous	434.9454172181732
expedition for this evening, and shall not be sorry, I confess, to	380.2177938870801
fortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burgundy.”	447.0976685570944
“Agreed, as to the old Burgundy; I have no objection to that,” said	408.35430512958345
Aramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his	445.43448340676537
ideas of conversion.	461.28475481515807
And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer	425.7359376379263
the needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid	413.9616147305605
with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served	452.8565974801827
him as a talisman.	403.8222132493865
The two friends repaired to Athos’s, and he, faithful to his vow of not	477.66829118728515
going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. As he	326.7039134079891
was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, D’Artagnan and	453.03732783788496
Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.	410.045760766726
They went to find Porthos, and at the corner of the Rue Bac met	469.00088842410537
Mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a	480.2584319334502
mule and a horse.	325.41525127316146
D’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from	314.77098952381584
joy.	434.9359251274332
“Ah, my yellow horse,” cried he. “Aramis, look at that horse!”	461.847340467319
“Oh, the frightful brute!” said Aramis.	304.98594734044286
“Ah, my dear,” replied D’Artagnan, “upon that very horse I came to	361.66361599353166
Paris.”	324.25097008367413
“What, does Monsieur know this horse?” said Mousqueton.	491.7560866765926
“It is of an original color,” said Aramis; “I never saw one with such a	460.4638486604224
hide in my life.”	456.3152441993796
“I can well believe it,” replied D’Artagnan, “and that was why I got	368.03628506975394
three crowns for him. It must have been for his hide, for, _certes_,	433.9885491350998
the carcass is not worth eighteen livres. But how did this horse come	365.2888660362899
into your hands, Mousqueton?”	452.098209069508
“Pray,” said the lackey, “say nothing about it, monsieur; it is a	345.81522204380144
frightful trick of the husband of our duchess!”	320.2485525659356
“How is that, Mousqueton?”	456.4622092274112
“Why, we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of	360.85903593953947
quality, the Duchesse de—but, your pardon; my master has commanded me	338.0805786336494
to be discreet. She had forced us to accept a little souvenir, a	312.0277661497589
magnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule, which were	344.2796536424744
beautiful to look upon. The husband heard of the affair; on their way	410.39963137694565
he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us,	348.7198911945717
and substituted these horrible animals.”	405.50522630718785
“Which you are taking back to him?” said D’Artagnan.	460.06405008291824
“Exactly!” replied Mousqueton. “You may well believe that we will not	455.5315739833195
accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been	365.8900242269332
promised to us.”	365.2867848922599
“No, _pardieu;_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow	294.43168065490374
horse. That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in	293.19568967658734
Paris. But don’t let us hinder you, Mousqueton; go and perform your	364.86532146770026
master’s orders. Is he at home?”	339.19237411916055
“Yes, monsieur,” said Mousqueton, “but in a very ill humor. Get up!”	390.79384376194747
He continued his way toward the Quai des Grands Augustins, while the	448.73919996803
two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate Porthos. He,	360.4723026528943
having seen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they	338.8672745227309
rang in vain.	329.57353749997543
Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way, and crossing the Pont Neuf,	471.1368876412431
still driving the two sorry animals before him, he reached the Rue aux	310.5404939481344
Ours. Arrived there, he fastened, according to the orders of his	332.17935024278154
master, both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator’s door;	312.1330048211249
then, without taking any thought for their future, he returned to	406.74709962492784
Porthos, and told him that his commission was completed.	467.3309163030924
In a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything	402.4795159665361
since the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the	441.18108793001784
knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in	306.54089912297746
the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.	431.09758069230264
Mme. Coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first	437.3173634100718
comprehend this restitution; but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened	343.3862108978359
her. The anger which fired the eyes of the Musketeer, in spite of his	472.31724528263203
efforts to suppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. In fact,	415.87422732920385
Mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met D’Artagnan	473.58173522015795
and Aramis, and that D’Artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the	453.93228075294707
Béarnese pony upon which he had come to Paris, and which he had sold	320.8985579264862
for three crowns.	421.1445970788793
Porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the	306.78136494299395
procurator’s wife in the cloister of St. Magloire. The procurator,	372.50928288762606
seeing he was going, invited him to dinner—an invitation which the	306.17740321123335
Musketeer refused with a majestic air.	394.5934665617439
Mme. Coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of St. Magloire, for	466.1841243477294
she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was	412.2981171027948
fascinated by the lofty airs of Porthos.	454.50289102434186
All that which a man wounded in his self-love could let fall in the	380.14362640412116
shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman Porthos	378.29924635992063
let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator’s wife.	334.8817538589433
“Alas,” said she, “I did all for the best! One of our clients is a	363.96347105705246
horsedealer; he owes money to the office, and is backward in his pay. I	307.3564752439508
took the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that	428.57155104303683
they were two noble steeds.”	347.0019218991862
“Well, madame,” said Porthos, “if he owed you more than five crowns,	453.04668343834373
your horsedealer is a thief.”	387.68261582253547
“There is no harm in trying to buy things cheap, Monsieur Porthos,”	333.40859899995473
said the procurator’s wife, seeking to excuse herself.	395.82293244023526
“No, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought	343.73130655454236
to permit others to seek more generous friends.” And Porthos, turning	423.80565134146474
on his heel, made a step to retire.	404.002378358579
“Monsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!” cried the procurator’s wife. “I	419.0054326511852
have been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it	312.37719867944327
was to equip a cavalier like you.”	491.78537326668356
Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator’s wife	370.946003929684
fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses	487.0215033236136
and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet.	464.24915974183784
“Stop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!” cried she. “Stop, and	484.84233154205555
let us talk.”	380.2443766829733
“Talking with you brings me misfortune,” said Porthos.	339.1027515673551
“But, tell me, what do you ask?”	347.0588804615488
“Nothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for	488.9781688014006
something.”	464.02727435164906
The procurator’s wife hung upon the arm of Porthos, and in the violence	472.56700924112397
of her grief she cried out, “Monsieur Porthos, I am ignorant of all	387.5032996363177
such matters! How should I know what a horse is? How should I know what	378.98447618074067
horse furniture is?”	378.63405607675327
“You should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are;	480.58706878932065
but you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.”	434.3678926831509
“It was wrong, Monsieur Porthos; but I will repair that wrong, upon my	466.5271467613629
word of honor.”	305.7204852962617
“How so?” asked the Musketeer.	468.3188228931354
“Listen. This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Duc de	402.46857799701814
Chaulnes, who has sent for him. It is for a consultation, which will	320.96762449291174
last three hours at least. Come! We shall be alone, and can make up our	356.5642037341212
accounts.”	431.68654999067456
“In good time. Now you talk, my dear.”	443.7792804048758
“You pardon me?”	397.871585045953
“We shall see,” said Porthos, majestically; and the two separated	411.5353591193374
saying, “Till this evening.”	398.5750211243657
“The devil!” thought Porthos, as he walked away, “it appears I am	427.0767106229399
getting nearer to Monsieur Coquenard’s strongbox at last.”	403.25711435989643
Chapter XXXV.	455.881801591778
A GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID	376.19131704992395
The evening so impatiently waited for by Porthos and by D’Artagnan at	372.4474375344422
last arrived.	487.5581089129522
As was his custom, D’Artagnan presented himself at Milady’s at about	457.65559354001834
nine o’clock. He found her in a charming humor. Never had he been so	310.7353523891655
well received. Our Gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that	318.5215287612405
his billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.	379.78066584585645
Kitty entered to bring some sherbet. Her mistress put on a charming	389.736818885369
face, and smiled on her graciously; but alas! the poor girl was so sad	379.8691125044478
that she did not even notice Milady’s condescension.	338.8143836006232
D’Artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced	434.4019451493002
to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in	457.93310337993626
their formation. To the great lady she had given a heart vile and	341.44214844889206
venal; to the _soubrette_ she had given the heart of a duchess.	488.88699254324865
At ten o’clock Milady began to appear restless. D’Artagnan knew what	461.0843864284245
she wanted. She looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at	339.19398435663504
D’Artagnan with an air which said, “You are very amiable, no doubt, but	375.4521056903849
you would be _charming_ if you would only depart.”	343.0902932514059
D’Artagnan rose and took his hat; Milady gave him her hand to kiss. The	391.8692540191154
young man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a	474.11378672648124
sentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.	382.5149067808027
“She loves him devilishly,” he murmured. Then he went out.	308.6926648378747
This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the	324.5917557897874
antechamber, nor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door. It was	411.22124133537665
necessary that D’Artagnan should find alone the staircase and the	486.2843258291242
little chamber. She heard him enter, but she did not raise her head.	305.2427508842157
The young man went to her and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.	411.0183928032304
As D’Artagnan had presumed, on receiving his letter, Milady in a	306.89498839292264
delirium of joy had told her servant everything; and by way of	318.0820949584349
recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the	468.39273240053706
commission, she had given Kitty a purse.	454.1363750320655
Returning to her own room, Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner,	448.58917390702163
where it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.	468.23304457816187
The poor girl, under the caresses of D’Artagnan, lifted her head.	429.02724380084726
D’Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance. She	376.7123759511487
joined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a	386.5689414497086
word. As little sensitive as was the heart of D’Artagnan, he was	469.4421264252245
touched by this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his	361.8453109484667
projects, above all to this one, to change the program which he had	302.4329389621369
laid out in advance. He did not therefore allow her any hope that he	345.3279610827984
would flinch; only he represented his action as one of simple	334.2452676490706
vengeance.	349.34802455455235
For the rest this vengeance was very easy; for Milady, doubtless to	389.1987725846696
conceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered Kitty to extinguish all	307.17841468502365
the lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber itself.	368.94804455358184
Before daybreak M. de Wardes must take his departure, still in	337.6029750639403
obscurity.	313.61239430412496
Presently they heard Milady retire to her room. D’Artagnan slipped into	394.5366090995364
the wardrobe. Hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded.	455.7147807723186
Kitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the	450.9233628937051
partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed	474.61591293596524
between the two women.	480.74560096793414
Milady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest	325.0776073410479
details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes	399.27341638643804
when he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the	376.7077294080726
expression of his face; if he seemed very amorous. And to all these	455.93329171271546
questions poor Kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a	349.4511316606741
stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however	344.312012370139
remark, solely because happiness is egotistical.	310.2190730756601
Finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached,	478.10701338439935
Milady had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return	453.9073366707935
to her own chamber, and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented	377.66099019743046
himself.	419.7780862595612
Kitty’s detention was not long. Hardly had D’Artagnan seen, through a	384.1683186049589
crevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity, than	435.41187447614914
he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty	436.36816276567254
reclosed the door of communication.	360.885950360942
“What is that noise?” demanded Milady.	333.40236805701886
“It is I,” said D’Artagnan in a subdued voice, “I, the Comte de	468.1214182491108
Wardes.”	416.7759233704154
“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured Kitty, “he has not even waited for the	386.9582432657517
hour he himself named!”	470.6361928892303
“Well,” said Milady, in a trembling voice, “why do you not enter?	329.59642432370117
Count, Count,” added she, “you know that I wait for you.”	341.74856130666876
At this appeal D’Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the	361.733162395279
chamber.	364.1718908781499
If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives	354.149740830075
under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to	325.5962910638741
his happy rival. D’Artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had	336.93164091131825
not foreseen. Jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much	417.3367511575908
as poor Kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.	352.09972138747514
“Yes, Count,” said Milady, in her softest voice, and pressing his hand	295.1791768814314
in her own, “I am happy in the love which your looks and your words	425.9958365979237
have expressed to me every time we have met. I also—I love you. Oh,	461.29753290367034
tomorrow, tomorrow, I must have some pledge from you which will prove	335.68154539062385
that you think of me; and that you may not forget me, take this!” and	475.27491523989477
she slipped a ring from her finger onto D’Artagnan’s. D’Artagnan	416.1743092165352
remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady; it was a	327.51543631844277
magnificent sapphire, encircled with brilliants.	422.58922467900175
The first movement of D’Artagnan was to return it, but Milady added,	347.2035924760937
“No, no! Keep that ring for love of me. Besides, in accepting it,” she	354.91037646998336
added, in a voice full of emotion, “you render me a much greater	421.67869973392396
service than you imagine.”	397.2772607584778
“This woman is full of mysteries,” murmured D’Artagnan to himself. At	419.420139275712
that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all. He even opened his	382.5804998783541
mouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he	372.32626383663967
had come; but she added, “Poor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon	375.8701175384799
barely failed to kill.”	459.6510777160371
The monster was himself.	295.8647182741321
“Oh,” continued Milady, “do your wounds still make you suffer?”	477.28126357547904
“Yes, much,” said D’Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer.	456.715669395247
“Be tranquil,” murmured Milady; “I will avenge you—and cruelly!”	400.3818361961952
“_Peste!_” said D’Artagnan to himself, “the moment for confidences has	487.67477694326885
not yet come.”	455.1687081311062
It took some time for D’Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but	349.01491540959387
then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had	456.86721094646356
completely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable	400.5481338420788
power; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have	475.90214208393127
believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart,	426.2238752027065
and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were,	360.28947338087886
diabolical.	483.7295804216785
Presently it sounded one o’clock. It was necessary to separate.	437.65695934915635
D’Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest	334.9489136823935
regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a	436.9343351436379
reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the	341.12224252305236
following week.	381.1489025116324
Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to D’Artagnan when he passed	399.09996193875276
through her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the	295.61344539813814
darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.	415.78554936611323
The next morning D’Artagnan ran to find Athos. He was engaged in an	483.27954413029886
adventure so singular that he wished for counsel. He therefore told him	316.77448537517586
all.	473.70616651064347
“Your Milady,” said he, “appears to be an infamous creature, but not	427.57361382473357
the less you have done wrong to deceive her. In one fashion or another	372.8608488580046
you have a terrible enemy on your hands.”	347.16335397816175
While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with	415.78002172056364
diamonds which had taken, on D’Artagnan’s finger, the place of the	351.4169100316052
queen’s ring, carefully kept in a casket.	482.8999659977419
“You notice my ring?” said the Gascon, proud to display so rich a gift	427.78584388333525
in the eyes of his friends.	312.3041111305019
“Yes,” said Athos, “it reminds me of a family jewel.”	425.4001715809144
“It is beautiful, is it not?” said D’Artagnan.	314.1903986867878
“Yes,” said Athos, “magnificent. I did not think two sapphires of such	341.5532076087696
a fine water existed. Have you traded it for your diamond?”	329.9405802007989
“No. It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman, or rather	452.06960268402077
Frenchwoman—for I am convinced she was born in France, though I have	455.38731774121845
not questioned her.”	369.2499530052253
“That ring comes from Milady?” cried Athos, with a voice in which it	463.86099187964925
was easy to detect strong emotion.	362.40071209409
“Her very self; she gave it me last night. Here it is,” replied	330.5296317233057
D’Artagnan, taking it from his finger.	339.89625362450005
Athos examined it and became very pale. He tried it on his left hand;	485.84942129022244
it fit his finger as if made for it.	433.6148985157402
A shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of	439.6115904436113
this gentleman.	485.34914021112934
“It is impossible it can be she,” said he. “How could this ring come	479.22576223298535
into the hands of Milady Clarik? And yet it is difficult to suppose	311.72074825473
such a resemblance should exist between two jewels.”	416.9314406636664
“Do you know this ring?” said D’Artagnan.	345.4960148992456
“I thought I did,” replied Athos; “but no doubt I was mistaken.” And he	450.50140631745046
returned D’Artagnan the ring without, however, ceasing to look at it.	480.5176008250643
“Pray, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, after a minute, “either take off that	323.4409908768343
ring or turn the mounting inside; it recalls such cruel recollections	388.4984641571229
that I shall have no head to converse with you. Don’t ask me for	346.13937617057155
counsel; don’t tell me you are perplexed what to do. But stop! let me	440.0069822610661
look at that sapphire again; the one I mentioned to you had one of its	413.46993401635046
faces scratched by accident.”	456.4734269801545
D’Artagnan took off the ring, giving it again to Athos.	433.99688510779424
Athos started. “Look,” said he, “is it not strange?” and he pointed out	377.66099679201443
to D’Artagnan the scratch he had remembered.	484.06853056295085
“But from whom did this ring come to you, Athos?”	455.6869925885554
“From my mother, who inherited it from her mother. As I told you, it is	414.1852260330974
an old family jewel.”	380.1663711060967
“And you—sold it?” asked D’Artagnan, hesitatingly.	346.11328751910537
“No,” replied Athos, with a singular smile. “I gave it away in a night	357.53939705629136
of love, as it has been given to you.”	476.8180833030454
D’Artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were	432.00001796351137
abysses in Milady’s soul whose depths were dark and unknown. He took	411.97662141096055
back the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger.	303.4988795336297
“D’Artagnan,” said Athos, taking his hand, “you know I love you; if I	333.2515834323133
had a son I could not love him better. Take my advice, renounce this	354.0421492630775
woman. I do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she is a	301.17699043854003
lost creature, and that there is something fatal about her.”	459.62835870751644
“You are right,” said D’Artagnan; “I will have done with her. I own	456.8653408087558
that this woman terrifies me.”	300.2263573589257
“Shall you have the courage?” said Athos.	354.21389440000615
“I shall,” replied D’Artagnan, “and instantly.”	303.87138769929163
“In truth, my young friend, you will act rightly,” said the gentleman,	429.1689950105071
pressing the Gascon’s hand with an affection almost paternal; “and God	301.67668360824774
grant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not	468.21182726956874
leave a terrible trace in it!” And Athos bowed to D’Artagnan like a man	339.5291553914352
who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone	457.95915653444933
with his thoughts.	448.28729979672596
On reaching home D’Artagnan found Kitty waiting for him. A month of	428.0557490864578
fever could not have changed her more than this one night of	315.31531070516763
sleeplessness and sorrow.	402.60636368566986
She was sent by her mistress to the false De Wardes. Her mistress was	384.9050957870693
mad with love, intoxicated with joy. She wished to know when her lover	352.8694634004332
would meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling,	402.72177835155685
awaited D’Artagnan’s reply. The counsels of his friend, joined to the	412.6068119338637
cries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and	456.9992481961359
his vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again. As a reply, he wrote	460.57150877264394
the following letter:	490.0740822410593
Do not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting. Since my	449.9780340314687
convalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am	337.7650180842657
forced to regulate them a little. When your turn comes, I shall have	412.81762746318816
the honor to inform you of it. I kiss your hands.	477.59415462340377
COMTE DE WARDES	461.91405648039876
Not a word about the sapphire. Was the Gascon determined to keep it as	479.2709811584109
a weapon against Milady, or else, let us be frank, did he not reserve	332.57340890661675
the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit? It would be wrong to	370.14632706900665
judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another. That	347.27250607323055
which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that	330.0853091938451
time quite a simple and natural affair, and the younger sons of the	347.4182623261041
best families were frequently supported by their mistresses. D’Artagnan	404.8020478345669
gave the open letter to Kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend	395.2325926632344
it, but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time.	292.28029034425924
She could scarcely believe in her happiness; and D’Artagnan was forced	433.02358067859683
to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written. And	423.56440799308825
whatever might be—considering the violent character of Milady—the	361.9481825145733
danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her	444.42908262123865
mistress, she ran back to the Place Royale as fast as her legs could	469.89052623244606
carry her.	425.2008237596931
The heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival.	313.74146474976015
Milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to Kitty’s in bringing	298.96986878306956
it; but at the first words she read she became livid. She crushed the	318.15416468559056
paper in her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon Kitty, she	376.0859182665921
cried, “What is this letter?”	429.7848097299822
“The answer to Madame’s,” replied Kitty, all in a tremble.	475.63757399784333
“Impossible!” cried Milady. “It is impossible a gentleman could have	474.3527733284049
written such a letter to a woman.” Then all at once, starting, she	425.0208049790548
cried, “My God! can he have—” and she stopped. She ground her teeth;	380.5692855510571
she was of the color of ashes. She tried to go toward the window for	361.8888573664281
air, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her,	394.5209299085623
and she sank into an armchair. Kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened	384.0216991172524
toward her and was beginning to open her dress; but Milady started up,	428.3651705939046
pushing her away. “What do you want with me?” said she, “and why do you	482.33368757605774
place your hand on me?”	408.8861171688278
“I thought that Madame was ill, and I wished to bring her help,”	472.5300121793242
responded the maid, frightened at the terrible expression which had	407.70115580225115
come over her mistress’s face.	447.3257410264158
“I faint? I? I? Do you take me for half a woman? When I am insulted I	309.5869745472809
do not faint; I avenge myself!”	482.70762562093563
And she made a sign for Kitty to leave the room.	428.78898408200484
Chapter XXXVI.	450.65246349884933
DREAM OF VENGEANCE	341.7251468691696
That evening Milady gave orders that when M. d’Artagnan came as usual,	461.46520990384784
he should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.	369.70988537757904
The next day Kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him	375.52680006541465
all that had passed on the preceding evening. D’Artagnan smiled; this	300.7253142740484
jealous anger of Milady was his revenge.	326.8221605692538
That evening Milady was still more impatient than on the preceding	325.4843987204796
evening. She renewed the order relative to the Gascon; but as before	309.9244617684247
she expected him in vain.	389.7863437263577
The next morning, when Kitty presented herself at D’Artagnan’s, she was	482.1709038965755
no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the	330.1647260937542
contrary sad as death.	470.66189938325374
D’Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she,	484.91343556644665
as her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.	295.96034942809916
This letter was in Milady’s handwriting; only this time it was	487.3625584457266
addressed to M. d’Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.	394.38523430045547
He opened it and read as follows:	322.26970575200374
DEAR M. D’ARTAGNAN, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends,	375.2090447073606
particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a	354.50573896370344
time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day	387.86724432061555
before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening?	458.8018882930985
Your very grateful,	417.34306372627526
MILADY CLARIK	421.21962799594223
“That’s all very simple,” said D’Artagnan; “I expected this letter. My	392.4699439200115
credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.”	444.4003419693846
“And will you go?” asked Kitty.	329.10933675082504
“Listen to me, my dear girl,” said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse	307.8453589537231
in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; “you must	406.1386279254252
understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive	482.134478863423
invitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to	410.04754402334737
understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might	442.6171850856758
suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman	362.8949491012902
would go?”	385.42524090259667
“Oh, my God!” said Kitty, “you know how to represent things in such a	462.7752732697162
way that you are always in the right. You are going now to pay your	353.2261484179803
court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in	438.07197733405945
your own name and with your own face, it will be much worse than	376.7103708965495
before.”	366.435270012928
Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen. D’Artagnan	385.37685339221605
reassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to	314.39770531623344
the seductions of Milady.	345.84341158754194
He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more	347.4589460633291
grateful for her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient	450.5504954748915
to her orders. He did not dare to write for fear of not being able—to	296.7043098194255
such experienced eyes as those of Milady—to disguise his writing	390.21139916543825
sufficiently.	403.10426545315056
As nine o’clock sounded, D’Artagnan was at the Place Royale. It was	441.5557059404253
evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned,	440.987281415299
for as soon as D’Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady	393.4489797048316
were visible, one of them ran to announce him.	405.59165159401164
“Show him in,” said Milady, in a quick tone, but so piercing that	444.97611640099126
D’Artagnan heard her in the antechamber.	306.77969658299077
He was introduced.	388.9486727775583
“I am at home to nobody,” said Milady; “observe, to _nobody_.”	437.358040123751
The servant went out.	407.6520325548705
D’Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady. She was pale, and looked	368.53174288181447
fatigued, either from tears or want of sleep. The number of lights had	423.33933073042033
been intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal	490.9553099180737
the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days.	459.1328950206658
D’Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry. She then made an	333.6963828299606
extraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed	418.22187798460055
countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile.	374.15534273823937
To the questions which D’Artagnan put concerning her health, she	396.6568802123341
replied, “Bad, very bad.”	413.4332947541142
“Then,” replied he, “my visit is ill-timed; you, no doubt, stand in	475.9877879800722
need of repose, and I will withdraw.”	419.81398546779735
“No, no!” said Milady. “On the contrary, stay, Monsieur d’Artagnan;	462.70004602105666
your agreeable company will divert me.”	436.83904988397273
“Oh, oh!” thought D’Artagnan. “She has never been so kind before. On	438.0167516487308
guard!”	388.6195816182351
Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible, and conversed with more	356.80065103495974
than her usual brilliancy. At the same time the fever, which for an	385.06219856845513
instant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to	348.6139292829564
her cheeks, and vermillion to her lips. D’Artagnan was again in the	478.67770708894625
presence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her	308.5601902900297
enchantments. His love, which he believed to be extinct but which was	426.75016236369623
only asleep, awoke again in his heart. Milady smiled, and D’Artagnan	451.1470285536247
felt that he could damn himself for that smile. There was a moment at	393.3782138469869
which he felt something like remorse.	472.3689939001159
By degrees, Milady became more communicative. She asked D’Artagnan if	486.1952467619542
he had a mistress.	474.36703491973935
“Alas!” said D’Artagnan, with the most sentimental air he could assume,	294.8941634095981
“can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me—to me, who, from	480.18005569689086
the moment I saw you, have only breathed and sighed through you and for	357.0846609629538
you?”	443.8851278196451
Milady smiled with a strange smile.	487.9099772712086
“Then you love me?” said she.	445.8850871122677
“Have I any need to tell you so? Have you not perceived it?”	477.2235974801889
“It may be; but you know the more hearts are worth the capture, the	364.03917613851775
more difficult they are to be won.”	323.240145740128
“Oh, difficulties do not affright me,” said D’Artagnan. “I shrink	361.0305872629832
before nothing but impossibilities.”	317.4449028873023
“Nothing is impossible,” replied Milady, “to true love.”	412.97821233183066
“Nothing, madame?”	318.6142703812104
“Nothing,” replied Milady.	469.69847134740456
“The devil!” thought D’Artagnan. “The note is changed. Is she going to	404.2719142073196
fall in love with me, by chance, this fair inconstant; and will she be	483.6604331331713
disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me	352.8115150955682
for De Wardes?”	306.5555666378571
D’Artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to Milady’s.	361.74765358591657
“Well, now,” she said, “let us see what you would do to prove this love	314.8193429966803
of which you speak.”	472.1672167453096
“All that could be required of me. Order; I am ready.”	472.32970657663367
“For everything?”	300.27557454789786
“For everything,” cried D’Artagnan, who knew beforehand that he had not	455.6947552244193
much to risk in engaging himself thus.	473.1054259749643
“Well, now let us talk a little seriously,” said Milady, in her turn	449.1923371227759
drawing her armchair nearer to D’Artagnan’s chair.	489.1261723090016
“I am all attention, madame,” said he.	477.45321323803375
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment; then, as if	311.19630902182297
appearing to have formed a resolution, she said, “I have an enemy.”	347.9308414381427
“You, madame!” said D’Artagnan, affecting surprise; “is that possible,	467.0483908410072
my God?—good and beautiful as you are!”	345.05214325151576
“A mortal enemy.”	405.0189832047552
“Indeed!”	444.05465757270787
“An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is	359.1181760772623
war to the death. May I reckon on you as an auxiliary?”	338.8687711596034
D’Artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature	355.7182972993038
wished to reach.	307.48500746567294
“You may, madame,” said he, with emphasis. “My arm and my life belong	426.4689539271315
to you, like my love.”	295.95479322815436
“Then,” said Milady, “since you are as generous as you are loving—”	325.3608030434369
She stopped.	414.4407693685014
“Well?” demanded D’Artagnan.	374.6418006161841
“Well,” replied Milady, after a moment of silence, “from the present	487.38467390512534
time, cease to talk of impossibilities.”	411.12111094892333
“Do not overwhelm me with happiness,” cried D’Artagnan, throwing	321.0152014651559
himself on his knees, and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to	389.0586502953568
him.	401.56985596285017
“Avenge me of that infamous De Wardes,” said Milady, between her teeth,	309.13546453569654
“and I shall soon know how to get rid of you—you double idiot, you	479.58903596291145
animated sword blade!”	331.2926700676368
“Fall voluntarily into my arms, hypocritical and dangerous woman,” said	415.43922940238326
D’Artagnan, likewise to himself, “after having abused me with such	367.02094996082184
effrontery, and afterward I will laugh at you with him whom you wish me	382.69783190943576
to kill.”	318.57574500093364
D’Artagnan lifted up his head.	434.2705132422619
“I am ready,” said he.	449.1056640439706
“You have understood me, then, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Milady.	370.18555513916044
“I could interpret one of your looks.”	473.9310042569749
“Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so	407.24532256604084
much renown?”	347.81663715161824
“Instantly!”	389.1640043584411
“But on my part,” said Milady, “how should I repay such a service? I	310.7999227347969
know these lovers. They are men who do nothing for nothing.”	361.9831950889773
“You know the only reply that I desire,” said D’Artagnan, “the only one	470.0438351011925
worthy of you and of me!”	349.82230508651946
And he drew nearer to her.	367.4207757305645
She scarcely resisted.	489.725615743409
“Interested man!” cried she, smiling.	410.74050167446046
“Ah,” cried D’Artagnan, really carried away by the passion this woman	468.92036378443197
had the power to kindle in his heart, “ah, that is because my happiness	328.47024612108106
appears so impossible to me; and I have such fear that it should fly	438.05809554690234
away from me like a dream that I pant to make a reality of it.”	463.35594112427145
“Well, merit this pretended happiness, then!”	442.9069662739637
“I am at your orders,” said D’Artagnan.	324.4820618708414
“Quite certain?” said Milady, with a last doubt.	476.8130951963558
“Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your	373.1524244048917
beautiful eyes!”	488.66308320572347
“Who told you that I had been weeping?” said she.	331.41167026337394
“It appeared to me—”	386.84558327921496
“Such women as I never weep,” said Milady.	395.6009809542305
“So much the better! Come, tell me his name!”	346.27371424135896
“Remember that his name is all my secret.”	357.7814164470523
“Yet I must know his name.”	451.3762202990957
“Yes, you must; see what confidence I have in you!”	462.06809144128863
“You overwhelm me with joy. What is his name?”	428.8809117478355
“You know him.”	415.46953963871385
“Indeed.”	352.6963268910206
“Yes.”	349.3832614873334
“It is surely not one of my friends?” replied D’Artagnan, affecting	345.714809109723
hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant.	453.846334486556
“If it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?” cried	480.30860538387293
Milady; and a threatening glance darted from her eyes.	429.15825731721213
“Not if it were my own brother!” cried D’Artagnan, as if carried away	474.5747087270005
by his enthusiasm.	310.9220554016451
Our Gascon promised this without risk, for he knew all that was meant.	384.74056665214755
“I love your devotedness,” said Milady.	461.9953341901586
“Alas, do you love nothing else in me?” asked D’Artagnan.	477.9159743765815
“I love you also, _you!_” said she, taking his hand.	423.5806902847706
The warm pressure made D’Artagnan tremble, as if by the touch that	336.908214030197
fever which consumed Milady attacked himself.	374.7200616950649
“You love me, you!” cried he. “Oh, if that were so, I should lose my	428.98112205287
reason!”	299.4704499746765
And he folded her in his arms. She made no effort to remove her lips	489.7261124788272
from his kisses; only she did not respond to them. Her lips were cold;	304.82183052900893
it appeared to D’Artagnan that he had embraced a statue.	337.68473941829313
He was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love. He	383.1719791681357
almost believed in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the	295.7199876185612
crime of De Wardes. If De Wardes had at that moment been under his	473.1973995960226
hand, he would have killed him.	422.5108426825865
Milady seized the occasion.	335.31112335946204
“His name is—” said she, in her turn.	461.70156764919534
“De Wardes; I know it,” cried D’Artagnan.	474.5297419479939
“And how do you know it?” asked Milady, seizing both his hands, and	369.59637656074153
endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart.	441.82811964712096
D’Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he	458.1604860137538
had committed an error.	329.7431491591554
“Tell me, tell me, tell me, I say,” repeated Milady, “how do you know	322.380792155589
it?”	324.7717577741146
“How do I know it?” said D’Artagnan.	460.7853744908142
“Yes.”	413.2097638375172
“I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I	400.5953159338709
was, showed a ring which he said he had received from you.”	434.17140062701196
“Wretch!” cried Milady.	469.07989749614296
The epithet, as may be easily understood, resounded to the very bottom	329.0525942191433
of D’Artagnan’s heart.	389.023502500085
“Well?” continued she.	463.4315257660179
“Well, I will avenge you of this wretch,” replied D’Artagnan, giving	459.89168125606557
himself the airs of Don Japhet of Armenia.	416.7438487823635
“Thanks, my brave friend!” cried Milady; “and when shall I be avenged?”	315.195065230894
“Tomorrow—immediately—when you please!”	442.4773052330333
Milady was about to cry out, “Immediately,” but she reflected that such	491.4397428594345
precipitation would not be very gracious toward D’Artagnan.	418.1223868092467
Besides, she had a thousand precautions to take, a thousand counsels to	419.75333078684105
give to her defender, in order that he might avoid explanations with	301.11265571783997
the count before witnesses. All this was answered by an expression of	450.91268368714924
D’Artagnan’s. “Tomorrow,” said he, “you will be avenged, or I shall be	478.36851070841965
dead.”	431.26506161267116
“No,” said she, “you will avenge me; but you will not be dead. He is a	344.4796646853318
coward.”	410.4466276048806
“With women, perhaps; but not with men. I know something of him.”	307.4623790982123
“But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in	447.4905011163296
your contest with him.”	405.48614811318237
“Fortune is a courtesan; favorable yesterday, she may turn her back	317.4997221093983
tomorrow.”	441.9983371276975
“Which means that you now hesitate?”	301.4848331642733
“No, I do not hesitate; God forbid! But would it be just to allow me to	455.51985517570256
go to a possible death without having given me at least something more	382.4240376345272
than hope?”	468.9296004907019
Milady answered by a glance which said, “Is that all?—speak, then.” And	471.2254916245296
then accompanying the glance with explanatory words, “That is but too	318.59012658478804
just,” said she, tenderly.	409.3430723100669
“Oh, you are an angel!” exclaimed the young man.	357.3476425467849
“Then all is agreed?” said she.	360.38043038820064
“Except that which I ask of you, dear love.”	359.6184331073857
“But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?”	313.8069927721097
“I cannot wait till tomorrow.”	357.79611147311203
“Silence! I hear my brother. It will be useless for him to find you	475.135010606909
here.”	382.2291009101489
She rang the bell and Kitty appeared.	327.5397073904328
“Go out this way,” said she, opening a small private door, “and come	432.11084483354364
back at eleven o’clock; we will then terminate this conversation. Kitty	437.23241445066685
will conduct you to my chamber.”	489.1246631082763
The poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words.	367.5740842252764
“Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a	369.828103438153
statue? Do as I bid you: show the chevalier out; and this evening at	293.25621058105605
eleven o’clock—you have heard what I said.”	406.09693967623605
“It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o’clock,”	305.22460821432963
thought D’Artagnan; “that’s a settled custom.”	323.4152692545166
Milady held out her hand to him, which he kissed tenderly.	313.9428609848017
“But,” said he, as he retired as quickly as possible from the	335.020020411453
reproaches of Kitty, “I must not play the fool. This woman is certainly	474.02065142342377
a great liar. I must take care.”	415.9973960359375
Chapter XXXVII.	466.0738454827231
MILADY’S SECRET	300.27797897805897
D’Artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to Kitty’s	384.39194772737363
chamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do—and that for two	424.45935075363974
reasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches,	409.2282160874692
recriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to	458.97568146670903
have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if	336.7035665639449
possible, to fathom those of this woman.	347.91060883367993
What was most clear in the matter was that D’Artagnan loved Milady like	465.81052122896256
a madman, and that she did not love him at all. In an instant	471.48701253375964
D’Artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be	448.061918492745
to go home and write Milady a long letter, in which he would confess to	316.44890855292084
her that he and De Wardes were, up to the present moment absolutely the	328.3450284936462
same, and that consequently he could not undertake, without committing	401.17807792496063
suicide, to kill the Comte de Wardes. But he also was spurred on by a	396.372347729433
ferocious desire of vengeance. He wished to subdue this woman in his	432.4762433619585
own name; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain	399.6647434219852
sweetness in it, he could not make up his mind to renounce it.	408.82387694681864
He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale, turning at every	341.9551769385645
ten steps to look at the light in Milady’s apartment, which was to be	420.5648117271045
seen through the blinds. It was evident that this time the young woman	370.8740049577682
was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the	376.626124681223
first.	358.6456382300806
At length the light disappeared. With this light was extinguished the	315.3383688012185
last irresolution in the heart of D’Artagnan. He recalled to his mind	378.54216227588125
the details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on	452.57416697758833
fire he re-entered the hôtel and flew toward Kitty’s chamber.	308.9934245038458
The poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to	368.5635770068327
delay her lover; but Milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the	400.06529373443783
noise D’Artagnan had made, and opening the door, said, “Come in.”	387.3753525239609
All this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous	327.09931124611836
effrontery, that D’Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what	491.21190509979414
he heard. He imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic	451.55389369930697
intrigues one meets in dreams. He, however, darted not the less quickly	318.40404090728754
toward Milady, yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone	385.3475854463764
exercises over iron.	320.41625391284265
As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward it. Jealousy, fury,	362.66735467456454
offended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an	423.1789756467352
outraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she	317.8358304728962
reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having	363.46723768924807
assisted in such a machination, and above all, that D’Artagnan would	320.4964108858813
also be lost to her forever. This last thought of love counseled her to	390.19533780494487
make this last sacrifice.	319.00323014723216
D’Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. It	361.3627503071135
was no longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was	358.8218882803076
apparently beloved. A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of	473.1542120627578
his heart, that he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only	454.2756663231539
caressed till he had given death; but pride, but self-love, but madness	330.2549834762112
silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs. And then our Gascon, with	435.01686892357884
that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed, compared	447.38107152869577
himself with De Wardes, and asked himself why, after all, he should not	454.8970871463654
be beloved for himself?	352.93974161513313
He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment. Milady was no	442.6118403432031
longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment	324.55495547643415
terrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning	469.9183060414935
herself to love which she also seemed to feel. Two hours thus glided	473.3961439125435
away. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who	402.92568435816344
had not the same motives for forgetfulness that D’Artagnan had, was the	433.3012198115406
first to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which	394.25415036882737
were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and De Wardes	385.15071956859674
were already arranged in his mind.	368.11138012449516
But D’Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite another course, forgot	339.6998454230383
himself like a fool, and answered gallantly that it was too late to	440.61432808194616
think about duels and sword thrusts.	445.0149655318696
This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind	463.8008995363231
terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing.	460.9911354628702
Then D’Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible	379.5683826980194
duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed.	399.0348719191562
Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her	453.1687214539086
irresistible spirit and her iron will.	461.7639165294403
D’Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to	372.9557257520921
renounce, by pardoning De Wardes, the furious projects she had formed.	449.11228266957056
But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a	454.10114317390617
sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, “Are	406.4409124707432
you afraid, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan?”	452.6796027918592
“You cannot think so, dear love!” replied D’Artagnan; “but now, suppose	434.4117910493561
this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?”	478.08708457518946
“At all events,” said Milady, seriously, “he has deceived me, and from	355.73882979396643
the moment he deceived me, he merited death.”	301.0977559132473
“He shall die, then, since you condemn him!” said D’Artagnan, in so	439.1787076358965
firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion.	385.60408037028094
This reassured her.	396.5545390144927
We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but D’Artagnan	297.225018508356
believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through	359.75289596035475
the window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing	355.32660535631874
D’Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge	426.5625175192122
her on the Comte de Wardes.	396.70662555581407
“I am quite ready,” said D’Artagnan; “but in the first place I should	401.1770766060733
like to be certain of one thing.”	382.3953550537229
“And what is that?” asked Milady.	399.7550184371239
“That is, whether you really love me?”	412.23501119856996
“I have given you proof of that, it seems to me.”	377.75005398841563
“And I am yours, body and soul!”	490.33001217166577
“Thanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must,	366.72390482099723
in your turn, satisfy me of yours. Is it not so?”	482.07598322435996
“Certainly; but if you love me as much as you say,” replied D’Artagnan,	476.24334983808865
“do you not entertain a little fear on my account?”	356.8540021782685
“What have I to fear?”	411.3583931173468
“Why, that I may be dangerously wounded—killed even.”	435.0873917922727
“Impossible!” cried Milady, “you are such a valiant man, and such an	402.6090294571058
expert swordsman.”	428.44259239290693
“You would not, then, prefer a method,” resumed D’Artagnan, “which	385.4657828490144
would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless?”	416.0625591981071
Milady looked at her lover in silence. The pale light of the first rays	323.49288479785366
of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression.	449.954189678671
“Really,” said she, “I believe you now begin to hesitate.”	318.2816140591367
“No, I do not hesitate; but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes,	328.36599995239584
since you have ceased to love him. I think that a man must be so	413.5179638068824
severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no	335.8521512032198
other chastisement.”	373.7214100769785
“Who told you that I loved him?” asked Milady, sharply.	396.4825126549153
“At least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity,	431.0308228625414
that you love another,” said the young man, in a caressing tone, “and I	435.3413228646293
repeat that I am really interested for the count.”	413.3507915086958
“You?” asked Milady.	453.40325610050263
“Yes, I.”	426.60074962476835
“And why _you?_”	414.2922644718522
“Because I alone know—”	476.3803190606941
“What?”	404.4508852890468
“That he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you	387.09715957491784
as he appears.”	364.0396026940564
“Indeed!” said Milady, in an anxious tone; “explain yourself, for I	437.65514520721626
really cannot tell what you mean.”	379.4934090506122
And she looked at D’Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes	318.2251715221647
which seemed to burn themselves away.	405.30101823768564
“Yes; I am a man of honor,” said D’Artagnan, determined to come to an	325.5766836478309
end, “and since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it—for	477.09059176112913
I do possess it, do I not?”	487.1780545046238
“Entirely; go on.”	293.21910115274125
“Well, I feel as if transformed—a confession weighs on my mind.”	389.97175673486475
“A confession!”	430.31027883208446
“If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it, but you	425.9141546337779
love me, my beautiful mistress, do you not?”	368.2504775842952
“Without doubt.”	322.5287049108733
“Then if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward	414.2324279761391
you, you will pardon me?”	441.66987096060893
“Perhaps.”	347.77423692153667
D’Artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Milady’s,	476.87360139020734
but she evaded him.	355.2639311193826
“This confession,” said she, growing paler, “what is this confession?”	414.9737434293988
“You gave De Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room, did	343.2707747309462
you not?”	407.48241684857436
“No, no! It is not true,” said Milady, in a tone of voice so firm, and	363.332259282403
with a countenance so unchanged, that if D’Artagnan had not been in	476.29258518988956
such perfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.	396.1093947497337
“Do not lie, my angel,” said D’Artagnan, smiling; “that would be	326.04587979634636
useless.”	478.3588253335672
“What do you mean? Speak! you kill me.”	459.73737706220606
“Be satisfied; you are not guilty toward me, and I have already	309.51578339134966
pardoned you.”	329.29404260672663
“What next? what next?”	391.45465051459485
“De Wardes cannot boast of anything.”	429.532652730354
“How is that? You told me yourself that that ring—”	478.79377079357334
“That ring I have! The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the D’Artagnan	390.36533656556054
of today are the same person.”	420.5162484245976
The imprudent young man expected a surprise, mixed with shame—a slight	463.87077077546286
storm which would resolve itself into tears; but he was strangely	424.5017305852046
deceived, and his error was not of long duration.	341.7690518038233
Pale and trembling, Milady repulsed D’Artagnan’s attempted embrace by a	367.07685073778293
violent blow on the chest, as she sprang out of bed.	393.3758207942366
It was almost broad daylight.	309.35108961468427
D’Artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen, to	462.6700674215024
implore her pardon; but she, with a strong movement, tried to escape.	416.1377930028345
Then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders; and on one of	353.5324497186126
those lovely shoulders, round and white, D’Artagnan recognized, with	455.62514779197284
inexpressible astonishment, the _fleur-de-lis_—that indelible mark	463.1687383051643
which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted.	432.0859140642018
“Great God!” cried D’Artagnan, loosing his hold of her dress, and	386.01034528168105
remaining mute, motionless, and frozen.	486.0112226765376
But Milady felt herself denounced even by his terror. He had doubtless	407.4134282824974
seen all. The young man now knew her secret, her terrible secret—the	292.0629516775039
secret she concealed even from her maid with such care, the secret of	340.1417483767828
which all the world was ignorant, except himself.	366.9927295528664
She turned upon him, no longer like a furious woman, but like a wounded	393.8248036215996
panther.	366.38237243637155
“Ah, wretch!” cried she, “you have basely betrayed me, and still more,	381.9989908866912
you have my secret! You shall die.”	484.91059453465886
And she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing	333.6179103035077
table, opened it with a feverish and trembling hand, drew from it a	351.82033394245354
small poniard, with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade, and then	365.0519655558151
threw herself with a bound upon D’Artagnan.	371.6765043490069
Although the young man was brave, as we know, he was terrified at that	464.8382437464966
wild countenance, those terribly dilated pupils, those pale cheeks, and	452.98499473952427
those bleeding lips. He recoiled to the other side of the room as he	398.98976797194405
would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him, and his	374.60160658324895
sword coming in contact with his nervous hand, he drew it almost	437.20233014847537
unconsciously from the scabbard. But without taking any heed of the	378.27120315818183
sword, Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did	423.7220830782169
not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.	414.1547498819059
She then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but D’Artagnan kept	417.051850126933
it free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her	410.96446330295225
eyes, sometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the	490.01352761267003
bedstead, while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to	439.44929700682627
Kitty’s apartment.	467.71015158345585
Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury,	409.68770470544746
screaming in a formidable way.	433.26123594002706
As all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, D’Artagnan began	427.55121856757
to recover himself little by little.	301.30412375051117
“Well, beautiful lady, very well,” said he; “but, _pardieu_, if you	413.20566689234045
don’t calm yourself, I will design a second _fleur-de-lis_ upon one of	393.47286889427943
those pretty cheeks!”	385.2685053651147
“Scoundrel, infamous scoundrel!” howled Milady.	312.58826711206444
But D’Artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near to Kitty’s	411.4314411892732
door. At the noise they made, she in overturning the furniture in her	323.32558735016823
efforts to get at him, he in screening himself behind the furniture to	353.6597147753989
keep out of her reach, Kitty opened the door. D’Artagnan, who had	339.14567059781484
unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three	388.01589768201916
paces from it. With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into	389.3634881529292
that of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and	379.99117947031925
placed all his weight against it, while Kitty pushed the bolts.	415.66128594911083
Then Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase, with a strength	350.13301662393525
apparently above that of a woman; but finding she could not accomplish	401.8289544204392
this, she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard, the point	468.66589172935505
of which repeatedly glittered through the wood. Every blow was	471.5885131491969
accompanied with terrible imprecations.	384.64109425770863
“Quick, Kitty, quick!” said D’Artagnan, in a low voice, as soon as the	406.70912386637815
bolts were fast, “let me get out of the hôtel; for if we leave her time	354.5948209562338
to turn round, she will have me killed by the servants.”	292.86755929129953
“But you can’t go out so,” said Kitty; “you are naked.”	321.70277005825477
“That’s true,” said D’Artagnan, then first thinking of the costume he	353.1863150429041
found himself in, “that’s true. But dress me as well as you are able,	360.5789620302191
only make haste; think, my dear girl, it’s life and death!”	390.24710211360116
Kitty was but too well aware of that. In a turn of the hand she muffled	373.2429984393266
him up in a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak. She gave him some	427.3281340669733
slippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him	466.8144746990256
down the stairs. It was time. Milady had already rung her bell, and	477.18150001845834
roused the whole hôtel. The porter was drawing the cord at the moment	335.29715655955
Milady cried from her window, “Don’t open!”	387.8318104143568
The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	380.44688128121385
gesture. The moment she lost sight of him, Milady tumbled fainting into	344.00482035897517
her chamber.	408.9065093494961
Chapter XXXVIII.	365.90984807602626
HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT	441.65380922058284
D’Artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of	483.7662740343791
what might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and	387.2402402805201
did not stop till he came to Athos’s door. The confusion of his mind,	439.1397892105661
the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who	407.6568683213306
started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,	297.506622668196
notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him	338.78982529471637
precipitate his course.	348.15206296523314
He crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos’s apartment, and	430.5869990139155
knocked at the door enough to break it down.	436.80416186805724
Grimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,	446.4648384885769
and D’Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to	476.9702637838402
overturn the astonished lackey.	456.15689548656576
In spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his	302.0675797573921
speech.	441.8562255238519
“Holloa, there!” cried he; “what do you want, you strumpet? What’s your	408.7420729326914
business here, you hussy?”	319.2064641890357
D’Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds	312.75097177781777
of the cloak. At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor	432.8305728999304
devil perceived he had to deal with a man. He then concluded it must be	299.6651312521176
an assassin.	294.8023557851187
“Help! murder! help!” cried he.	352.85727453767254
“Hold your tongue, you stupid fellow!” said the young man; “I am	349.9637284851141
D’Artagnan; don’t you know me? Where is your master?”	312.1552188496951
“You, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried Grimaud, “impossible.”	329.251692835517
“Grimaud,” said Athos, coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown,	338.65077285255603
“Grimaud, I thought I heard you permitting yourself to speak?”	406.0706344917304
“Ah, monsieur, it is—”	375.7844519515311
“Silence!”	478.0285089871574
Grimaud contented himself with pointing D’Artagnan out to his master	351.74851741895554
with his finger.	347.86300725174897
Athos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into a	319.8512429255844
laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his	461.27499841877136
eyes—petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and	369.1198865369533
mustaches stiff with agitation.	475.7956079055225
“Don’t laugh, my friend!” cried D’Artagnan; “for heaven’s sake, don’t	377.52700819492907
laugh, for upon my soul, it’s no laughing matter!”	364.1520796312478
And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a	488.60913971646005
real appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,	457.17080439240453
“Are you wounded, my friend? How pale you are!”	462.2640305222334
“No, but I have just met with a terrible adventure! Are you alone,	307.1787292157464
Athos?”	450.98793741857514
“_Parbleu!_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?”	295.8179023056786
“Well, well!” and D’Artagnan rushed into Athos’s chamber.	393.8149043418279
“Come, speak!” said the latter, closing the door and bolting it, that	491.62795134069563
they might not be disturbed. “Is the king dead? Have you killed the	310.06609776215555
cardinal? You are quite upset! Come, come, tell me; I am dying with	463.05160526512407
curiosity and uneasiness!”	336.37649693010326
“Athos,” said D’Artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and	382.10017040377863
appearing in his shirt, “prepare yourself to hear an incredible, an	437.0405453652178
unheard-of story.”	367.09591633026105
“Well, but put on this dressing gown first,” said the Musketeer to his	297.27995666008513
friend.	449.69351054533706
D’Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve	458.30332390679337
for the other, so greatly was he still agitated.	347.49775286012425
“Well?” said Athos.	431.4983472207741
“Well,” replied D’Artagnan, bending his mouth to Athos’s ear, and	318.48053561319495
lowering his voice, “Milady is marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ upon her	310.657975544857
shoulder!”	433.1728647495559
“Ah!” cried the Musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart.	428.50461913376176
“Let us see,” said D’Artagnan. “Are you _sure_ that the _other_ is	473.8848510818689
dead?”	364.824776870203
“_The other?_” said Athos, in so stifled a voice that D’Artagnan	297.0565042751336
scarcely heard him.	470.12340702593013
“Yes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.”	430.6191735457469
Athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.	411.4611592320311
“This is a woman of twenty-six or twenty-eight years.”	424.1935345743292
“Fair,” said Athos, “is she not?”	441.25710567506405
“Very.”	395.04778004980255
“Blue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and	482.0963863644196
eyebrows?”	474.1205197828579
“Yes.”	448.3890074220519
“Tall, well-made? She has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the	400.01082424050094
left?”	325.82388191902606
“Yes.”	442.0934198295712
“The _fleur-de-lis_ is small, rosy in color, and looks as if efforts	443.51376259935967
had been made to efface it by the application of poultices?”	470.1045021818168
“Yes.”	387.8014602159623
“But you say she is English?”	455.04371364693634
“She is called Milady, but she may be French. Lord de Winter is only	474.84778152712363
her brother-in-law.”	481.08777602872783
“I will see her, D’Artagnan!”	313.0004046255135
“Beware, Athos, beware. You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return	422.9452219617501
you the like, and not to fail.”	350.12754451619423
“She will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself.”	435.1172146863753
“She is capable of anything or everything. Did you ever see her	333.0540708869014
furious?”	475.80967014661223
“No,” said Athos.	311.9941983122786
“A tigress, a panther! Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have	293.570491152279
drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!”	383.1348361034137
D’Artagnan then related all—the mad passion of Milady and her menaces	431.4762162548152
of death.	419.48023448230543
“You are right; and upon my soul, I would give my life for a hair,”	385.2611746889878
said Athos. “Fortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave Paris. We are	440.33756671622655
going according to all probability to La Rochelle, and once gone—”	464.4629491291481
“She will follow you to the end of the world, Athos, if she recognizes	459.95690105389224
you. Let her, then, exhaust her vengeance on me alone!”	292.670231193104
“My dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?” said	417.46518178524997
Athos. “Do you, perchance, think I set any great store by life?”	331.8890607226075
“There is something horribly mysterious under all this, Athos; this	307.22543375024856
woman is one of the cardinal’s spies, I am sure of that.”	299.6624715413875
“In that case, take care! If the cardinal does not hold you in high	449.20551602211816
admiration for the affair of London, he entertains a great hatred for	474.51555413487915
you; but as, considering everything, he cannot accuse you openly, and	308.17599117066203
as hatred must be satisfied, particularly when it’s a cardinal’s	409.93202147407175
hatred, take care of yourself. If you go out, do not go out alone; when	345.1027085192578
you eat, use every precaution. Mistrust everything, in short, even your	355.13728962689925
own shadow.”	342.8610540180302
“Fortunately,” said D’Artagnan, “all this will be only necessary till	345.4461250655685
after tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, I	418.7323955222037
hope, only men to dread.”	457.9338965828565
“In the meantime,” said Athos, “I renounce my plan of seclusion, and	469.82931968908724
wherever you go, I will go with you. You must return to the Rue des	464.5924462411151
Fossoyeurs; I will accompany you.”	371.1046150267575
“But however near it may be,” replied D’Artagnan, “I cannot go thither	322.6181068724961
in this guise.”	402.6173479418602
“That’s true,” said Athos, and he rang the bell.	314.9371670312532
Grimaud entered.	485.23638939241914
Athos made him a sign to go to D’Artagnan’s residence, and bring back	469.76432565660065
some clothes. Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood	476.2032699641152
perfectly, and set off.	435.969114682827
“All this will not advance your outfit,” said Athos; “for if I am not	376.149259377418
mistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with Milady, and she	425.92867552489105
will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you.	381.54993262872335
Fortunately, you have the sapphire.”	465.84285021142114
“The jewel is yours, my dear Athos! Did you not tell me it was a family	298.4145145037404
jewel?”	457.06448990772475
“Yes, my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it, as he once told	316.38924485601814
me. It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife, and it is	466.7839787253444
magnificent. My mother gave it to me, and I, fool as I was, instead of	313.6320149455861
keeping the ring as a holy relic, gave it to this wretch.”	431.43203128500056
“Then, my friend, take back this ring, to which I see you attach much	317.89316485747196
value.”	319.5370469148986
“I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that	449.755431002665
infamous creature? Never; that ring is defiled, D’Artagnan.”	486.41698525242356
“Sell it, then.”	326.7891834825577
“Sell a jewel which came from my mother! I vow I should consider it a	442.6806274150372
profanation.”	379.36349259228246
“Pledge it, then; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it. With	392.1842995703282
that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and	434.9298205426503
when you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back	418.6314284057362
cleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the	415.8589331537877
hands of usurers.”	437.08519026248644
Athos smiled.	472.8349227445231
“You are a capital companion, D’Artagnan,” said he; “your never-failing	337.9558167667283
cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. Well, let us pledge the	329.3821265077379
ring, but upon one condition.”	450.41438944789
“What?”	294.7032516527366
“That there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred	354.39611423127866
crowns for me.”	433.9748363958727
“Don’t dream it, Athos. I don’t need the quarter of such a sum—I who am	394.48549868701457
still only in the Guards—and by selling my saddles, I shall procure it.	382.32142934535466
What do I want? A horse for Planchet, that’s all. Besides, you forget	318.01915940605073
that I have a ring likewise.”	391.49602513044925
“To which you attach more value, it seems, than I do to mine; at least,	466.70819725944784
I have thought so.”	369.42806888452606
“Yes, for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us	467.1773657832123
from some great embarrassment, but even a great danger. It is not only	323.78022607458496
a valuable diamond, but it is an enchanted talisman.”	410.0781806755541
“I don’t at all understand you, but I believe all you say to be true.	433.02723623032546
Let us return to my ring, or rather to yours. You shall take half the	367.1275283936839
sum that will be advanced upon it, or I will throw it into the Seine;	409.99298971851863
and I doubt, as was the case with Polycrates, whether any fish will be	389.407249993808
sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us.”	300.78874805996196
“Well, I will take it, then,” said D’Artagnan.	307.6064612460153
At this moment Grimaud returned, accompanied by Planchet; the latter,	365.80876937039574
anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,	455.13128855255934
had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments	311.0407054978208
himself.	308.27026934562235
D’Artagnan dressed himself, and Athos did the same. When the two were	406.25430254087377
ready to go out, the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,	433.69548875816804
and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to	415.9023316587951
follow his master.	490.8495239139886
They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoyeurs. Bonacieux was	473.7610274143245
standing at the door, and looked at D’Artagnan hatefully.	317.3486736841357
“Make haste, dear lodger,” said he; “there is a very pretty girl	338.1839402025512
waiting for you upstairs; and you know women don’t like to be kept	387.09368849912187
waiting.”	468.3467878596113
“That’s Kitty!” said D’Artagnan to himself, and darted into the	456.58685855625833
passage.	443.0145984893959
Sure enough! Upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching	474.86369133306164
against the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble. As soon as	406.58540736000845
she perceived him, she cried, “You have promised your protection; you	350.4800647862318
have promised to save me from her anger. Remember, it is you who have	292.85841074772014
ruined me!”	425.1045586906349
“Yes, yes, to be sure, Kitty,” said D’Artagnan; “be at ease, my girl.	368.65104557939105
But what happened after my departure?”	490.82346916143666
“How can I tell!” said Kitty. “The lackeys were brought by the cries	480.4800745528863
she made. She was mad with passion. There exist no imprecations she did	315.1181141253446
not pour out against you. Then I thought she would remember it was	446.2785482573367
through my chamber you had penetrated hers, and that then she would	414.41837214687536
suppose I was your accomplice; so I took what little money I had and	382.9904157554604
the best of my things, and I got away.	317.7123424425026
“Poor dear girl! But what can I do with you? I am going away the day	305.19429934590727
after tomorrow.”	402.4501821139955
“Do what you please, Monsieur Chevalier. Help me out of Paris; help me	342.6322203015557
out of France!”	374.13615138975837
“I cannot take you, however, to the siege of La Rochelle,” said	458.595053002689
D’Artagnan.	343.4258926860848
“No; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of	316.53788819446333
your acquaintance—in your own country, for instance.”	405.49663806961007
“My dear little love! In my country the ladies do without chambermaids.	414.90828685583085
But stop! I can manage your business for you. Planchet, go and find	455.89430659797875
Aramis. Request him to come here directly. We have something very	457.1753266634236
important to say to him.”	457.3372501794019
“I understand,” said Athos; “but why not Porthos? I should have thought	427.0373001676526
that his duchess—”	374.0487453874411
“Oh, Porthos’s duchess is dressed by her husband’s clerks,” said	420.04444132999333
D’Artagnan, laughing. “Besides, Kitty would not like to live in the Rue	364.26203775060446
aux Ours. Isn’t it so, Kitty?”	489.7722543940266
“I do not care where I live,” said Kitty, “provided I am well	308.7151775352172
concealed, and nobody knows where I am.”	357.48555852360414
“Meanwhile, Kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer	352.73962912869143
jealous of me—”	426.2628268609031
“Monsieur Chevalier, far off or near,” said Kitty, “I shall always love	308.11706215517995
you.”	334.0889189455063
“Where the devil will constancy niche itself next?” murmured Athos.	413.2757022906987
“And I, also,” said D’Artagnan, “I also. I shall always love you; be	373.6954867523143
sure of that. But now answer me. I attach great importance to the	406.19621119302303
question I am about to put to you. Did you never hear talk of a young	311.89868481469364
woman who was carried off one night?”	465.3740267173779
“There, now! Oh, Monsieur Chevalier, do you love that woman still?”	457.7671311424429
“No, no; it is one of my friends who loves her—Monsieur Athos, this	392.7313830861464
gentleman here.”	347.65900918721394
“I?” cried Athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is	326.9385998440254
about to tread upon an adder.	416.5013013193579
“You, to be sure!” said D’Artagnan, pressing Athos’s hand. “You know	480.064920749092
the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux.	464.08854148385296
Besides, Kitty will tell nothing; will you, Kitty? You understand, my	301.2673286974624
dear girl,” continued D’Artagnan, “she is the wife of that frightful	305.9261457789243
baboon you saw at the door as you came in.”	414.658212173896
“Oh, my God! You remind me of my fright! If he should have known me	383.58943482540474
again!”	472.3201801273615
“How? know you again? Did you ever see that man before?”	372.583317559521
“He came twice to Milady’s.”	477.87872439106775
“That’s it. About what time?”	360.36081306997613
“Why, about fifteen or eighteen days ago.”	415.3340256908117
“Exactly so.”	442.46030290765236
“And yesterday evening he came again.”	414.83055305710127
“Yesterday evening?”	377.9101540649542
“Yes, just before you came.”	311.4450848898806
“My dear Athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. And do you	307.9410010590783
believe he knew you again, Kitty?”	366.0708313838067
“I pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him, but perhaps it was too	433.8687652591557
late.”	323.0592456686024
“Go down, Athos—he mistrusts you less than me—and see if he be still at	486.7490607487275
his door.”	449.07715282632273
Athos went down and returned immediately.	407.2928754245196
“He has gone,” said he, “and the house door is shut.”	380.8873118835538
“He has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at	428.50857481182504
this moment in the dovecot.”	386.65022490550035
“Well, then, let us all fly,” said Athos, “and leave nobody here but	481.4236035471795
Planchet to bring us news.”	429.3839161195848
“A minute. Aramis, whom we have sent for!”	326.2067856673188
“That’s true,” said Athos; “we must wait for Aramis.”	354.7127274937432
At that moment Aramis entered.	308.16027315756344
The matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to	480.2581744347514
understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for	368.8626618501906
Kitty.	330.64883704755783
Aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, “Will it be	419.10735526209487
really rendering you a service, D’Artagnan?”	374.28425469227375
“I shall be grateful to you all my life.”	455.39446293908827
“Very well. Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who	438.06304831734747
resides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid. If you	423.9407888219726
can, my dear D’Artagnan, answer for Mademoiselle—”	450.64553960715125
“Oh, monsieur, be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the	408.0593189303509
person who will give me the means of quitting Paris.”	410.4994478456469
“Then,” said Aramis, “this falls out very well.”	321.2933031736847
He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed	372.02275960046404
with a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty.	345.940542314948
“And now, my dear girl,” said D’Artagnan, “you know that it is not good	391.1108369997095
for any of us to be here. Therefore let us separate. We shall meet	319.6795169007732
again in better days.”	294.94548412770735
“And whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be,” said	328.3658583923491
Kitty, “you will find me loving you as I love you today.”	424.0632119031833
“Dicers’ oaths!” said Athos, while D’Artagnan went to conduct Kitty	350.19606349222397
downstairs.	357.7588684905597
An instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet	426.57699461979746
again at four o’clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the	414.5188797702138
house.	331.22761693413935
Aramis returned home, and Athos and D’Artagnan busied themselves about	427.4684827574582
pledging the sapphire.	395.3459447494639
As the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles	480.36852536309357
on the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell	448.98425285719895
it to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he	346.56055202580353
would give five hundred pistoles for it.	468.17857749047056
Athos and D’Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the	306.38603871146256
knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase	474.9299987907604
the entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy,	402.3583919291543
and a noble to his fingers’ ends. When a thing suited him he paid the	350.97109325055294
price demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. D’Artagnan	297.84618683077247
would have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his	447.17942794807516
shoulder, with a smile, and D’Artagnan understood that it was all very	294.6743587588699
well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain,	297.61657485536836
but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince. The Musketeer met	358.0521617443992
with a superb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs	315.2718116084754
clean and elegant, rising six years. He examined him, and found him	409.0976815999577
sound and without blemish. They asked a thousand livres for him.	318.13489227522814
He might perhaps have been bought for less; but while D’Artagnan was	365.640027040921
discussing the price with the dealer, Athos was counting out the money	405.63370095830584
on the table.	297.349662556988
Grimaud had a stout, short Picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.	472.8235174206227
But when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased, Athos had not	428.6605806559736
a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles. D’Artagnan offered his	397.6008376102576
friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient.	371.78485082990306
But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.	369.81126056745137
“How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he	316.93251911185837
purchased it?” said Athos.	422.9724015356245
“Five hundred pistoles.”	331.7257145201234
“That is to say, two hundred more—a hundred pistoles for you and a	360.8125051919524
hundred pistoles for me. Well, now, that would be a real fortune to us,	340.432844924887
my friend; let us go back to the Jew’s again.”	460.57515016346065
“What! will you—”	318.1139707071769
“This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then	334.10201228080666
we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so	346.99414605161826
that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain. Go and	364.5897457573833
tell him the ring is his, D’Artagnan, and bring back the two hundred	307.21481773484504
pistoles with you.”	421.96195424616076
“Reflect, Athos!”	423.2967560525417
“Ready money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to	379.73092901373
make sacrifices. Go, D’Artagnan, go; Grimaud will accompany you with	484.98831747958684
his musketoon.”	395.6576544726033
A half hour afterward, D’Artagnan returned with the two thousand	300.8232010681206
livres, and without having met with any accident.	292.60009812820255
It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect.	397.79136501260206
Chapter XXXIX.	413.04814315262917
A VISION	297.46924391095826
At four o’clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos. Their	466.87426632153915
anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance	299.07762698380157
only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet—for behind all	423.1586625582652
present happiness is concealed a fear for the future.	298.49832897860045
Suddenly Planchet entered, bringing two letters for D’Artagnan.	393.4130581647991
The one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in	338.1708427331303
green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.	414.791010416729
The other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible	397.10465154808173
arms of his Eminence the cardinal duke.	350.44646568693184
At the sight of the little letter the heart of D’Artagnan bounded, for	363.9449414913672
he believed he recognized the handwriting, and although he had seen	411.0172061276806
that writing but once, the memory of it remained at the bottom of his	477.93780017684355
heart.	452.4963829359646
He therefore seized the little epistle, and opened it eagerly.	468.73727205757746
“Be,” said the letter, “on Thursday next, at from six to seven o’clock	457.08018606310367
in the evening, on the road to Chaillot, and look carefully into the	462.34866289513934
carriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own	429.43823433068104
life or that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not	397.2529197336587
make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized	457.552496200232
her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but	491.4473053000831
for an instant.”	297.93049487190916
No signature.	294.1881999424473
“That’s a snare,” said Athos; “don’t go, D’Artagnan.”	438.7642848584986
“And yet,” replied D’Artagnan, “I think I recognize the writing.”	479.45314704679515
“It may be counterfeit,” said Athos. “Between six and seven o’clock the	380.00633257942326
road of Chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in	340.59466076244473
the forest of Bondy.”	358.42257748444746
“But suppose we all go,” said D’Artagnan; “what the devil! They won’t	400.02602685216044
devour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!”	435.03023983484456
“And besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,”	361.99286801174384
said Porthos.	339.57311918893686
“But if it is a woman who writes,” said Aramis, “and that woman desires	338.4753469998386
not to be seen, remember, you compromise her, D’Artagnan; which is not	339.78216369339054
the part of a gentleman.”	341.5307653458565
“We will remain in the background,” said Porthos, “and he will advance	307.58856497495196
alone.”	298.92974494339484
“Yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a	352.7691559771558
gallop.”	330.9010452254358
“Bah!” said D’Artagnan, “they will miss me; if they fire we will ride	369.36074152459446
after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. They must	313.834170143981
be enemies.”	455.2184585759851
“He is right,” said Porthos; “battle. Besides, we must try our own	384.09954129766953
arms.”	423.61923848162587
“Bah, let us enjoy that pleasure,” said Aramis, with his mild and	374.1474277063174
careless manner.	449.02671487708676
“As you please,” said Athos.	389.8041081890707
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “it is half past four, and we have	348.14084698577295
scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six.”	411.92321358241645
“Besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us,” said Porthos,	393.1707776747876
“and that will be a pity. Let us get ready, gentlemen.”	434.7173166586217
“But this second letter,” said Athos, “you forget that; it appears to	351.2207081588209
me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. For	333.99748517107514
my part, I declare, D’Artagnan, I think it of much more consequence	321.6473859343774
than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into	345.474393334121
your bosom.”	476.84258161121363
D’Artagnan blushed.	472.2952348256439
“Well,” said he, “let us see, gentlemen, what are his Eminence’s	454.6722134841894
commands,” and D’Artagnan unsealed the letter and read,	475.7977718519757
“M. d’Artagnan, of the king’s Guards, company Dessessart, is expected	348.181188315503
at the Palais-Cardinal this evening, at eight o’clock.	316.05360328875895
“LA HOUDINIERE, _Captain of the Guards_”	369.74680388677336
“The devil!” said Athos; “here’s a rendezvous much more serious than	373.11403765591837
the other.”	438.0700430058579
“I will go to the second after attending the first,” said D’Artagnan.	377.5407639810144
“One is for seven o’clock, and the other for eight; there will be time	292.73949971211283
for both.”	397.99819893154904
“Hum! I would not go at all,” said Aramis. “A gallant knight cannot	481.80478559866077
decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse	441.65347823577963
himself from not waiting on his Eminence, particularly when he has	300.6929111585361
reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments.”	388.21742727076736
“I am of Aramis’s opinion,” said Porthos.	401.2369533423848
“Gentlemen,” replied D’Artagnan, “I have already received by Monsieur	435.660662250677
de Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence. I neglected it, and	450.6312935509452
on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me—Constance	382.8320595344035
disappeared. Whatever may ensue, I will go.”	460.87939078493514
“If you are determined,” said Athos, “do so.”	460.94358938810785
“But the Bastille?” said Aramis.	360.23725929748804
“Bah! you will get me out if they put me there,” said D’Artagnan.	483.0968059353338
“To be sure we will,” replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable	332.84337286354844
promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the	427.55354025408826
world, “to be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set	428.91307101547136
off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this	449.4780118934936
Bastille.”	321.68053875445645
“Let us do better than that,” said Athos; “do not let us leave him	308.1210605938968
during the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace	402.4705583721653
with three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all	446.6156220571718
suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long	437.10160655707625
time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the	452.321943798765
Cardinal; Monsieur de Tréville must think us dead.”	477.96541057192286
“To a certainty, Athos,” said Aramis, “you were meant to be a general	307.38354585083556
of the army! What do you think of the plan, gentlemen?”	451.9330205568572
“Admirable!” replied the young men in chorus.	367.5345459449901
“Well,” said Porthos, “I will run to the hôtel, and engage our comrades	331.88424279517704
to hold themselves in readiness by eight o’clock; the rendezvous, the	434.0640947522152
Place du Palais-Cardinal. Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the	310.68632410431394
horses.”	477.94102960241344
“I have no horse,” said D’Artagnan; “but that is of no consequence, I	400.62992284074016
can take one of Monsieur de Tréville’s.”	478.58479806990016
“That is not worth while,” said Aramis, “you can have one of mine.”	395.5540464398057
“One of yours! how many have you, then?” asked D’Artagnan.	352.79639700775266
“Three,” replied Aramis, smiling.	333.6410649955567
“_Certes_,” cried Athos, “you are the best-mounted poet of France or	421.47587307601634
Navarre.”	448.048177070613
“Well, my dear Aramis, you don’t want three horses? I cannot comprehend	489.1427774282772
what induced you to buy three!”	330.3353343793884
“Therefore I only purchased two,” said Aramis.	415.05372851426785
“The third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?”	400.2942215290327
“No, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of	406.5537368489727
livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he	377.643940321944
had received orders from his master.”	486.9009926464991
“Or his mistress,” interrupted D’Artagnan.	455.7733934381889
“That makes no difference,” said Aramis, coloring; “and who affirmed,	357.43732322110634
as I said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to	313.71793087678043
place the horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came.”	474.3910441719589
“It is only to poets that such things happen,” said Athos, gravely.	450.3512966141085
“Well, in that case, we can manage famously,” said D’Artagnan; “which	330.92619639119533
of the two horses will you ride—that which you bought or the one that	367.9846516419426
was given to you?”	443.4266447020756
“That which was given to me, assuredly. You cannot for a moment	412.72601620823576
imagine, D’Artagnan, that I would commit such an offense toward—”	394.21306067266335
“The unknown giver,” interrupted D’Artagnan.	461.36925709425196
“Or the mysterious benefactress,” said Athos.	485.16086827001664
“The one you bought will then become useless to you?”	360.80235402248144
“Nearly so.”	464.90662776118666
“And you selected it yourself?”	356.25457464264696
“With the greatest care. The safety of the horseman, you know, depends	355.6632893895419
almost always upon the goodness of his horse.”	487.67382853272477
“Well, transfer it to me at the price it cost you?”	302.8884260193643
“I was going to make you the offer, my dear D’Artagnan, giving you all	321.8166345728274
the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle.”	298.96055263097634
“How much did it cost you?”	460.82093605668155
“Eight hundred livres.”	355.36366360070423
“Here are forty double pistoles, my dear friend,” said D’Artagnan,	325.64577144054186
taking the sum from his pocket; “I know that is the coin in which you	302.83016306811396
were paid for your poems.”	325.645401716285
“You are rich, then?” said Aramis.	458.5233928238442
“Rich? Richest, my dear fellow!”	456.7798406640244
And D’Artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.	399.92208573635656
“Send your saddle, then, to the hôtel of the Musketeers, and your horse	453.4792201506515
can be brought back with ours.”	314.19546483881845
“Very well; but it is already five o’clock, so make haste.”	414.5577326402164
A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue	303.09909455117804
Férou on a very handsome _genet_. Mousqueton followed him upon an	479.95697352111995
Auvergne horse, small but very handsome. Porthos was resplendent with	313.74088679518115
joy and pride.	410.15729790658577
At the same time, Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the	334.6582147189327
street upon a superb English charger. Bazin followed him upon a roan,	364.00598127191455
holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was	391.1403712298863
D’Artagnan’s mount.	486.507832144618
The two Musketeers met at the gate. Athos and D’Artagnan watched their	398.85788839758783
approach from the window.	417.85621013924293
“The devil!” cried Aramis, “you have a magnificent horse there,	439.4116078556584
Porthos.”	292.3728723303971
“Yes,” replied Porthos, “it is the one that ought to have been sent to	357.70968386000385
me at first. A bad joke of the husband’s substituted the other; but the	468.605118917033
husband has been punished since, and I have obtained full	405.8562583796692
satisfaction.”	445.4236156314277
Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters’	314.25003180014795
steeds. D’Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their	311.6180476862399
companions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a	292.8050776289492
woman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he	326.03750195949
owed to his procurator’s wife, and D’Artagnan on a horse he owed to his	356.453558231098
good fortune—the best mistress possible.	338.31161115636746
The lackeys followed.	354.98284747350357
As Porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if	398.20297722350125
Mme. Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he	476.01311756832774
made upon his handsome Spanish _genet_, she would not have regretted	420.0756953761416
the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.	488.7461345482962
Near the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Tréville, who was	346.11004645724154
returning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments	404.3100042046517
upon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred	299.46610307465323
gapers.	343.00582158274597
D’Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Tréville of	461.95780901189653
the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal’s arms. It is well	479.1587548457985
understood that he did not breathe a word about the other.	462.6512628710808
M. de Tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured	390.73230818614314
him that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake	452.4839403541782
to find him, let him be where he might.	459.2545949272808
At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six; the four friends	333.82201288343015
pleaded an engagement, and took leave of M. de Tréville.	421.1344937349942
A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to	448.77610239028706
decline, carriages were passing and repassing. D’Artagnan, keeping at	465.56121788028634
some distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every	316.9444066002264
carriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted.	486.9548188288063
At length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was	435.506457380024
beginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on	489.5675121277105
the road of Sèvres. A presentiment instantly told D’Artagnan that this	300.2158398562507
carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous; the	396.7173698849012
young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently.	477.27959111240483
Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window, with two	331.8375611686729
fingers placed upon her mouth, either to enjoin silence or to send him	304.52785109579617
a kiss. D’Artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy; this woman, or rather	400.20485559307747
this apparition—for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a	307.64512996045636
vision—was Mme. Bonacieux.	476.4567799081806
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given,	461.1534047527158
D’Artagnan put his horse into a gallop, and in a few strides overtook	357.37726513364225
the carriage; but the window was hermetically closed, the vision had	301.40578167151745
disappeared.	356.48009484851383
D’Artagnan then remembered the injunction: “If you value your own life	326.39407501073214
or that of those who love you, remain motionless, and as if you had	348.99135603907655
seen nothing.”	461.9432812977439
He stopped, therefore, trembling not for himself but for the poor woman	317.6057690915862
who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this	353.62125882158716
rendezvous.	360.49709353063963
The carriage pursued its way, still going at a great pace, till it	321.964274334147
dashed into Paris, and disappeared.	341.0682671462167
D’Artagnan remained fixed to the spot, astounded and not knowing what	455.3441515058279
to think. If it was Mme. Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris,	329.4071942704304
why this fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why	379.97598565106745
this lost kiss? If, on the other side, it was not she—which was still	296.86806794213294
quite possible—for the little light that remained rendered a mistake	418.4336202621437
easy—might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through	439.91473546550714
the allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?	341.2117044486843
His three companions joined him. All had plainly seen a woman’s head	302.94060286443835
appear at the window, but none of them, except Athos, knew Mme.	446.1773754055016
Bonacieux. The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she; but less	329.9388075007973
preoccupied by that pretty face than D’Artagnan, he had fancied he saw	406.75864252868547
a second head, a man’s head, inside the carriage.	383.8420129754388
“If that be the case,” said D’Artagnan, “they are doubtless	367.3326004786796
transporting her from one prison to another. But what can they intend	479.0755215429804
to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?”	315.08768342336265
“Friend,” said Athos, gravely, “remember that it is the dead alone with	301.5168716298069
whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth. You know something	461.7915916816861
of that, as well as I do, I think. Now, if your mistress is not dead,	435.48799347090824
if it is she we have just seen, you will meet with her again some day	395.6417244362893
or other. And perhaps, my God!” added he, with that misanthropic tone	472.20266242859077
which was peculiar to him, “perhaps sooner than you wish.”	484.3335036751688
Half past seven had sounded. The carriage had been twenty minutes	418.27382330515115
behind the time appointed. D’Artagnan’s friends reminded him that he	373.0075787921112
had a visit to pay, but at the same time bade him observe that there	358.2453810926596
was yet time to retract.	312.741413480843
But D’Artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious. He had made	441.0372901677498
up his mind that he would go to the Palais-Cardinal, and that he would	381.3337624484831
learn what his Eminence had to say to him. Nothing could turn him from	409.66217144553076
his purpose.	418.5816363364884
They reached the Rue St. Honoré, and in the Place du Palais-Cardinal	455.12813244267943
they found the twelve invited Musketeers, walking about in expectation	344.15455769743
of their comrades. There only they explained to them the matter in	459.9105791701155
hand.	454.8536623425151
D’Artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king’s	439.3383798314161
Musketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he	331.19097410578183
was considered beforehand as a comrade. It resulted from these	299.0643073759835
antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which	451.3001678296473
they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an	393.83690068013345
opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,	476.656530340113
and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.	425.3802094769075
Athos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave	363.4055516850993
the second to Aramis, and the third to Porthos; and then each group	412.6107500650043
went and took their watch near an entrance.	398.4677003242671
D’Artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.	416.6414609804616
Although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without	378.13664087409813
a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step.	309.74293671022633
His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and	422.4195451331635
he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between	460.03919942850143
that woman and the cardinal. Still further, De Wardes, whom he had	367.4496156031927
treated so ill, was one of the tools of his Eminence; and D’Artagnan	415.8044616884365
knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies, he was	302.86602583147555
strongly attached to his friends.	450.96084448643455
“If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal, which is not	339.2647259188675
to be doubted, and if he has recognized me, as is probable, I may	424.90159849388203
consider myself almost as a condemned man,” said D’Artagnan, shaking	358.62279342548834
his head. “But why has he waited till now? That’s all plain enough.	380.17717404013104
Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief	331.682198756599
which renders her so interesting, and this last offense has made the	330.7471339733817
cup overflow.”	482.2318741353333
“Fortunately,” added he, “my good friends are down yonder, and they	423.31480007925154
will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle. Nevertheless,	432.1549254352334
Monsieur de Tréville’s company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a	338.21337290129816
war against the cardinal, who disposes of the forces of all France, and	303.5879000046813
before whom the queen is without power and the king without will.	297.1604192600272
D’Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have	459.50151535491403
excellent qualities; but the women will ruin you!”	489.59906180961787
He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber. He	433.6859032600887
placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty, who led him into	362.04311278204216
the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace.	461.45555729389673
In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal’s Guards, who	309.16915379554365
recognized D’Artagnan, and knowing that it was he who had wounded	369.92925961438584
Jussac, they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning.	459.6808391963764
This smile appeared to D’Artagnan to be of bad augury. Only, as our	435.3156131260815
Gascon was not easily intimidated—or rather, thanks to a great pride	327.974721967025
natural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to see	431.12278685070925
what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all	454.6293902863517
resembled fear—he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the	412.942617259161
Guards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means	487.7147325901508
deficient in majesty.	379.3393066634302
The usher returned and made a sign to D’Artagnan to follow him. It	420.29040795207806
appeared to the young man that the Guards, on seeing him depart,	446.7094412319223
chuckled among themselves.	402.2725994343506
He traversed a corridor, crossed a grand saloon, entered a library, and	388.1239271879963
found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing.	454.41899596483796
The usher introduced him, and retired without speaking a word.	407.23117941212536
D’Artagnan remained standing and examined this man.	383.7436398853277
D’Artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge	446.94676993593396
examining his papers; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote,	390.6814978323064
or rather corrected, lines of unequal length, scanning the words on his	398.0411187759261
fingers. He saw then that he was with a poet. At the end of an instant	310.1254382608397
the poet closed his manuscript, upon the cover of which was written	389.70560652027007
“Mirame, a Tragedy in Five Acts,” and raised his head.	377.37618639404
D’Artagnan recognized the cardinal.	353.35638760827453
Chapter XL.	380.3989263365717
A TERRIBLE VISION	330.6790757193844
The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript, his cheek upon his	384.54104444794575
hand, and looked intently at the young man for a moment. No one had a	332.6046130153915
more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu, and D’Artagnan felt	376.11592284529723
this glance run through his veins like a fever.	303.3011937120683
He however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his hand and	385.40926638763864
awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without too much assurance,	395.11414552686483
but also without too much humility.	294.4994514634099
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “are you a D’Artagnan from Béarn?”	361.4861581630556
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the young man.	364.0895708210611
“There are several branches of the D’Artagnans at Tarbes and in its	385.77258713193896
environs,” said the cardinal; “to which do you belong?”	440.18004538154656
“I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great	347.4513301932587
King Henry, the father of his gracious Majesty.”	350.49439861825476
“That is well. It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from	434.1433708716762
your country to seek your fortune in the capital?”	298.24892248276444
“Yes, monseigneur.”	442.07026476830265
“You came through Meung, where something befell you. I don’t very well	472.8699795318473
know what, but still something.”	459.0218536004571
“Monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, “this was what happened to me—”	299.3183024017162
“Never mind, never mind!” resumed the cardinal, with a smile which	347.4924587239636
indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it.	451.4969894896369
“You were recommended to Monsieur de Tréville, were you not?”	385.2493084158952
“Yes, monseigneur; but in that unfortunate affair at Meung—”	329.89866956869764
“The letter was lost,” replied his Eminence; “yes, I know that. But	341.1670595745268
Monsieur de Tréville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first	387.68979812914563
sight; and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur	322.970083742556
Dessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter	340.15591095024274
the Musketeers.”	448.20243064624765
“Monseigneur is correctly informed,” said D’Artagnan.	319.9682007171529
“Since that time many things have happened to you. You were walking one	460.04171855972186
day behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had	341.1774548422318
been elsewhere. Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters	480.6376382683748
of Forges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours. That is	344.5949882087314
all very simple: you had business in England.”	324.59441420229547
“Monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, quite confused, “I went—”	438.73610246662804
“Hunting at Windsor, or elsewhere—that concerns nobody. I know, because	407.2361705094233
it is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by	457.148991184852
an august personage, and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the	406.1859372141759
souvenir she gave you.”	473.23482640988664
D’Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen’s diamond, which he wore, and	413.30176534407224
quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late.	312.49511941696767
“The day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,” resumed the	437.0399954813735
cardinal. “He went to desire you to come to the palace. You have not	399.2299235257693
returned that visit, and you were wrong.”	366.65853327378966
“Monseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.”	346.70744149453196
“How could that be, monsieur? Could you incur my displeasure by having	469.6542468757398
followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and	358.3078772226625
courage than another would have done? It is the people who do not obey	316.8164516988347
that I punish, and not those who, like you, obey—but too well. As a	321.0243264146837
proof, remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come	335.30171937729693
to me, and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very	300.58260603100416
night.”	368.0252127798961
That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme. Bonacieux took	428.60819626431646
place. D’Artagnan trembled; and he likewise recollected that during the	310.18089704548254
past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him, without doubt	444.990145253838
carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance.	368.7831334263989
“In short,” continued the cardinal, “as I have heard nothing of you for	398.34149293585443
some time past, I wished to know what you were doing. Besides, you owe	307.31430365507754
me some thanks. You must yourself have remarked how much you have been	417.7755559144091
considered in all the circumstances.”	326.71142502935305
D’Artagnan bowed with respect.	329.0115531173847
“That,” continued the cardinal, “arose not only from a feeling of	323.940830116652
natural equity, but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect	384.85286511264115
to you.”	480.4509593473874
D’Artagnan became more and more astonished.	473.29100205618187
“I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first	320.42879230065273
invitation; but you did not come. Fortunately, nothing is lost by this	352.12411280392627
delay, and you are now about to hear it. Sit down there, before me,	453.227328066769
D’Artagnan; you are gentleman enough not to listen standing.” And the	485.65510666605394
cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man, who was	383.11603356339026
so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from	438.43357094840405
his interlocutor before he obeyed.	380.0063421915998
“You are brave, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” continued his Eminence; “you are	476.45238267312857
prudent, which is still better. I like men of head and heart. Don’t be	414.174725392284
afraid,” said he, smiling. “By men of heart I mean men of courage. But	364.1817455813318
young as you are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have	394.6844159637868
powerful enemies; if you do not take great heed, they will destroy	301.00870243461077
you.”	380.9044030110469
“Alas, monseigneur!” replied the young man, “very easily, no doubt, for	308.686049404207
they are strong and well supported, while I am alone.”	476.82280449555765
“Yes, that’s true; but alone as you are, you have done much already,	358.46864880376705
and will do still more, I don’t doubt. Yet you have need, I believe, to	331.9558671609092
be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken; for, if I	406.16079309586695
mistake not, you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your	387.6849164790426
fortune.”	320.1864759212924
“I am at the age of extravagant hopes, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan.	382.7989501485806
“There are no extravagant hopes but for fools, monsieur, and you are a	353.23151336113716
man of understanding. Now, what would you say to an ensign’s commission	427.1643621760903
in my Guards, and a company after the campaign?”	401.6415527027509
“Ah, monseigneur.”	384.67373537107915
“You accept it, do you not?”	407.8950879982922
“Monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, with an embarrassed air.	454.67396463136697
“How? You refuse?” cried the cardinal, with astonishment.	448.1440092777386
“I am in his Majesty’s Guards, monseigneur, and I have no reason to be	345.12202176664005
dissatisfied.”	345.85071290955443
“But it appears to me that my Guards—mine—are also his Majesty’s	327.65941195084497
Guards; and whoever serves in a French corps serves the king.”	314.4652607525035
“Monseigneur, your Eminence has ill understood my words.”	346.96742747441095
“You want a pretext, do you not? I comprehend. Well, you have this	350.14924365676
excuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I	308.02550321629707
offer you—so much for the world. As regards yourself, the need of	427.84575560348503
protection; for it is fit you should know, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that I	336.5507257208182
have received heavy and serious complaints against you. You do not	442.4543402798721
consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king’s service.”	461.9439185128977
D’Artagnan colored.	396.0893299918039
“In fact,” said the cardinal, placing his hand upon a bundle of papers,	352.1437986285605
“I have here a whole pile which concerns you. I know you to be a man of	314.0437616965113
resolution; and your services, well directed, instead of leading you to	447.9418792045409
ill, might be very advantageous to you. Come; reflect, and decide.”	391.8903022016196
“Your goodness confounds me, monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and I	327.2403559535077
am conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean	304.2370142617945
as an earthworm; but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely—”	305.1532481000687
D’Artagnan paused.	345.52096996469476
“Yes; speak.”	351.99857731231594
“Then, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king’s	399.30856908752804
Musketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies	410.00458827271314
are in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill	423.9490522777472
received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur	452.79986807136
offers me.”	357.90791750498164
“Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made	406.56881192195
you an offer equal to your value?” asked the cardinal, with a smile of	359.34004378436646
disdain.	323.7070438080705
“Monseigneur, your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me; and on	312.9318604329587
the contrary, I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness.	489.1563580463047
The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed, monseigneur. I shall	469.7221340065485
serve under the eye of your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to	324.84677619016674
conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention,	293.3858396782774
then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify	380.635754746368
the protection with which you honor me. Everything is best in its time,	456.5224666213134
monseigneur. Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of _giving_	425.2197412536495
myself; at present I shall appear to sell myself.”	411.9156111430347
“That is to say, you refuse to serve me, monsieur,” said the cardinal,	337.5213638068444
with a tone of vexation, through which, however, might be seen a sort	387.5945624136082
of esteem; “remain free, then, and guard your hatreds and your	477.5840519990862
sympathies.”	321.6165039346656
“Monseigneur—”	409.00968376739274
“Well, well,” said the cardinal, “I don’t wish you any ill; but you	379.6791337908327
must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense	326.41972292325164
our friends. We owe nothing to our enemies; and let me give you a piece	384.56751501957774
of advice; take care of yourself, Monsieur d’Artagnan, for from the	310.2035670787328
moment I withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an _obolus_	423.6286951086289
for your life.”	406.8853446228815
“I will try to do so, monseigneur,” replied the Gascon, with a noble	424.87635243946596
confidence.	440.8137801461297
“Remember at a later period and at a certain moment, if any mischance	300.5158627655406
should happen to you,” said Richelieu, significantly, “that it was I	383.41949004251296
who came to seek you, and that I did all in my power to prevent this	419.56747615674254
misfortune befalling you.”	377.01971560568734
“I shall entertain, whatever may happen,” said D’Artagnan, placing his	297.8419124688089
hand upon his breast and bowing, “an eternal gratitude toward your	378.2939267953586
Eminence for that which you now do for me.”	327.28523135647464
“Well, let it be, then, as you have said, Monsieur d’Artagnan; we shall	304.1290526984318
see each other again after the campaign. I will have my eye upon you,	427.95620629063615
for I shall be there,” replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger	350.74140954019117
to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, “and on our return,	293.2893557307697
well—we will settle our account!”	417.3855822996296
“Ah, monseigneur,” cried D’Artagnan, “spare me the weight of your	387.15431668438464
displeasure. Remain neutral monseigneur, if you find that I act as	491.3676560786007
becomes a gallant man.”	448.4594411854198
“Young man,” said Richelieu, “if I shall be able to say to you at	315.24773693338045
another time what I have said to you today, I promise you to do so.”	349.7670811891604
This last expression of Richelieu’s conveyed a terrible doubt; it	476.4245731422986
alarmed D’Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a	433.14143319288894
warning. The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some	373.6966191509957
misfortune which threatened him. He opened his mouth to reply, but with	406.14277175389304
a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.	350.5435369882042
D’Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and	460.46463111086143
he felt inclined to return. Then the noble and severe countenance of	407.85054679254597
Athos crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which	437.7686779837342
he required, Athos would no more give him his hand—Athos would renounce	381.5006307360796
him.	317.66398990610645
It was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a	428.14905197803057
truly great character on all that surrounds it.	311.68805092234953
D’Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and	314.3073803808782
found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and	423.12520073198147
beginning to grow uneasy. With a word, D’Artagnan reassured them; and	442.9818955116956
Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep	368.35520020434086
guard longer, as his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.	476.39894984808114
Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause	410.4759323966947
of the strange interview; but D’Artagnan confined himself to telling	432.3608689127507
them that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter	405.2267249839292
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.	347.7380899481357
“And you were right,” cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice.	430.7199141411015
Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they	402.80933999621317
were alone he said, “You have done that which you ought to have done,	379.375013899216
D’Artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.”	416.6062029382916
D’Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of	381.1336053970865
his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.	320.04335410576385
The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure.	396.6320433600132
D’Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Tréville. At that time it was	439.2076880951116
believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be	438.7970313979547
but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and	305.1432552128343
proposing to set out the day after. M. de Tréville contented himself	414.135241950896
with asking D’Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but D’Artagnan	361.38318717153834
answered that he was supplied with all he wanted.	443.85935510978186
That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M.	437.42289519583454
Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Tréville who had been	441.96046133241737
accustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when	349.06207082667214
it pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat	372.6381186970729
riotous, as may be imagined. In such cases extreme preoccupation is	344.0287982054566
only to be combated by extreme carelessness.	445.33676359901006
At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated; the	465.1267307627945
Musketeers hastening to the hôtel of M. de Tréville, the Guards to that	450.39569489190905
of M. Dessessart. Each of the captains then led his company to the	491.4851569085607
Louvre, where the king held his review.	423.60743826849733
The king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little from his	467.7370068625995
usual lofty bearing. In fact, the evening before, a fever had seized	415.2560111092786
him in the midst of the Parliament, while he was holding his Bed of	458.7058227798767
Justice. He had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same	486.09229836977653
evening; and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to	405.92380053899467
him, he persisted in having the review, hoping by setting it at	362.28189061526416
defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him.	351.4200114072057
The review over, the Guards set forward alone on their march, the	467.8654480055109
Musketeers waiting for the king, which allowed Porthos time to go and	395.00305947296215
take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours.	412.7214384734484
The procurator’s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	470.8810616161556
horse. She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made	483.278345361099
him a sign to dismount and come to her. Porthos was magnificent; his	428.8913473599686
spurs jingled, his cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against	481.3551442867848
his ample limbs. This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh,	464.317155422072
such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.	339.5738995267168
The Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little gray eyes	400.98185642196546
sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new. Nevertheless,	484.5140027076647
one thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody	304.874525737521
that the campaign would be a severe one. He whispered a hope to himself	476.4871291904935
that this beloved relative might be killed in the field.	396.0362977166691
Porthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him farewell. M.	481.7108545392548
Coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities. As to Mme. Coquenard,	421.19963490796306
she could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken	429.5392012020217
from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her	303.5744555374937
relatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with	466.97181644474165
her husband.	414.0038731320909
But the real adieux were made in Mme. Coquenard’s chamber; they were	337.4534662558461
heartrending.	351.11106372584123
As long as the procurator’s wife could follow him with her eyes, she	352.06665052970277
waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to	475.54285118494306
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. Porthos	450.44267737373025
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such	394.419512602282
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his	332.96264936845637
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.	361.36691015256883
On his part Aramis wrote a long letter. To whom? Nobody knew. Kitty,	307.56544106287726
who was to set out that evening for Tours, was waiting in the next	394.0244197535083
chamber.	380.73336475345724
Athos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine.	356.80779630881574
In the meantime D’Artagnan was defiling with his company. Arriving at	295.58600011177117
the Faubourg St. Antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the	339.5782969325388
Bastille; but as it was the Bastille alone he looked at, he did not	395.8976417990032
observe Milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated	308.01708238777854
him with her finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the	484.7997839875435
ranks to take notice of him. To a look of interrogation which they	355.10209291885576
made, Milady replied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there	297.03877105645495
could be no mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her	336.86382124624873
horse and disappeared.	359.04520953456586
The two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St.	429.3802394286988
Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without	469.2579177804611
livery had waiting for them.	415.9556874824938
Chapter XLI.	433.4671796084395
THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE	395.29735892796685
The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the	366.8837362665425
reign of Louis XIII., and one of the great military enterprises of the	350.59416562846246
cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should	415.3069866330695
say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege	386.70723037990695
are connected in too important a manner with the story we have	453.56762952214956
undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence.	423.2507424250549
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	393.30129403134544
extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private	302.2081874181178
plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the	359.6826793347879
others.	488.3459867179462
Of the important cities given up by Henry IV. to the Huguenots as places	458.90812991755894
of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary,	381.2750762386074
therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism—a dangerous leaven	371.98315515479084
with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly	454.0829666607027
mingling.	397.7204224404463
Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all	416.93985288513625
nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first	381.07637540727154
summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves	408.5949287126793
like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts	433.71721376751475
of Europe.	332.8836224006093
La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the	318.5070335869293
other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and	388.94190424017864
ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open	295.29690013803787
to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy,	485.8958984295466
the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise.	306.69930143531036
Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic—Protestant	387.4895462331398
by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost;	428.6368366589998
Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart—in	463.625701590946
short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La	331.2194466333791
Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant	470.361834869896
nobles like himself, “You will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools	427.2567629135326
enough to take La Rochelle.”	441.34328575355477
And Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of Ré presaged to	293.3568343787146
him the dragonnades of the Cévennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the	313.51015783831383
preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.	383.8858918024959
We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and	390.51376849013513
simplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced	411.00400249650056
to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival.	462.990357278794
Richelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a	488.41879343896943
simple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound	341.37165641177774
passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her?	356.0951913661517
That we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the	490.7326979106153
anterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage	419.35119344701616
over him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the	487.9176174389586
diamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers	473.2606745170176
and the courage and conduct of D’Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.	405.21205053145854
It was, then, Richelieu’s object, not only to get rid of an enemy of	476.24837231271033
France, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be	473.3257750187621
grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his	343.0915550840264
hand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom.	386.9764497151243
Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that	378.54049731835244
in triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham—in short, that	372.6939413655245
in humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham	328.2811409524309
in the eyes of the queen.	420.10204253643394
On his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England,	298.32743309975325
was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham	393.27526195403175
also was pursuing a private vengeance. Buckingham could not under any	300.84695362695265
pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter	447.14767057780034
it as a conqueror.	436.8608622450872
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most	353.44986962186135
powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was	441.90660435004065
simply a kind look from Anne of Austria.	379.12244203846967
The first advantage had been gained by Buckingham. Arriving	451.8738750487329
unexpectedly in sight of the Isle of Ré with ninety vessels and nearly	349.1124759844032
twenty thousand men, he had surprised the Comte de Toiras, who	390.9559055725465
commanded for the king in the Isle, and he had, after a bloody	363.0043811841165
conflict, effected his landing.	433.7979763602941
Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de	424.0479395934919
Chantal; that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen	425.97691110504377
months old, and that this little girl was afterward Mme. de Sévigné.	361.1048136947422
The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his	397.84125242524084
garrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of	449.4268142130145
La Prée.	312.04068081766985
This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the	420.59137358568853
king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which	469.8797849204136
was determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations,	457.67603120471387
and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the	456.59982105074505
theater of war. It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our	392.0548235669147
friend D’Artagnan formed a part.	337.5751252326359
The king, as we have said, was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice	439.6894095843821
had been held; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the	336.81034104990795
twenty-eighth of June, he felt himself attacked by fever. He was,	348.05546941547163
notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more	378.5243312037112
serious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy.	292.67603727756943
Now, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted. It followed that	463.87254140037646
D’Artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards, found	442.45712186107903
himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends—Athos,	402.58829045912455
Porthos, and Aramis. This separation, which was no more than an	318.21946192015804
unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious	478.0406294656245
uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was	443.01567292233324
surrounded.	430.816724772385
He, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before La	379.9832901372099
Rochelle, on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627.	354.9480871777936
Everything was in the same state. The Duke of Buckingham and his	481.70087821305935
English, masters of the Isle of Ré, continued to besiege, but without	440.102341765805
success, the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée; and	442.9381965016554
hostilities with La Rochelle had commenced, two or three days before,	326.0521460573732
about a fort which the Duc d’Angoulême had caused to be constructed	429.62577845148144
near the city.	463.33780999047246
The Guards, under the command of M. Dessessart, took up their quarters	392.4946733895392
at the Minimes; but, as we know, D’Artagnan, possessed with ambition to	330.73675177294126
enter the Musketeers, had formed but few friendships among his	307.8764826815103
comrades, and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own	371.98315923641667
reflections.	426.7576596165217
His reflections were not very cheerful. From the time of his arrival in	355.3220382431512
Paris, he had been mixed up with public affairs; but his own private	375.0939284497101
affairs had made no great progress, either in love or fortune. As to	487.3686984174807
love, the only woman he could have loved was Mme. Bonacieux; and Mme.	305.41787676383774
Bonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had	406.650726260656
become of her. As to fortune, he had made—he, humble as he was—an enemy	376.21764831948076
of the cardinal; that is to say, of a man before whom trembled the	364.05840892354854
greatest men of the kingdom, beginning with the king.	369.25637776117907
That man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so. For a	311.0265189892508
mind so perspicuous as that of D’Artagnan, this indulgence was a light	470.8410555333363
by which he caught a glimpse of a better future.	389.8098996171557
Then he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought;	426.6960602368314
but nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised. This enemy	427.4676560384038
was Milady.	368.65797339124407
In exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will	425.14126874112924
of the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an	450.29669615210616
additional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known,	364.2814898431347
protected badly—as witness Chalais and Mme. Bonacieux.	477.1503419598256
What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond, worth five or	443.6711411692613
six thousand livres, which he wore on his finger; and even this	356.3571218836124
diamond—supposing that D’Artagnan, in his projects of ambition, wished	423.8245132143805
to keep it, to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the	383.9086936786392
queen—had not in the meanwhile, since he could not part with it, more	332.6196282375482
value than the gravel he trod under his feet.	427.1440685637555
We say the gravel he trod under his feet, for D’Artagnan made these	463.789332164922
reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which	328.0347586184012
led from the camp to the village of Angoutin. Now, these reflections	435.42711755866134
had led him further than he intended, and the day was beginning to	404.7493126385875
decline when, by the last ray of the setting sun, he thought he saw the	486.22749586572746
barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge.	422.30303673866763
D’Artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding. He comprehended	309.9569916088211
that the musket had not come there of itself, and that he who bore it	306.1446332680097
had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions.	315.687906298799
He determined, therefore, to direct his course as clear from it as he	415.8314761877739
could when, on the opposite side of the road, from behind a rock, he	313.5424664446645
perceived the extremity of another musket.	312.81841148517225
This was evidently an ambuscade.	485.7759234424972
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain	429.98512571692174
degree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon	318.6702581743535
as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw	297.59279205540537
himself upon the ground. At the same instant the gun was fired, and he	327.65900920196
heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head.	403.27294421966087
No time was to be lost. D’Artagnan sprang up with a bound, and at the	367.3059402982271
same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the	303.98405164384604
very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the	397.4752136138433
ground.	481.67330368045526
D’Artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous	444.3530452438414
death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a	471.4110916038435
single step. Besides, courage was out of the question here; D’Artagnan	388.32989099349766
had fallen into an ambush.	407.8563473434299
“If there is a third shot,” said he to himself, “I am a lost man.”	392.33068764485233
He immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp,	476.4381694235664
with the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for	383.67915398186904
their agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired,	298.58745009169945
having had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well	440.056917390486
aimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.	413.96320886506896
As he, however, had no other hat, he picked up this as he ran, and	329.2161248774147
arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath. He sat down	405.64532498449216
without saying a word to anybody, and began to reflect.	297.52765625322655
This event might have three causes:	471.21504619161254
The first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the	344.4625516709843
Rochellais, who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majesty’s Guards,	304.7617121588363
because it would be an enemy the less, and this enemy might have a	421.08658801369364
well-furnished purse in his pocket.	413.8433844756518
D’Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook	455.6093258988151
his head. The ball was not a musket ball—it was an arquebus ball. The	325.5617432401167
accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon	485.5831332390035
had been employed. This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as	391.38738675161886
the ball was not of the regular caliber.	348.8515767685124
This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal. It may be	436.73843491277466
observed that at the very moment when, thanks to the ray of the sun, he	489.1863115383487
perceived the gun barrel, he was thinking with astonishment on the	296.666205769979
forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him.	360.68575960234034
But D’Artagnan again shook his head. For people toward whom he had but	442.57700790687886
to put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means.	454.846866612731
It might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.	330.0382877267876
He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins; he	415.71655107498304
had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything.	382.61241716130826
“Ah, my poor friends!” murmured D’Artagnan; “where are you? And that	327.56683034381115
you should fail me!”	292.0683492575741
D’Artagnan passed a very bad night. Three or four times he started up,	433.65442784279946
imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of	419.9721489477049
stabbing him. Nevertheless, day dawned without darkness having brought	336.8018406630639
any accident.	429.2311168141669
But D’Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not	299.10898141977697
relinquished.	438.69102694437044
D’Artagnan remained all day in his quarters, assigning as a reason to	449.24151961332063
himself that the weather was bad.	339.74375095013505
At nine o’clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms. The Duc	452.0520398325116
d’Orléans visited the posts. The guards were under arms, and D’Artagnan	402.4515782142872
took his place in the midst of his comrades.	489.31905952503837
Monsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior	405.76471971354545
officers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart,	447.4578308812488
captain of the Guards, as well as the others.	405.5062913873524
At the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to D’Artagnan that M.	385.1474162888528
Dessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture	459.8933810553579
on the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this	300.11849739174176
gesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive	431.63599344856084
orders.	301.01789871547226
“Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous	390.9446182855917
mission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it;	325.41710120906015
and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in	371.18620940860785
readiness.”	487.8876852010046
“Thanks, my captain!” replied D’Artagnan, who wished for nothing better	419.44470058482574
than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the	342.56712438325826
lieutenant general.	328.4728572635591
In fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night, and had	424.0653014404655
retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two	318.3182514132901
days before. The matter was to ascertain, by reconnoitering, how the	354.1816655055908
enemy guarded this bastion.	354.6512043675883
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice, and said, “I	461.019118382657
want for this mission three or four volunteers, led by a man who can be	346.7931778149504
depended upon.”	457.47091031471007
“As to the man to be depended upon, I have him under my hand,	447.2834885341804
monsieur,” said M. Dessessart, pointing to D’Artagnan; “and as to the	468.0355786204693
four or five volunteers, Monsieur has but to make his intentions known,	488.77850052258617
and the men will not be wanting.”	385.9806025706431
“Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me!” said	296.08525478913236
D’Artagnan, raising his sword.	462.46664298893734
Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward, and two	371.50320143482793
other soldiers having joined them, the number was deemed sufficient.	444.08132417152876
D’Artagnan declined all others, being unwilling to take the first	339.66390235816965
chance from those who had the priority.	426.7282232000722
It was not known whether, after the taking of the bastion, the	389.63687823383714
Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it; the object then	348.7460965243916
was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports.	333.5941419436873
D’Artagnan set out with his four companions, and followed the trench;	326.2905822453614
the two Guards marched abreast with him, and the two soldiers followed	379.2907472116658
behind.	326.42050185782443
They arrived thus, screened by the lining of the trench, till they came	407.65865349059266
within a hundred paces of the bastion. There, on turning round,	316.3035155382326
D’Artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared.	420.2625584711485
He thought that, beginning to be afraid, they had stayed behind, and he	398.89474162262604
continued to advance.	488.4880583512227
At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about	407.83210532237564
sixty paces of the bastion. They saw no one, and the bastion seemed	473.0384486998737
abandoned.	427.5341771338068
The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they	338.9235703760211
should proceed any further, when all at once a circle of smoke	316.0124523073833
enveloped the giant of stone, and a dozen balls came whistling around	484.53711777824503
D’Artagnan and his companions.	346.2816108283005
They knew all they wished to know; the bastion was guarded. A longer	350.08091356801754
stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence.	469.22210241536925
D’Artagnan and his two companions turned their backs, and commenced a	465.0868925642055
retreat which resembled a flight.	316.8251355401182
On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a	364.70807218807596
rampart, one of the Guardsmen fell. A ball had passed through his	307.9750392678859
breast. The other, who was safe and sound, continued his way toward the	443.85469498302473
camp.	439.0951616606974
D’Artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus, and stooped	426.6498109175305
to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines; but at this moment	420.21596724321097
two shots were fired. One ball struck the head of the already-wounded	373.2753586312197
guard, and the other flattened itself against a rock, after having	407.2486461348008
passed within two inches of D’Artagnan.	355.96932031403236
The young man turned quickly round, for this attack could not have come	345.0913942075538
from the bastion, which was hidden by the angle of the trench. The idea	461.37445786965986
of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind, and	424.0717090653993
with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before. He	382.3947713574352
resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal, and fell upon the	343.53543679648266
body of his comrade as if he were dead.	324.8925648544116
He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty	346.1219561125896
paces of him; they were the heads of the two soldiers. D’Artagnan had	376.73945830458194
not been deceived; these two men had only followed for the purpose of	349.985841763233
assassinating him, hoping that the young man’s death would be placed to	410.8309559118877
the account of the enemy.	474.3877350416841
As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime, they came	355.23540860966637
up to him with the purpose of making sure. Fortunately, deceived by	376.028825565848
D’Artagnan’s trick, they neglected to reload their guns.	313.27044097932327
When they were within ten paces of him, D’Artagnan, who in falling had	385.768650938046
taken care not to let go his sword, sprang up close to them.	320.1719356599375
The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without	369.0242308107048
having killed their man, they should be accused by him; therefore their	477.9777341301914
first idea was to join the enemy. One of them took his gun by the	326.4782905840909
barrel, and used it as he would a club. He aimed a terrible blow at	308.0714537857979
D’Artagnan, who avoided it by springing to one side; but by this	442.8166352912098
movement he left a passage free to the bandit, who darted off toward	393.16290607722357
the bastion. As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of	415.4763299561604
the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them, they fired upon	468.43224166281084
him, and he fell, struck by a ball which broke his shoulder.	373.35338954839756
Meantime D’Artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier,	357.60469333973793
attacking him with his sword. The conflict was not long; the wretch had	300.2419701245526
nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus. The sword	312.83120020640104
of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now-useless weapon,	411.8374786592599
and passed through the thigh of the assassin, who fell.	475.4776288321724
D’Artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat.	385.3335402849365
“Oh, do not kill me!” cried the bandit. “Pardon, pardon, my officer,	342.02896193324284
and I will tell you all.”	318.4294502538823
“Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?”	386.6978774703733
asked the young man, withholding his arm.	314.41372837321984
“Yes; if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty, as you	469.1767973768675
are, and who may hope for everything, being handsome and brave, as you	491.5142719619136
are.”	333.8460005144775
“Wretch,” cried D’Artagnan, “speak quickly! Who employed you to	448.0348523385118
assassinate me?”	439.1021175007297
“A woman whom I don’t know, but who is called Milady.”	397.3118760860227
“But if you don’t know this woman, how do you know her name?”	371.8531376323553
“My comrade knows her, and called her so. It was with him she agreed,	403.33205765744253
and not with me; he even has in his pocket a letter from that person,	464.73584109326873
who attaches great importance to you, as I have heard him say.”	330.534190435699
“But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?”	393.5081345205365
“He proposed to me to undertake it with him, and I agreed.”	380.0113555265515
“And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?”	294.47463426365977
“A hundred louis.”	407.31987217886984
“Well, come!” said the young man, laughing, “she thinks I am worth	383.2563050938183
something. A hundred louis? Well, that was a temptation for two	386.77422739979016
wretches like you. I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my	357.5641269207699
pardon; but upon one condition.”	481.0590950220014
“What is that?” said the soldier, uneasy at perceiving that all was not	318.7727789226772
over.	382.8117230830227
“That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	433.37611621365477
pocket.”	470.1989753247017
“But,” cried the bandit, “that is only another way of killing me. How	379.6830040964462
can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?”	339.5917576268802
“You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear	422.9810836049783
you shall die by my hand.”	420.9510293773146
“Pardon, monsieur; pity! In the name of that young lady you love, and	373.5524837029716
whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!” cried the bandit,	398.8774036496325
throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand—for he began	434.22152641078617
to lose his strength with his blood.	310.4042973680868
“And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I	350.5011531550998
believed that woman dead?” asked D’Artagnan.	392.7235718791393
“By that letter which my comrade has in his pocket.”	398.0916519967862
“You see, then,” said D’Artagnan, “that I must have that letter. So no	319.7012059914516
more delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance	405.1334912699057
to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you,	450.8823114326552
I swear by my faith as an honest man—” and at these words D’Artagnan	427.5799859965978
made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up.	463.812041841265
“Stop, stop!” cried he, regaining strength by force of terror. “I will	341.53699318048723
go—I will go!”	456.2925023137379
D’Artagnan took the soldier’s arquebus, made him go on before him, and	357.646822088815
urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword.	297.61032255030614
It was a frightful thing to see this wretch, leaving a long track of	448.6724534725414
blood on the ground he passed over, pale with approaching death, trying	387.28147463583804
to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice,	478.98202764230575
which lay twenty paces from him.	301.472237872065
Terror was so strongly painted on his face, covered with a cold sweat,	334.5276085236107
that D’Artagnan took pity on him, and casting upon him a look of	377.1905817989201
contempt, “Stop,” said he, “I will show you the difference between a	425.4506964829654
man of courage and such a coward as you. Stay where you are; I will go	428.6021929970744
myself.”	371.5070723930718
And with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements of	445.82313693336323
the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground,	396.1966887309071
D’Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier.	461.87982541735846
There were two means of gaining his object—to search him on the spot,	327.04675154371984
or to carry him away, making a buckler of his body, and search him in	482.5879920264201
the trench.	298.86101562344
D’Artagnan preferred the second means, and lifted the assassin onto his	351.8198278928877
shoulders at the moment the enemy fired.	363.15703289045206
A slight shock, the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the	390.36440287466075
flesh, a last cry, a convulsion of agony, proved to D’Artagnan that the	327.39401480718675
would-be assassin had saved his life.	419.44579313080396
D’Artagnan regained the trench, and threw the corpse beside the wounded	481.0092412804337
man, who was as pale as death.	474.47335491503975
Then he began to search. A leather pocketbook, a purse, in which was	327.3216781787559
evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received, with a dice	423.4865557008357
box and dice, completed the possessions of the dead man.	442.49203166295104
He left the box and dice where they fell, threw the purse to the	475.2205646664131
wounded man, and eagerly opened the pocketbook.	384.8937123164483
Among some unimportant papers he found the following letter, that which	468.15127918105645
he had sought at the risk of his life:	485.949476326667
“Since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in	369.4496245605728
the convent, which you should never have allowed her to reach, try, at	431.02227526798686
least, not to miss the man. If you do, you know that my hand stretches	421.8962926935881
far, and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have	479.3007911747565
from me.”	360.7432507412898
No signature. Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady. He	312.33165899976683
consequently kept it as a piece of evidence, and being in safety behind	463.0611368908759
the angle of the trench, he began to interrogate the wounded man. He	377.5648479465717
confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade—the same who was	409.44659842340366
killed—to carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the	335.46850825941954
Barrière de La Villette; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret, they	365.1541226495781
had missed the carriage by ten minutes.	434.3690419513139
“But what were you to do with that woman?” asked D’Artagnan, with	457.4752520275169
anguish.	490.60037661637614
“We were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the Place Royale,” said the	374.55968410028856
wounded man.	454.7857448430534
“Yes, yes!” murmured D’Artagnan; “that’s the place—Milady’s own	394.97198809890017
residence!”	431.60751229761104
Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for	348.61615507853526
vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him, as well as all who loved	440.6368513884105
him, and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court,	314.1874244952281
since she had discovered all. There could be no doubt she owed this	292.7660363852726
information to the cardinal.	478.4627473848381
But amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the	378.9751018487672
queen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme. Bonacieux was	415.00291897741334
explaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison;	482.8296612678257
and the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage	348.45999752464115
along the road of Chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.	428.9451267273363
Then also, as Athos had predicted, it became possible to find Mme.	315.6550967068995
Bonacieux, and a convent was not impregnable.	367.5989201724765
This idea completely restored clemency to his heart. He turned toward	454.93495975115354
the wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various	370.98923238255435
expressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said,	402.35476984601576
“Come, I will not abandon you thus. Lean upon me, and let us return to	300.781930180928
the camp.”	479.6864318226296
“Yes,” said the man, who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity,	433.60671141672935
“but is it not to have me hanged?”	423.2060895372361
“You have my word,” said he; “for the second time I give you your	372.93259879565755
life.”	463.1217169000297
The wounded man sank upon his knees, to again kiss the feet of his	438.9112358035769
preserver; but D’Artagnan, who had no longer a motive for staying so	315.4791590202434
near the enemy, abridged the testimonials of his gratitude.	444.5346591462487
The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the	374.71031891317176
death of his four companions. They were therefore much astonished and	359.70554720489315
delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe	382.48195288699253
and sound.	447.07432421755107
D’Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_	434.7047467938198
which he improvised. He described the death of the other soldier, and	365.25985944950963
the perils they had encountered. This recital was for him the occasion	361.6987405184565
of veritable triumph. The whole army talked of this expedition for a	489.56227502082334
day, and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it. Besides this, as	322.48708354366397
every great action bears its recompense with it, the brave exploit of	356.2950034813597
D’Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost.	330.49709706733836
In fact, D’Artagnan believed that he might be tranquil, as one of his	379.4912507690457
two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests.	469.75856934201795
This tranquillity proved one thing—that D’Artagnan did not yet know	294.9756183071887
Milady.	451.23553613741
Chapter XLII.	421.5088981759971
THE ANJOU WINE	372.3261569123722
After the most disheartening news of the king’s health, a report of his	428.79623170754405
convalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious	459.64946655383835
to be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could	488.46479812633925
mount a horse he would set forward.	304.76380509248133
Meantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might	472.5060138059041
expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d’Angoulême, by	337.1809504749118
Bassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but	360.0066474554757
little, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any	336.2277349980068
great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Ré, where they	473.59142176697696
still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée, as on	294.61260743635165
their side the French were besieging La Rochelle.	479.9397543543263
D’Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always	488.9144935826893
happens after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have	483.1183527536866
vanished. He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any	364.24427436177996
tidings from his friends.	354.8908976265504
But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything	306.7740306914193
was explained to him by this letter, dated from Villeroy:	381.46626243120016
M. D’ARTAGNAN, MM. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, after having had an	455.161688992049
entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much, created	463.74247615348634
such a disturbance that the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has	446.2918830541002
ordered them to be confined for some days; but I accomplish the order	409.7129453405737
they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou	469.92351781051775
wine, with which they are much pleased. They are desirous that you	297.6585900494721
should drink to their health in their favorite wine. I have done this,	446.14226864170746
and am, monsieur, with great respect,	366.16164782661235
Your very humble and obedient servant,	378.494077519202
GODEAU, _Purveyor of the Musketeers_	359.27443108715863
“That’s all well!” cried D’Artagnan. “They think of me in their	339.67725576797676
pleasures, as I thought of them in my troubles. Well, I will certainly	312.1835282957327
drink to their health with all my heart, but I will not drink alone.”	382.16934213153894
And D’Artagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed	405.97989068598054
greater intimacy than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with him	351.3227568390918
this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from	479.6740251865139
Villeroy.	352.86682909751266
One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the	453.9602746653479
next, so the meeting was fixed for the day after that.	377.8137539348837
D’Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the	303.8411383420031
refreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care	428.459082466757
should be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner	344.87892304128985
was fixed for midday D’Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to	474.6664818698807
assist in preparing everything for the entertainment.	466.5822012141695
Planchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord,	399.7581437633402
thought he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this	442.47128228937083
view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master’s	404.27686088955795
guests, named Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill	451.8264450667943
D’Artagnan and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service	333.0916231086817
of D’Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after D’Artagnan had saved his	345.1448957133108
life.	294.8199642446791
The hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their	369.6311326896924
places, and the dishes were arranged on the table. Planchet waited,	444.2546547415517
towel on arm; Fourreau uncorked the bottles; and Brisemont, which was	312.0159734866728
the name of the convalescent, poured the wine, which was a little	487.7930769125393
shaken by its journey, carefully into decanters. Of this wine, the	380.06004935067085
first bottle being a little thick at the bottom, Brisemont poured the	340.2153505816615
lees into a glass, and D’Artagnan desired him to drink it, for the poor	428.2622046349037
devil had not yet recovered his strength.	377.25397135950953
The guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of	480.2645730192519
wine to their lips, when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis	466.3926333687557
and Fort Neuf. The Guardsmen, imagining this to be caused by some	388.4459950506555
unexpected attack, either of the besieged or the English, sprang to	385.4544671206927
their swords. D’Artagnan, not less forward than they, did likewise, and	316.1873067962961
all ran out, in order to repair to their posts.	305.5836191532565
But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of	443.92702710054095
the cause of this noise. Cries of “Live the king! Live the cardinal!”	485.3919120849305
resounded on every side, and the drums were beaten in all directions.	431.54840247666493
In short, the king, impatient, as has been said, had come by forced	385.0842362768535
marches, and had that moment arrived with all his household and a	341.38677591035946
reinforcement of ten thousand troops. His Musketeers proceeded and	464.1185272299761
followed him. D’Artagnan, placed in line with his company, saluted with	304.0077923001642
an expressive gesture his three friends, whose eyes soon discovered	317.95487006179695
him, and M. de Tréville, who detected him at once.	418.60294216936245
The ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one	484.2602014281622
another’s arms.	419.0758794573105
“_Pardieu!_” cried D’Artagnan, “you could not have arrived in better	424.6035980633591
time; the dinner cannot have had time to get cold! Can it, gentlemen?”	436.7928071695761
added the young man, turning to the two Guards, whom he introduced to	477.76516837137063
his friends.	456.8683483553787
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “it appears we are feasting!”	343.29631883734623
“I hope,” said Aramis, “there are no women at your dinner.”	491.20060611948804
“Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?” asked Athos.	294.16188734566884
“Well, _pardieu!_ there is yours, my dear friend,” replied D’Artagnan.	329.50752436092847
“Our wine!” said Athos, astonished.	449.26701089275286
“Yes, that you sent me.”	454.77781130167784
“We sent you wine?”	448.25961385684604
“You know very well—the wine from the hills of Anjou.”	380.79848379438147
“Yes, I know what brand you are talking about.”	483.90242336321035
“The wine you prefer.”	367.3873870050143
“Well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content	452.70445040438517
yourselves with that.”	368.51127796885214
“And so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some Anjou	435.91870287396955
wine?” said Porthos.	370.694568027182
“Not exactly, it is the wine that was sent by your order.”	369.9842907486319
“On our account?” said the three Musketeers.	308.2577957334295
“Did you send this wine, Aramis?” said Athos.	314.72076371298806
“No; and you, Porthos?”	489.120755732947
“No; and you, Athos?”	424.7657882973901
“No!”	487.46486530082274
“If it was not you, it was your purveyor,” said D’Artagnan.	359.5589495064351
“Our purveyor!”	376.34050887503105
“Yes, your purveyor, Godeau—the purveyor of the Musketeers.”	450.8647367719392
“My faith! never mind where it comes from,” said Porthos, “let us taste	471.7522993811946
it, and if it is good, let us drink it.”	446.38715735382425
“No,” said Athos; “don’t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown	381.089946359204
source.”	408.2518992907327
“You are right, Athos,” said D’Artagnan. “Did none of you charge your	463.76467967785754
purveyor, Godeau, to send me some wine?”	321.58978963940064
“No! And yet you say he has sent you some as from us?”	396.85942985160113
“Here is his letter,” said D’Artagnan, and he presented the note to his	475.7418829495998
comrades.	478.58806605699107
“This is not his writing!” said Athos. “I am acquainted with it; before	428.0348058581378
we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment.”	425.8489431322886
“A false letter altogether,” said Porthos, “we have not been	325.2203597818237
disciplined.”	344.9600003290715
“D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, in a reproachful tone, “how could you	449.14329949294483
believe that we had made a disturbance?”	366.13489950410576
D’Artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.	339.4404534384631
“Thou alarmest me!” said Athos, who never used _thee_ and _thou_ but	475.87790654732413
upon very particular occasions, “what has happened?”	359.5542595302658
“Look you, my friends!” cried D’Artagnan, “a horrible suspicion crosses	427.99534503002434
my mind! Can this be another vengeance of that woman?”	471.41024366606257
It was now Athos who turned pale.	424.5283701794765
D’Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three Musketeers and	293.9486063359546
the two Guards following him.	415.33444400381444
The first object that met the eyes of D’Artagnan on entering the room	373.2820984973015
was Brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible	486.2952887403113
convulsions.	403.08668975780523
Planchet and Fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him	491.2653408243964
succor; but it was plain that all assistance was useless—all the	356.7125253744301
features of the dying man were distorted with agony.	293.26717832471627
“Ah!” cried he, on perceiving D’Artagnan, “ah! this is frightful! You	478.4686070357536
pretend to pardon me, and you poison me!”	448.2497030768931
“I!” cried D’Artagnan. “I, wretch? What do you say?”	491.163145638217
“I say that it was you who gave me the wine; I say that it was you who	376.7685211039758
desired me to drink it. I say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and	411.1624673973788
I say that it is horrible!”	458.5804173825643
“Do not think so, Brisemont,” said D’Artagnan; “do not think so. I	359.63112855148296
swear to you, I protest—”	389.5582886921534
“Oh, but God is above! God will punish you! My God, grant that he may	445.88202317006346
one day suffer what I suffer!”	463.4336257936533
“Upon the Gospel,” said D’Artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying	454.12755503042945
man, “I swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to	396.97573746187015
drink of it as you did.”	477.11172073371887
“I do not believe you,” cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible	343.1767853178997
tortures.	330.28956423088886
“Frightful! frightful!” murmured Athos, while Porthos broke the bottles	421.83570804469593
and Aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be	413.5913740169348
sent for.	433.7728105625794
“Oh, my friends,” said D’Artagnan, “you come once more to save my life,	442.34228960152564
not only mine but that of these gentlemen. Gentlemen,” continued he,	387.268357451763
addressing the Guardsmen, “I request you will be silent with regard to	483.9713280582503
this adventure. Great personages may have had a hand in what you have	452.8679966952825
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us.”	306.3642861020848
“Ah, monsieur!” stammered Planchet, more dead than alive, “ah,	430.92737728731834
monsieur, what an escape I have had!”	293.7143839543858
“How, sirrah! you were going to drink my wine?”	457.59092096041445
“To the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small	342.0378853146536
glass of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called.”	319.21578370968234
“Alas!” said Fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, “I wanted to	463.3644873654265
get him out of the way that I might drink myself.”	436.15963929299255
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, addressing the Guardsmen, “you may easily	418.7280160851006
comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken	304.64648760238754
place; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I	393.18238491769205
beg of you.”	427.44642489859416
The two Guardsmen courteously accepted D’Artagnan’s excuses, and	384.2218430816142
perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.	337.0077924009317
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without	346.99122798920786
witnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly	490.5249375139086
expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.	451.49827106068574
“In the first place,” said Athos, “let us leave this chamber; the dead	450.4183610521104
are not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent	449.0101378487928
death.”	368.424234103659
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, “I commit the corpse of this poor devil to	436.8877116364623
your care. Let him be interred in holy ground. He committed a crime, it	434.1684619237003
is true; but he repented of it.”	340.553073903143
And the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau	459.76752894400306
the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont.	343.6329750348206
The host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and	441.6575843513725
some water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain. In a few	319.78417203048315
words, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation.	330.8205717898436
“Well,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “you see, my dear friend, that this	438.986703185694
is war to the death.”	334.84940816629916
Athos shook his head.	300.3576503704357
“Yes, yes,” replied he, “I perceive that plainly; but do you really	368.13360495788254
believe it is she?”	311.770338707326
“I am sure of it.”	335.34920255067726
“Nevertheless, I confess I still doubt.”	306.22465389717115
“But the _fleur-de-lis_ on her shoulder?”	417.5205824103629
“She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has	479.81438208418024
been branded in consequence.”	403.95180493693726
“Athos, she is your wife, I tell you,” repeated D’Artagnan; “only	366.44390423296653
reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.”	373.07530676042336
“Yes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so	381.36790011219557
effectually.”	310.92674534101064
It was D’Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn.	436.9582236049013
“But in either case, what is to be done?” said the young man.	405.72144731098126
“The fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally	399.89192689527204
over his head,” said Athos. “We must extricate ourselves from this	346.2387625221839
position.”	301.65556300564225
“But how?”	384.1540822027297
“Listen! You must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. Say	392.947675078465
to her: ‘Peace or war! My word as a gentleman never to say anything of	469.0194833131191
you, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath to	319.4680490871491
remain neutral with respect to me. If not, I will apply to the	413.81586862639693
chancellor, I will apply to the king, I will apply to the hangman, I	344.1245034894546
will move the courts against you, I will denounce you as branded, I	420.3868609411137
will bring you to trial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith	306.0752954173817
of a gentleman, I will kill you at the corner of some wall, as I would	403.563772209005
a mad dog.’”	343.14661400129546
“I like the means well enough,” said D’Artagnan, “but where and how to	308.27092059296285
meet with her?”	366.49587415924077
“Time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the	450.9445357788342
martingale of man. The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we	468.16214388859265
know how to wait.”	471.5163703940244
“Yes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners.”	474.8240653627913
“Bah!” said Athos. “God has preserved us hitherto, God will preserve us	386.38477997546863
still.”	321.56190631883703
“Yes, we. Besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot	412.71344256194556
to risk our lives; but _she_,” asked he, in an undertone.	462.16015431008015
“What she?” asked Athos.	367.06160370361295
“Constance.”	419.4945633392206
“Madame Bonacieux! Ah, that’s true!” said Athos. “My poor friend, I had	467.2689814297413
forgotten you were in love.”	377.4729790414282
“Well, but,” said Aramis, “have you not learned by the letter you found	355.03658565653075
on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? One may be very	442.5394248740419
comfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is	441.86180022251926
terminated, I promise you on my part—”	377.45547267187834
“Good,” cried Athos, “good! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your	442.89930763743087
views have a religious tendency.”	401.03664484588575
“I am only temporarily a Musketeer,” said Aramis, humbly.	356.40148925516735
“It is some time since we heard from his mistress,” said Athos, in a	320.6858324568321
low voice. “But take no notice; we know all about that.”	315.02873501513756
“Well,” said Porthos, “it appears to me that the means are very	332.0992176068013
simple.”	294.77877735265054
“What?” asked D’Artagnan.	467.40512297217253
“You say she is in a convent?” replied Porthos.	301.50552691441715
“Yes.”	388.3567777523452
“Very well. As soon as the siege is over, we’ll carry her off from that	316.945853575313
convent.”	344.516674378053
“But we must first learn what convent she is in.”	317.21512173189547
“That’s true,” said Porthos.	402.0789184579473
“But I think I have it,” said Athos. “Don’t you say, dear D’Artagnan,	484.1295172241915
that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?”	321.97038188806926
“I believe so, at least.”	477.588847904978
“In that case Porthos will assist us.”	353.9356548151306
“And how so, if you please?”	442.3091288050366
“Why, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. She must have a	352.35077610465885
long arm.”	342.03367046104665
“Hush!” said Porthos, placing a finger on his lips. “I believe her to	337.33736538053984
be a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter.”	476.030436991738
“Then,” said Aramis, “I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of	365.5283645789321
her.”	318.56101059018545
“You, Aramis?” cried the three friends. “You! And how?”	344.56313833530555
“By the queen’s almoner, to whom I am very intimately allied,” said	376.30133909896495
Aramis, coloring.	384.8182280183229
And on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest	445.8698413806321
repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.	328.6022886072684
D’Artagnan returned to less important affairs, and the three Musketeers	472.2113687607346
repaired to the king’s quarters, where they had to prepare their	297.77676751870155
lodging.	408.8414815021947
Chapter XLIII.	381.8216359767696
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT	459.4117332322779
Meanwhile the king, who, with more reason than the cardinal, showed his	472.486072495406
hatred for Buckingham, although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to	456.46103504300027
meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive	301.57622329690014
the English from the Isle of Ré, and afterward to press the siege of La	464.4411727937784
Rochelle; but notwithstanding his earnest wish, he was delayed by the	342.8039057356002
dissensions which broke out between MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg,	312.53550370705375
against the Duc d’Angoulême.	425.69937440822775
MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France, and claimed	335.0106582119272
their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king; but	417.86738843216705
the cardinal, who feared that Bassompierre, a Huguenot at heart, might	413.3420936463996
press but feebly the English and Rochellais, his brothers in religion,	295.81538011692817
supported the Duc d’Angoulême, whom the king, at his instigation, had	409.92208588455514
named lieutenant general. The result was that to prevent MM.	366.55259564135423
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command	405.1333178396511
had to be given to each. Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north	337.13020964853945
of the city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc d’Angoulême on the	329.5377899107252
east, from Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from	421.8990875435902
Perigny to Angoutin.	346.0545688670742
The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king	312.01932900701274
were sometimes at Estrée, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinal’s quarters	466.2473563264425
were upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house	389.46800644325276
without any entrenchment. So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the	462.7030984678752
king, the Duc d’Angoulême; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg.	465.45652419771284
As soon as this organization was established, they set about driving	394.4542363932235
the English from the Isle.	485.6970318541761
The juncture was favorable. The English, who require, above everything,	292.48447539529906
good living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad	382.99888286034303
biscuit, had many invalids in their camp. Still further, the sea, very	402.76538545236446
rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed	486.7389097932579
every day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of	364.27405655682907
l’Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with	381.4792130153895
the wrecks of pinnacles, _roberges_, and feluccas. The result was that	416.38068552897084
even if the king’s troops remained quietly in their camp, it was	338.5144933241511
evident that some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the	371.9192973615443
Isle from obstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege.	363.14678071714485
But as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in	442.69219815800716
the enemy’s camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be	292.75419254017015
best to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a	345.59895067502623
decisive action.	406.29055319866075
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the	482.49626483059126
contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected	315.9082971622448
with the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying	402.0208342966879
in two words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment	391.4535170360805
of the king and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed	406.40266174655096
foot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of	441.8202075185019
the Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of	382.61732063847614
battle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three	378.00804207495315
lieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen	408.4915299182446
of rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to	367.2386405737904
Paris by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the	468.8538609063137
arches of Notre Dame.	451.11511033472595
Te Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France.	477.0377688425076
The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at	478.37964782572135
least at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English.	378.3581495890929
But it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy	451.4819876028304
of the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was	319.3953605635215
obtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and	490.9153071667521
Lorraine. This league was directed against France.	302.4182677715279
Still further, in Buckingham’s lodging, which he had been forced to	336.689709571887
abandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which	322.0880043065679
confirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his	334.4634146915214
memoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the	328.9666074015148
queen.	407.2429040350214
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is	427.10749807001116
not a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the	489.2035934429834
vast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in	318.4327386853624
listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of	436.3914588214486
Europe.	300.6977016697038
The cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly	387.3515301398442
the hatred, of Buckingham. If the league which threatened France	412.8380069839628
triumphed, all his influence would be lost. Spanish policy and Austrian	422.5875704951158
policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre,	462.1150866891421
where they had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu—the French	334.61281982788586
minister, the national minister—would be ruined. The king, even while	400.8578838789565
obeying him like a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and	399.8042599753518
would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen.	422.7845424703782
He would then be lost, and France, perhaps, with him. All this must be	458.6306986747235
prepared against.	322.34589214107604
Courtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another,	442.8071717174256
day and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which	340.69386496879093
the cardinal had established his residence.	442.9942749988265
There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was	484.5575087192075
easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little	426.65024552562403
inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could	474.1996279623774
not entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened	468.6025064933212
hands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off.	329.4117711687764
There were also less agreeable visits—for two or three times reports	372.15710391433544
were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated.	491.0645185474408
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself	357.3816494709733
who set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted,	327.68497664584834
the right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything	376.2866378203015
ministers say, nor everything their enemies say.	464.2844342064142
These attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most	417.85753537949097
inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery, from making	420.5742618098953
nocturnal excursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc d’Angoulême	349.8050780781694
important orders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to	412.70196165680676
have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.	301.86378733010287
On their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,	403.184188510404
were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. This was the	336.3575615505254
more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of	398.0983989791169
M. de Tréville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent	448.7512735147791
after the closing of the camp.	360.87374866217067
Now, one evening when D’Artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able	413.1100422972407
to accompany them, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, mounted on their battle	351.13044825242525
steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their	346.2787700420008
pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the Red	374.7111359979574
Dovecot, which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to	317.4812993529686
Jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their	330.28783387173655
guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a	338.8925125445347
quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau, they fancied they	348.6441192273028
heard the sound of horses approaching them. They immediately all three	393.7878081572282
halted, closed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road. In an	327.7898883998976
instant, and as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a	392.5095023123387
turning of the road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in	358.14091055560095
their turn, appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their	405.49712149756124
route or go back. The hesitation created some suspicion in the three	468.2537660993132
friends, and Athos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried	314.19183538866196
in a firm voice, “Who goes there?”	482.17766627060075
“Who goes there, yourselves?” replied one of the horsemen.	446.89394206129043
“That is not an answer,” replied Athos. “Who goes there? Answer, or we	387.4423437102787
charge.”	484.5108566662201
“Beware of what you are about, gentlemen!” said a clear voice which	394.14454104974516
seemed accustomed to command.	361.0867378632936
“It is some superior officer making his night rounds,” said Athos.	365.7785828755196
“What do you wish, gentlemen?”	398.59569905956556
“Who are you?” said the same voice, in the same commanding tone.	367.1287648471942
“Answer in your turn, or you may repent of your disobedience.”	348.06811380710434
“King’s Musketeers,” said Athos, more and more convinced that he who	402.1209441455541
interrogated them had the right to do so.	460.1310234336806
“What company?”	432.76801010135796
“Company of Tréville.”	328.06070519574723
“Advance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour.”	482.63041226175153
The three companions advanced rather humbly—for all were now convinced	456.28835689909613
that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves—leaving	416.4782840325524
Athos the post of speaker.	314.8743834136745
One of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front	343.01828949073024
of his companion. Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to	317.46927302716415
remain in the rear, and advanced alone.	324.64312884316854
“Your pardon, my officer,” said Athos; “but we were ignorant with whom	336.1662717648586
we had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard.”	400.1473216984329
“Your name?” said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his	378.57611354884807
cloak.	485.35883174910873
“But yourself, monsieur,” said Athos, who began to be annoyed by this	434.7224875536431
inquisition, “give me, I beg you, the proof that you have the right to	315.78869452036685
question me.”	408.34042119231935
“Your name?” repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak	486.8069703153793
fall, and leaving his face uncovered.	427.5212620752873
“Monsieur the Cardinal!” cried the stupefied Musketeer.	313.638012213147
“Your name?” cried his Eminence, for the third time.	481.9590937782614
“Athos,” said the Musketeer.	423.79897806422645
The cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near. “These three	306.4760928806323
Musketeers shall follow us,” said he, in an undertone. “I am not	363.7173677195099
willing it should be known I have left the camp; and if they follow us	338.3624750118838
we shall be certain they will tell nobody.”	421.822850276204
“We are gentlemen, monseigneur,” said Athos; “require our parole, and	415.56556761833417
give yourself no uneasiness. Thank God, we can keep a secret.”	330.75776658392
The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.	386.02862218790125
“You have a quick ear, Monsieur Athos,” said the cardinal; “but now	381.8071994327771
listen to this. It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow	322.32507664986923
me, but for my security. Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos	442.81510663566644
and Aramis.”	351.3755708869254
“Yes, your Eminence,” said Athos, while the two Musketeers who had	469.1566628300501
remained behind advanced hat in hand.	340.3742800352393
“I know you, gentlemen,” said the cardinal, “I know you. I know you are	366.97293234096304
not quite my friends, and I am sorry you are not so; but I know you are	369.83251424387413
brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.	334.9186522129672
Monsieur Athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your	384.1352535630712
two friends, and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his	356.29918118641103
Majesty, if we should meet him.”	310.008577265236
The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses.	454.6956453245551
“Well, upon my honor,” said Athos, “your Eminence is right in taking us	363.9382283721899
with you; we have seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we	400.39959585699705
have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces.”	307.8778094420527
“A quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?” said the cardinal; “you know I	368.0501192158031
don’t like quarrelers.”	394.2624348343329
“And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of	454.80588182928733
what has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false	368.16609596341743
account believe us to be in fault.”	311.9586452185983
“What have been the results of your quarrel?” said the cardinal,	467.3772333738909
knitting his brow.	364.12541884610675
“My friend, Aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,	457.18643242803023
but not enough to prevent him, as your Eminence may see, from mounting	306.5350544875992
to the assault tomorrow, if your Eminence orders an escalade.”	491.02272788272364
“But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you	421.6676551704109
thus,” said the cardinal. “Come, be frank, gentlemen, you have settled	396.2501007389467
accounts with somebody! Confess; you know I have the right of giving	486.39278612645853
absolution.”	415.9294720045608
“I, monseigneur?” said Athos. “I did not even draw my sword, but I took	375.442377861827
him who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window. It	351.3452181801428
appears that in falling,” continued Athos, with some hesitation, “he	368.2398995334106
broke his thigh.”	457.1436279883815
“Ah, ah!” said the cardinal; “and you, Monsieur Porthos?”	366.0199372191806
“I, monseigneur, knowing that dueling is prohibited—I seized a bench,	394.4059339296306
and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder	385.25314904073906
is broken.”	347.93284376298516
“Very well,” said the cardinal; “and you, Monsieur Aramis?”	464.9792605772477
“Monseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of	357.35503333348527
which Monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, I	460.7061343674173
endeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a	459.70663536084203
wound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. Then I admit my	377.8778727170805
patience failed me; I drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to	328.01744151137405
the charge, I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let	327.82364649283267
it pass through his body. I only know for a certainty that he fell; and	390.6940371991751
it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions.”	409.6557821061615
“The devil, gentlemen!” said the cardinal, “three men placed _hors de	377.20492350796485
combat_ in a cabaret squabble! You don’t do your work by halves. And	482.60087039592895
pray what was this quarrel about?”	433.45118535567224
“These fellows were drunk,” said Athos, “and knowing there was a lady	344.64980575906446
who had arrived at the cabaret this evening, they wanted to force her	487.535711790962
door.”	475.56646111264797
“Force her door!” said the cardinal, “and for what purpose?”	416.79766502076393
“To do her violence, without doubt,” said Athos. “I have had the honor	368.33477388296285
of informing your Eminence that these men were drunk.”	431.5343830316705
“And was this lady young and handsome?” asked the cardinal, with a	375.1738504807928
certain degree of anxiety.	322.8957992818671
“We did not see her, monseigneur,” said Athos.	486.8646853855968
“You did not see her? Ah, very well,” replied the cardinal, quickly.	424.0606922531373
“You did well to defend the honor of a woman; and as I am going to the	394.4810027585391
Red Dovecot myself, I shall know if you have told me the truth.”	462.2369173096959
“Monseigneur,” said Athos, haughtily, “we are gentlemen, and to save	434.80755180151976
our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood.”	309.616261135961
“Therefore I do not doubt what you say, Monsieur Athos, I do not doubt	373.6417740938952
it for a single instant; but,” added he, “to change the conversation,	409.4810675012228
was this lady alone?”	292.6976412394379
“The lady had a cavalier shut up with her,” said Athos, “but as	436.01442304804334
notwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to	444.524999962229
be presumed that he is a coward.”	442.4829456167572
“‘Judge not rashly’, says the Gospel,” replied the cardinal.	380.16735164960323
Athos bowed.	317.40021160093625
“And now, gentlemen, that’s well,” continued the cardinal. “I know what	324.59404248724337
I wish to know; follow me.”	348.4560409153428
The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped	402.14631955620143
his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight	417.81853679394806
to ten paces in advance of his four companions.	403.424960114909
They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew	475.3153395517122
what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent	408.39571938641876
intruders out of the way.	405.7662895862195
Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the	428.3996865332614
three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window	294.78189678761777
shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner.	460.44503920673014
A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some	440.3066172175031
rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and	350.0707564035313
set off in the direction of Surgères, which was likewise the way to	297.4885184861666
Paris.	314.0033074893364
“Advance, gentlemen,” said the cardinal.	307.0084518032833
“You have told me the truth, my gentlemen,” said he, addressing the	336.4072938119886
Musketeers, “and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening	389.24143743518624
be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.”	390.8241372650764
The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal	372.5750819622915
threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers	384.62517587820327
fastened the horses to the shutters.	383.7762587104702
The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer	327.6537515599503
coming to visit a lady.	485.918459069042
“Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can	339.0230916717271
wait near a good fire?” said the cardinal.	449.7030934275981
The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had	310.11150305474916
just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney.	358.6471842082338
“I have this,” said he.	292.1553393890286
“That will do,” replied the cardinal. “Enter, gentlemen, and be kind	376.697604577683
enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.”	353.9376631883274
And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the	406.25497216846946
cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase	369.6500127503806
like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.	477.8890922468089
Chapter XLIV.	341.1452937164601
THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES	477.2720400908295
It was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their	445.39093981813096
chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just	401.08854606426576
rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special	413.37462060536825
protection.	478.46095395228133
Now, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers	378.7558355993752
put to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw	298.9751062750033
any light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice.	327.0036161210666
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.	370.21500819775
Athos walked about in a contemplative mood.	430.3956749611265
While thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe	483.6653924551076
of the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the	415.7554015978774
chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur	416.5017142900472
of words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it,	414.7947695770264
and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an	303.36585575113696
interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining	444.7319570265579
himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.	430.19190325729716
“Listen, Milady,” said the cardinal, “the affair is important. Sit	429.1695876827924
down, and let us talk it over.”	425.6676498596105
“Milady!” murmured Athos.	449.8635460722783
“I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention,” replied a female	300.5887170375563
voice which made the Musketeer start.	452.3273643375354
“A small vessel with an English crew, whose captain is on my side,	405.14699748279855
awaits you at the mouth of Charente, at Fort La Pointe*. He will set	480.0130790931258
sail tomorrow morning.”	356.8779142350199
* Fort La Pointe, or Fort Vasou, was not built until 1672, nearly 50	445.2272285783847
years later.	331.2762063929243
“I must go thither tonight?”	332.6473768566726
“Instantly! That is to say, when you have received my instructions. Two	359.8852043715873
men, whom you will find at the door on going out, will serve you as	471.36769678599296
escort. You will allow me to leave first; then, after half an hour, you	420.6379973585547
can go away in your turn.”	344.4482645069671
“Yes, monseigneur. Now let us return to the mission with which you wish	351.8580241982494
to charge me; and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of	432.3108186563928
your Eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise,	403.79147199469105
that I may not commit an error.”	360.6102187446812
There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors.	295.12473703278926
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in	346.19679538723506
which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her	445.276737641283
intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say,	296.4763835777328
and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.	338.95364310584813
Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to	300.1238866362825
fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with	459.045098748395
him.	293.2065499816579
The two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of	335.2481027309783
themselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads	426.6379513090322
together and their ears on the alert.	338.4336889978895
“You will go to London,” continued the cardinal. “Arrived in London,	452.62079924824616
you will seek Buckingham.”	357.1699277107009
“I must beg your Eminence to observe,” said Milady, “that since the	361.5685714594942
affair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me,	391.2777624308015
his Grace distrusts me.”	314.3066365200233
“Well, this time,” said the cardinal, “it is not necessary to steal his	397.9017785295908
confidence, but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a	366.66592399495426
negotiator.”	448.28821652714566
“Frankly and loyally,” repeated Milady, with an unspeakable expression	342.6430885486953
of duplicity.	328.0119231089342
“Yes, frankly and loyally,” replied the cardinal, in the same tone.	458.3194471416729
“All this negotiation must be carried on openly.”	335.15184585403864
“I will follow your Eminence’s instructions to the letter. I only wait	309.75949984386887
till you give them.”	302.0522653985869
“You will go to Buckingham in my behalf, and you will tell him I am	390.21474467998314
acquainted with all the preparations he has made; but that they give me	475.20722010220004
no uneasiness, since at the first step he takes I will ruin the queen.”	452.1592020210237
“Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the	414.4142755463117
threat thus made?”	348.9475890205474
“Yes; for I have the proofs.”	376.4399932475055
“I must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation.”	397.8263054524916
“Without doubt. And you will tell him I will publish the report of	344.70186173317165
Bois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru, upon the interview which the	468.16329484784376
duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the	304.57142615469473
evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade. You will tell him, in	359.967786740273
order that he may not doubt, that he came there in the costume of the	334.74402708686006
Great Mogul, which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn, and that he	456.9409863713628
purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles.”	330.01735187792633
“Well, monseigneur?”	331.9122913615453
“All the details of his coming into and going out of the palace—on the	432.3245527162021
night when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune	375.7730906730168
teller—you will tell him, that he may not doubt the correctness of my	435.3674788905659
information; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with	321.29498360139684
black tears, death’s heads, and crossbones—for in case of a surprise,	429.62920524990966
he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who, as all the world	476.790088446318
knows, appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending.”	346.0938621179186
“Is that all, monseigneur?”	465.0924036748677
“Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the	346.251728991694
adventure at Amiens; that I will have a little romance made of it,	470.3308786410247
wittily turned, with a plan of the garden and portraits of the	305.9415944214639
principal actors in that nocturnal romance.”	406.1629289602279
“I will tell him that.”	465.94492780957694
“Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power; that Montague is in	407.8936113475526
the Bastille; that no letters were found upon him, it is true, but that	391.30432074857066
torture may make him tell much of what he knows, and even what he does	425.1912584334767
not know.”	473.272206546099
“Exactly.”	336.6059334896614
“Then add that his Grace has, in the precipitation with which he quit	407.5497011336879
the Isle of Ré, forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain	363.8505598399804
letter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen,	464.19851311366074
inasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of	419.39211038148596
the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France. You	381.2186152353172
recollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?”	356.1314423072401
“Your Eminence will judge: the ball of Madame the Constable; the night	372.08554328142526
at the Louvre; the evening at Amiens; the arrest of Montague; the	407.8946721690164
letter of Madame de Chevreuse.”	481.79313333498874
“That’s it,” said the cardinal, “that’s it. You have an excellent	447.62764608193015
memory, Milady.”	304.57391578169955
“But,” resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering	333.39513492717026
compliment, “if, in spite of all these reasons, the duke does not give	358.0970862777293
way and continues to menace France?”	486.22194934673814
“The duke is in love to madness, or rather to folly,” replied	294.5298010726153
Richelieu, with great bitterness. “Like the ancient paladins, he has	440.48380456378993
only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love. If he	295.0974518249621
becomes certain that this war will cost the honor, and perhaps the	385.4964702636387
liberty, of the lady of his thoughts, as he says, I will answer for it	317.626385285512
he will look twice.”	441.0791030842665
“And yet,” said Milady, with a persistence that proved she wished to	417.2372411787802
see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be	317.72462678205454
charged, “if he persists?”	322.6885945235502
“If he persists?” said the cardinal. “That is not probable.”	442.05836862935723
“It is possible,” said Milady.	418.4636265663486
“If he persists—” His Eminence made a pause, and resumed: “If he	450.70068148705525
persists—well, then I shall hope for one of those events which change	467.2492666878875
the destinies of states.”	298.14388475292435
“If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in	483.05785743787095
history,” said Milady, “perhaps I should partake of your confidence as	431.37103162810854
to the future.”	323.4036755266029
“Well, here, for example,” said Richelieu: “when, in 1610, for a cause	399.4045228573283
similar to that which moves the duke, King Henry IV., of glorious	372.57357490409703
memory, was about, at the same time, to invade Flanders and Italy, in	440.275668818546
order to attack Austria on both sides. Well, did there not happen an	363.43676608023065
event which saved Austria? Why should not the king of France have the	441.0201525597138
same chance as the emperor?”	427.100535307178
“Your Eminence means, I presume, the knife stab in the Rue de la	488.84698213743593
Feronnerie?”	417.7112233676356
“Precisely,” said the cardinal.	322.81739837627407
“Does not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon	389.27783239746356
Ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating	417.4227284573943
him?”	374.8537628046915
“There will be, in all times and in all countries, particularly if	381.3126664357608
religious divisions exist in those countries, fanatics who ask nothing	475.7453304898248
better than to become martyrs. Ay, and observe—it just occurs to me	487.8202800448314
that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham, and their preachers	412.84114531720877
designate him as the Antichrist.”	466.04391542320445
“Well?” said Milady.	370.4276579837106
“Well,” continued the cardinal, in an indifferent tone, “the only thing	443.7879601458968
to be sought for at this moment is some woman, handsome, young, and	455.6248632372757
clever, who has cause of quarrel with the duke. The duke has had many	372.29227328994637
affairs of gallantry; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of	453.87192030470817
eternal constancy, he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by	383.2648881886368
his eternal infidelities.”	371.0127953899233
“No doubt,” said Milady, coolly, “such a woman may be found.”	419.3564478056044
“Well, such a woman, who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of	433.7990451789894
Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic, would save France.”	355.04006611646236
“Yes; but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination.”	446.14886045224216
“Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clément ever known?”	409.75131311533124
“No; for perhaps they were too high-placed for anyone to dare look for	386.08416356543637
them where they were. The Palace of Justice would not be burned down	440.65728242712817
for everybody, monseigneur.”	457.6640522984997
“You think, then, that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused	440.1406451318806
by chance?” asked Richelieu, in the tone with which he would have put a	431.7048325776525
question of no importance.	449.6168862537941
“I, monseigneur?” replied Milady. “I think nothing; I quote a fact,	423.4603456191539
that is all. Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier, or	444.3350593882153
the Queen Marie de Médicis, I should use less precautions than I take,	420.35024551898175
being simply called Milady Clarik.”	422.25783774797264
“That is just,” said Richelieu. “What do you require, then?”	302.3794423612317
“I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should	324.39819026385277
think proper to do for the greatest good of France.”	387.43731259048457
“But in the first place, this woman I have described must be found who	359.6239708082338
is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke.”	318.39670553225096
“She is found,” said Milady.	430.55539368103155
“Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an	347.2324164169433
instrument of God’s justice.”	477.23443105807155
“He will be found.”	330.43013845673903
“Well,” said the cardinal, “then it will be time to claim the order	292.3684411383889
which you just now required.”	401.6933214755534
“Your Eminence is right,” replied Milady; “and I have been wrong in	324.6420455422678
seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which	380.54283544944917
it really is—that is, to announce to his Grace, on the part of your	324.18730137208775
Eminence, that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means	312.86536912840745
of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by	339.08340398374895
Madame the Constable; that you have proofs of the interview granted at	355.90384660739363
the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no	299.81490004323143
other than the Duke of Buckingham; that you have ordered a little	382.4147999795707
romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of	343.42083694215995
Amiens, with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took	426.1383146469321
place, and portraits of the actors who figured in them; that Montague	381.4689125692173
is in the Bastille, and that the torture may make him say things he	478.9384415977315
remembers, and even things he has forgotten; that you possess a certain	306.30742581495156
letter from Madame de Chevreuse, found in his Grace’s lodging, which	341.21684905394
singularly compromises not only her who wrote it, but her in whose name	395.620563479202
it was written. Then, if he persists, notwithstanding all this—as that	303.7421294704622
is, as I have said, the limit of my mission—I shall have nothing to do	352.1332207955093
but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France. That is	348.4842801443551
it, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?”	430.9071505075806
“That is it,” replied the cardinal, dryly.	469.12866017814144
“And now,” said Milady, without appearing to remark the change of the	439.22611262177645
duke’s tone toward her—“now that I have received the instructions of	342.9634579302768
your Eminence as concerns your enemies, Monseigneur will permit me to	479.6698526909448
say a few words to him of mine?”	430.3165490796123
“Have you enemies, then?” asked Richelieu.	489.7563466327091
“Yes, monseigneur, enemies against whom you owe me all your support,	379.5607537574694
for I made them by serving your Eminence.”	449.8816716889048
“Who are they?” replied the duke.	312.51088111492516
“In the first place, there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacieux.”	416.14838549635533
“She is in the prison of Nantes.”	461.2935398608016
“That is to say, she was there,” replied Milady; “but the queen has	311.7495051051395
obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed	433.83804003869756
to a convent.”	292.90972876979487
“To a convent?” said the duke.	382.99052313799945
“Yes, to a convent.”	464.80080615427926
“And to which?”	397.19314742720564
“I don’t know; the secret has been well kept.”	425.5824422825481
“But _I_ will know!”	454.9070769597206
“And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?”	418.28432762751015
“I can see nothing inconvenient in that,” said the cardinal.	394.19097443601504
“Well, now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this	388.57704137770605
little Madame Bonacieux.”	412.2545352890248
“Who is that?”	404.1116601953334
“Her lover.”	409.853879590715
“What is his name?”	401.36274918557865
“Oh, your Eminence knows him well,” cried Milady, carried away by her	486.8509974442568
anger. “He is the evil genius of both of us. It is he who in an	303.10927129257976
encounter with your Eminence’s Guards decided the victory in favor of	427.54443209842714
the king’s Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to De	474.761985499032
Wardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs	418.0488460210102
to fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux	425.3578662840566
carried off, has sworn my death.”	371.3821059726388
“Ah, ah!” said the cardinal, “I know of whom you speak.”	295.268658845891
“I mean that miserable D’Artagnan.”	331.6185804262549
“He is a bold fellow,” said the cardinal.	363.93661481340973
“And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to	343.84270542886907
be feared.”	461.1698250419114
“I must have,” said the duke, “a proof of his connection with	398.4822066927163
Buckingham.”	432.2935921172724
“A proof?” cried Milady; “I will have ten.”	426.750000894755
“Well, then, it becomes the simplest thing in the world; get me that	393.9250208247172
proof, and I will send him to the Bastille.”	403.3820233818658
“So far good, monseigneur; but afterwards?”	407.908324568662
“When once in the Bastille, there is no afterward!” said the cardinal,	461.45548658803546
in a low voice. “Ah, _pardieu!_” continued he, “if it were as easy for	419.9277803717701
me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours, and if it	300.2319691343542
were against such people you require impunity—”	348.00242671692826
“Monseigneur,” replied Milady, “a fair exchange. Life for life, man for	377.42236989593613
man; give me one, I will give you the other.”	402.5467261065959
“I don’t know what you mean, nor do I even desire to know what you	298.6631183544301
mean,” replied the cardinal; “but I wish to please you, and see nothing	388.3662263503596
out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so	353.5658529864172
infamous a creature—the more so as you tell me this D’Artagnan is a	332.7868555650372
libertine, a duelist, and a traitor.”	358.3357219355453
“An infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!”	394.300765065564
“Give me paper, a quill, and some ink, then,” said the cardinal.	369.51383158102163
“Here they are, monseigneur.”	471.5347753305276
There was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was	311.41830220064134
employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or	322.3803175224991
else in writing it. Athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation,	392.25075734538433
took his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of	368.9766309715473
the room.	353.610716427988
“Well,” said Porthos, “what do you want, and why do you not let us	419.2240292297484
listen to the end of the conversation?”	418.2787809986609
“Hush!” said Athos, speaking in a low voice. “We have heard all it was	395.63961874173265
necessary we should hear; besides, I don’t prevent you from listening,	467.31894099532576
but I must be gone.”	361.8660876441675
“You must be gone!” said Porthos; “and if the cardinal asks for you,	442.5921802790516
what answer can we make?”	470.7787592887262
“You will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him	389.4238960597356
that I am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host	458.45886228140444
have given me reason to think the road is not safe. I will say two	311.9225036020258
words about it to the cardinal’s esquire likewise. The rest concerns	365.2194676663609
myself; don’t be uneasy about that.”	352.51541063529885
“Be prudent, Athos,” said Aramis.	292.01631751952766
“Be easy on that head,” replied Athos; “you know I am cool enough.”	337.9112225379376
Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.	313.4756195629742
As to Athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was	381.3556343890499
tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in	411.4581879612123
four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for	296.35864193741855
their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his	308.86935275116446
sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.	451.3427178783769
Chapter XLV.	353.44907700337876
A CONJUGAL SCENE	383.69957603590115
As Athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down.	397.40864896216493
He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were, and found	475.40272789855726
Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis. He cast a rapid	315.0581339526564
glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.	397.9658416903813
“What has become of Monseigneur Athos?” asked he.	415.61016114032594
“Monseigneur,” replied Porthos, “he has gone as a scout, on account of	343.4484349461138
some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe.”	364.1496304639701
“And you, what have you done, Monsieur Porthos?”	337.51902916482754
“I have won five pistoles of Aramis.”	454.70105500413365
“Well; now will you return with me?”	484.57765527432616
“We are at your Eminence’s orders.”	418.19878703528417
“To horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late.”	447.6376738806928
The attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal’s horse by the	337.24653730875497
bridle. At a short distance a group of two men and three horses	317.15952671293564
appeared in the shade. These were the two men who were to conduct	376.76140349498945
Milady to Fort La Pointe, and superintend her embarkation.	429.56886168972414
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had	317.3569467591328
already said with respect to Athos. The cardinal made an approving	412.88377988988043
gesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used	433.3655307651535
in coming.	302.2356379621696
Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his	400.9786172280072
esquire and the two Musketeers, and return to Athos.	431.9322490212253
For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but	321.4403485242274
when out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and	329.2948396704577
came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of	430.330230649673
the little troop. Having recognized the laced hats of his companions	350.65487574601957
and the golden fringe of the cardinal’s cloak, he waited till the	476.1508689967153
horsemen had turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of	390.0539481287959
them, he returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him	349.67553637375613
without hesitation.	306.7205208046129
The host recognized him.	487.9630371728812
“My officer,” said Athos, “has forgotten to give a piece of very	453.5885627791664
important information to the lady, and has sent me back to repair his	411.70962824823977
forgetfulness.”	430.8419888852254
“Go up,” said the host; “she is still in her chamber.”	412.09191849956665
Athos availed himself of the permission, ascended the stairs with his	394.93173102299545
lightest step, gained the landing, and through the open door perceived	380.0858994972499
Milady putting on her hat.	409.59282873964594
He entered the chamber and closed the door behind him. At the noise he	406.8031003506978
made in pushing the bolt, Milady turned round.	441.3562760240836
Athos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his	454.71576738257147
hat pulled down over his eyes. On seeing this figure, mute and	306.66166201584196
immovable as a statue, Milady was frightened.	468.0877086646793
“Who are you, and what do you want?” cried she.	328.2313143929285
“Humph,” murmured Athos, “it is certainly she!”	448.49438533092894
And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward	302.30808666166683
Milady.	344.304594085845
“Do you know me, madame?” said he.	364.674872986184
Milady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a	461.44256102884117
serpent.	407.0323204222227
“So far, well,” said Athos, “I perceive you know me.”	352.7602556109831
“The Comte de la Fère!” murmured Milady, becoming exceedingly pale, and	339.6847872055208
drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther.	349.1779597606318
“Yes, Milady,” replied Athos; “the Comte de la Fère in person, who	339.11273493386176
comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you	449.0812167007761
a visit. Sit down, madame, and let us talk, as the cardinal said.”	421.8015826379177
Milady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without	383.4612526786165
uttering a word.	311.697746560769
“You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth!” said Athos. “Your	478.94894819608464
power is great, I know; but you also know that with the help of God men	448.20371046645164
have often conquered the most terrible demons. You have once before	477.6630420126439
thrown yourself in my path. I thought I had crushed you, madame; but	419.8214659738244
either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you!”	427.1460503378075
Milady at these words, which recalled frightful remembrances, hung down	413.1488325072575
her head with a suppressed groan.	423.32578177642256
“Yes, hell has resuscitated you,” continued Athos. “Hell has made you	459.1749115165123
rich, hell has given you another name, hell has almost made you another	438.08105178088914
face; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the	430.9072402485689
brand from your body.”	372.0703681713587
Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed	325.9424949221481
lightning. Athos remained sitting.	402.9006734862499
“You believed me to be dead, did you not, as I believed you to be? And	317.4763281174247
the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fère, as the name	330.34286121295867
Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil. Was it not so you were called	379.71880084764774
when your honored brother married us? Our position is truly a strange	427.4746113213512
one,” continued Athos, laughing. “We have only lived up to the present	384.7234991687931
time because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance is	321.1109712550047
less oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is	431.94476783807704
sometimes devouring.”	340.90571650775587
“But,” said Milady, in a hollow, faint voice, “what brings you back to	467.01078944207484
me, and what do you want with me?”	337.3204192852537
“I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, I	364.0127097870966
have not lost sight of you.”	353.9535344829684
“You know what I have done?”	395.7551343580582
“I can relate to you, day by day, your actions from your entrance to	301.48972339616716
the service of the cardinal to this evening.”	395.0863578907496
A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady.	394.323279443024
“Listen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder	315.2929556087257
of the Duke of Buckingham; it was you who had Madame Bonacieux carried	302.701033264676
off; it was you who, in love with De Wardes and thinking to pass the	432.1992450939371
night with him, opened the door to Monsieur d’Artagnan; it was you who,	297.40758361663916
believing that De Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by	349.511900933168
his rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous	336.0641658904456
secret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom	447.3808859420362
you sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had	294.43002187147727
missed their mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make	368.9711472630439
your victim believe that the wine came from his friends. In short, it	326.9090220267375
was you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now	398.6386223819885
fill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of	318.307408512431
Buckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made	344.20534428043345
you to allow you to assassinate D’Artagnan.”	463.0302744695441
Milady was livid.	309.1616234687427
“You must be Satan!” cried she.	351.0879486307513
“Perhaps,” said Athos; “But at all events listen well to this.	301.5112053834268
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated—I	378.7419029050465
care very little about that! I don’t know him. Besides, he is an	409.7116724550839
Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair	486.09204911599124
of D’Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I	383.22060395390287
swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have	464.82461470422606
endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.”	380.04899057293
“Monsieur d’Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,” said Milady, in a hollow	332.67485494022554
tone; “Monsieur d’Artagnan shall die!”	395.4039686319572
“Indeed! Is it possible to insult you, madame?” said Athos, laughing;	472.19170294905666
“he has insulted you, and he shall die!”	435.75833257331226
“He shall die!” replied Milady; “she first, and he afterward.”	378.8328578820024
Athos was seized with a kind of vertigo. The sight of this creature,	298.53838316147295
who had nothing of the woman about her, recalled awful remembrances. He	442.3153131135661
thought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in	371.6858828296902
which he was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to	482.00098812455013
his honor. His desire for blood returned, burning his brain and	438.3887229309968
pervading his frame like a raging fever; he arose in his turn, reached	310.1438229665393
his hand to his belt, drew forth a pistol, and cocked it.	455.06597102133327
Milady, pale as a corpse, endeavored to cry out; but her swollen tongue	355.03657882293794
could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it	396.26438735828407
and resembled the rattle of a wild beast. Motionless against the dark	389.2197313462177
tapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image	387.3427871215747
of terror.	399.8134260121373
Athos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the	418.62968029903834
weapon almost touched Milady’s forehead, and then, in a voice the more	384.9277406565285
terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution,	417.00899644390097
“Madame,” said he, “you will this instant deliver to me the paper the	318.0725330254487
cardinal signed; or upon my soul, I will blow your brains out.”	466.38651226535626
With another man, Milady might have preserved some doubt; but she knew	403.65331958992647
Athos. Nevertheless, she remained motionless.	461.1442416831032
“You have one second to decide,” said he.	312.72708956197675
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was	475.2665710394349
about to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out	458.9448554080825
a paper, and held it toward Athos.	307.8361885728655
“Take it,” said she, “and be accursed!”	393.308909963575
Athos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the	338.10730161019563
lamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:	447.19454010812615
“Dec. 3, 1627	478.2314810494862
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of	337.8291059402344
this has done what he has done.	472.3699268572493
“RICHELIEU”	310.1865465210491
“And now,” said Athos, resuming his cloak and putting on his hat, “now	300.86480709765186
that I have drawn your teeth, viper, bite if you can.”	330.5390135353144
And he left the chamber without once looking behind him.	409.3738706470616
At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.	306.982979360465
“Gentlemen,” said he, “Monseigneur’s order is, you know, to conduct	344.9655745106405
that woman, without losing time, to Fort La Pointe, and never to leave	378.88799725492686
her till she is on board.”	444.0354273240665
As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they	411.27801837853525
bowed their heads in sign of assent.	461.6674145453077
With regard to Athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at	462.4962234480063
full gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the	450.2494981764861
fields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to	327.751804020516
listen.	462.38929496001856
In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.	482.57307432444816
He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. He immediately made	423.24707616720843
a new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and	466.9865415440381
leaves of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred	469.40653392345746
paces from the camp.	390.3833849471389
“Who goes there?” cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.	483.57159377677533
“That is our brave Musketeer, I think,” said the cardinal.	405.6766858197531
“Yes, monseigneur,” said Porthos, “it is he.”	409.89069162399215
“Monsieur Athos,” said Richelieu, “receive my thanks for the good guard	412.9562482623485
you have kept. Gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left.	304.02698529774284
The watchword is, ‘King and Ré.’”	427.09761256841625
Saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an	374.36117134926036
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his	467.0639377082333
attendant—for that night he himself slept in the camp.	440.05744163209215
“Well!” said Porthos and Aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was	380.8935441543299
out of hearing, “well, he signed the paper she required!”	351.80769151620433
“I know it,” said Athos, coolly, “since here it is.”	382.38959214877514
And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached	403.8913736149705
their quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. Only	480.73086060229247
they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested,	491.9577571246259
the instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the	299.3960227186632
Musketeers.	307.71193555885026
Milady, as Athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,	335.3326500934222
made no difficulty in following them. She had had for an instant an	415.089722113782
inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to	425.0642434072275
him; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the	490.575330921593
part of Athos. She might say that Athos had hanged her; but then Athos	383.0616630937169
would tell that she was branded. She thought it was best to preserve	381.8844255927493
silence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with	351.6516913754707
her usual skill; and then, all things being accomplished to the	350.78546466144627
satisfaction of the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance.	409.013180827236
In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o’clock she	380.7050663436663
was at the fort of the Point; at eight o’clock she had embarked; and at	297.68495892391076
nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was	475.43534642536736
supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its	452.17837848510874
course toward England.	306.7866774605113
Chapter XLVI.	370.8013320360204
THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS	398.9208351361025
On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, D’Artagnan found them	292.8195785431881
assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was	352.12421275102014
twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming	400.7963976686976
little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet.	390.15285816423597
“_Pardieu_, gentlemen,” said he. “I hope what you have to tell me is	358.47040827407545
worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for	411.6824818122811
making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night	446.87569497828986
spent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there,	358.5483845500073
gentlemen? It was warm work.”	406.1645420434246
“We were in a place where it was not very cold,” replied Porthos,	362.2862736156435
giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him.	354.192333874799
“Hush!” said Athos.	335.3840190727524
“Oh, oh!” said D’Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the	332.9481836282485
Musketeer. “It appears there is something fresh aboard.”	293.69257213423015
“Aramis,” said Athos, “you went to breakfast the day before yesterday	394.4316588132907
at the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?”	390.01169654387735
“Yes.”	309.91647497677735
“How did you fare?”	325.90081680363176
“For my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish	347.7533177315391
day, and they had nothing but meat.”	379.8408510528719
“What,” said Athos, “no fish at a seaport?”	477.48706063213655
“They say,” said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, “that the dyke	448.1502624109145
which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.”	303.7864627509065
“But that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,” replied Athos.	371.52379011329685
“I want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you.”	339.8595402390735
“Why, I think there were not many intruders. Yes, Athos, I know what	418.581212565854
you mean: we shall do very well at the Parpaillot.”	440.9825980791037
“Let us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets	417.5632240041681
of paper.”	388.24499124320124
D’Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend’s manner of acting, and	483.2574896594966
who perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him,	388.0995209004132
that the circumstances were serious, took Athos’s arm, and went out	445.1482340872084
without saying anything. Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis.	406.7883999979907
On their way they met Grimaud. Athos made him a sign to come with them.	448.79537399754184
Grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had	343.7735620526048
nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.	330.912698365797
They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot. It was seven	299.57395576292157
o’clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. The three friends	374.72910197292487
ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they	316.51177789875084
would not be disturbed.	466.14685147878754
Unfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. The	333.34578713554004
morning drum had just been beaten; everyone shook off the drowsiness of	374.4377123660494
night, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the	317.30674892837845
inn. Dragoons, Swiss, Guardsmen, Musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded	427.6722392777727
one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host	371.682315465987
very well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends. Thus	374.4383395296157
they applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of	465.6147989312568
their companions.	443.4499049985044
“I see how it will be,” said Athos: “we shall get into some pretty	402.40017433648876
quarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now. D’Artagnan, tell	390.3151047041416
us what sort of a night you have had, and we will describe ours	314.46437332460323
afterward.”	429.0953838892861
“Ah, yes,” said a light-horseman, with a glass of brandy in his hand,	322.76052290746156
which he sipped slowly. “I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been	390.6855639465147
in the trenches tonight, and that you did not get much the best of the	346.92686350021114
Rochellais.”	299.0668148634894
D’Artagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this	407.8226597125798
intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation.	361.75014653944123
“Well,” said Athos, “don’t you hear Monsieur de Busigny, who does you	463.095873587888
the honor to ask you a question? Relate what has passed during the	341.67972608812465
night, since these gentlemen desire to know it.”	483.12138391310964
“Have you not taken a bastion?” said a Swiss, who was drinking rum out	442.31936239338063
of a beer glass.	446.4547900895801
“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing, “we have had that honor. We	296.8023157747491
even have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under	311.0433218773339
one of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.	416.38534606929164
Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the	460.75780798808233
rest of the building was badly shaken.”	389.3316906084582
“And what bastion is it?” asked a dragoon, with his saber run through a	410.9031913659879
goose which he was taking to be cooked.	480.1991936159209
“The bastion St. Gervais,” replied D’Artagnan, “from behind which the	327.10113845076796
Rochellais annoyed our workmen.”	386.1423690943002
“Was that affair hot?”	408.51898609921346
“Yes, moderately so. We lost five men, and the Rochellais eight or	328.75933618876303
ten.”	411.3737386931763
“_Balzempleu!_” said the Swiss, who, notwithstanding the admirable	441.2841647260473
collection of oaths possessed by the German language, had acquired a	335.9019554974706
habit of swearing in French.	340.2182422476544
“But it is probable,” said the light-horseman, “that they will send	426.9012686338698
pioneers this morning to repair the bastion.”	461.1567002306722
“Yes, that’s probable,” said D’Artagnan.	360.5097451835566
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “a wager!”	300.4351510953355
“Ah, _wooi_, a vager!” cried the Swiss.	338.00944364215286
“What is it?” said the light-horseman.	466.06450034198986
“Stop a bit,” said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the	428.0347251950194
two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, “stop a	482.0006507016061
bit, I am in it. You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I	327.4715617751837
may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird.”	391.9475540093613
“You was right,” said the Swiss; “goose grease is kood with basdry.”	399.1315659723882
“There!” said the dragoon. “Now for the wager! We listen, Monsieur	437.1123335382799
Athos.”	393.00992623868973
“Yes, the wager!” said the light-horseman.	465.744271873275
“Well, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,” said Athos, “that my three	339.4446767756309
companions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan, and myself, will	332.2140254352057
go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there	333.61010856246565
an hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.”	408.7787063666117
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.	481.6836516790682
“But,” said D’Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, “you are going to get us	444.62012301190657
all killed without mercy.”	383.2920723408813
“We are much more likely to be killed,” said Athos, “if we do not go.”	472.5954646268832
“My faith, gentlemen,” said Porthos, turning round upon his chair and	377.57181713914946
twisting his mustache, “that’s a fair bet, I hope.”	349.09201826162854
“I take it,” said M. de Busigny; “so let us fix the stake.”	406.63921689967935
“You are four gentlemen,” said Athos, “and we are four; an unlimited	346.4950402647004
dinner for eight. Will that do?”	301.7501862289072
“Capitally,” replied M. de Busigny.	489.5549651566458
“Perfectly,” said the dragoon.	421.82646050088977
“That shoots me,” said the Swiss.	427.13892552530433
The fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a mute	384.8246660792277
part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the	491.00623073610865
proposition.	418.98857173672303
“The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready,” said the host.	355.8890966235592
“Well, bring it,” said Athos.	418.5011862704136
The host obeyed. Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which	349.49962387530974
lay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the	324.1148376227163
napkins.	339.00850174879133
Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the	431.17321204861616
basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the	374.85461673354996
basket on his arm.	395.69784245399
“But where are you going to eat my breakfast?” asked the host.	316.41308937129895
“What matter, if you are paid for it?” said Athos, and he threw two	328.45822909191895
pistoles majestically on the table.	427.07727442990205
“Shall I give you the change, my officer?” said the host.	292.4388121314986
“No, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for	311.1871206115452
the napkins.”	378.72813047347756
The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for, but	297.16713629569995
he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two	463.2862885765761
bottles of champagne.	458.17229462627176
“Monsieur de Busigny,” said Athos, “will you be so kind as to set your	459.32912656953795
watch with mine, or permit me to regulate mine by yours?”	459.27247262755634
“Which you please, monsieur!” said the light-horseman, drawing from his	359.8211410602457
fob a very handsome watch, studded with diamonds; “half past seven.”	435.2109169239693
“Thirty-five minutes after seven,” said Athos, “by which you perceive I	436.77546270567996
am five minutes faster than you.”	374.2148628761482
And bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took	296.88567405815047
the road to the bastion St. Gervais, followed by Grimaud, who carried	328.49150606539587
the basket, ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience	312.7267216563994
which Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.	461.924905781387
As long as they were within the circle of the camp, the four friends	298.09279403262354
did not exchange one word; besides, they were followed by the curious,	422.3125508075879
who, hearing of the wager, were anxious to know how they would come out	294.4278336653916
of it. But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found	358.48141933273484
themselves in the open plain, D’Artagnan, who was completely ignorant	456.18014261162887
of what was going forward, thought it was time to demand an	406.9881052640143
explanation.	307.90130266718825
“And now, my dear Athos,” said he, “do me the kindness to tell me where	464.22774891386445
we are going?”	477.190126608201
“Why, you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion.”	318.2398499721785
“But what are we going to do there?”	329.5077577045612
“You know well that we go to breakfast there.”	454.66646052165515
“But why did we not breakfast at the Parpaillot?”	410.35231228623434
“Because we have very important matters to communicate to one another,	294.4072872322017
and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being	318.2875875950558
annoyed by all those importunate fellows, who keep coming in, saluting	413.2949629469757
you, and addressing you. Here at least,” said Athos, pointing to the	478.76681434451854
bastion, “they will not come and disturb us.”	305.36599386164863
“It appears to me,” said D’Artagnan, with that prudence which allied	325.7842541130519
itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, “that we could have	378.9007399836863
found some retired place on the downs or the seashore.”	407.92246418545545
“Where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that	369.70802721890914
at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been	324.224919857155
informed by his spies that we were holding a council.”	404.75103496797834
“Yes,” said Aramis, “Athos is right: _Animadvertuntur in desertis_.”	312.8559482871289
“A desert would not have been amiss,” said Porthos; “but it behooved us	426.87100200051174
to find it.”	373.5948364684427
“There is no desert where a bird cannot pass over one’s head, where a	420.1487433904819
fish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of	438.49738987720724
its burrow, and I believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a	362.2415142935157
spy of the cardinal. Better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which,	386.5050233143953
besides, we cannot retreat without shame. We have made a wager—a wager	365.62542625852166
which could not have been foreseen, and of which I defy anyone to	317.06528434658054
divine the true cause. We are going, in order to win it, to remain an	480.05430822082144
hour in the bastion. Either we shall be attacked, or not. If we are	329.65792237587146
not, we shall have all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us—for I	314.9587420233291
guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will	387.1795107871342
talk of our affairs just the same. Moreover, in defending ourselves, we	337.9109735433179
shall cover ourselves with glory. You see that everything is to our	477.34428746964636
advantage.”	419.0669973594112
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan; “but we shall indubitably attract a ball.”	453.8997866921578
“Well, my dear,” replied Athos, “you know well that the balls most to	440.8033895141201
be dreaded are not from the enemy.”	393.990496776487
“But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our	478.26339959277664
muskets.”	403.4686503944794
“You are stupid, friend Porthos. Why should we load ourselves with a	404.853538903677
useless burden?”	395.1217037696384
“I don’t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very	486.69588272792106
useless in the face of an enemy.”	400.5206979031019
“Well,” replied Athos, “have you not heard what D’Artagnan said?”	293.45586886402435
“What did he say?” demanded Porthos.	447.65834034983476
“D’Artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten	471.3311416235242
Frenchmen were killed, and as many Rochellais.”	453.6432855098909
“What then?”	371.7300885304136
“The bodies were not plundered, were they? It appears the conquerors	354.0089304857942
had something else to do.”	304.69540265437655
“Well?”	470.3436725840888
“Well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;	380.2856827574822
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen	378.62082580806197
guns and a hundred charges to fire.”	443.4723738359522
“Oh, Athos!” said Aramis, “truly you are a great man.”	307.8305233500506
Porthos nodded in sign of agreement. D’Artagnan alone did not seem	304.43789086562356
convinced.	312.9205115123388
Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing	429.13618585344966
that they continued to advance toward the bastion—something he had till	444.6111220317593
then doubted—he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.	329.19794989653394
“Where are we going?” asked he, by a gesture.	432.43570046748926
Athos pointed to the bastion.	491.4333563205854
“But,” said Grimaud, in the same silent dialect, “we shall leave our	422.4456218995644
skins there.”	356.1555762373097
Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.	327.1164270451926
Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the	373.75308128543816
head.	303.1899565919441
Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly	368.62229393452105
primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud’s ear.	379.8466212191555
Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him a	425.9524623430285
sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All	427.79530370771187
that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the	392.20109762675037
rear guard to the vanguard.	323.3187843117252
Arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.	420.4076576830988
More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the	303.81362252269605
gate of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de	414.1202096564416
Busigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor.	417.1558052890954
Athos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it	437.67216406518503
in the air.	329.80060686197635
All the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy	452.4265537725529
with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four	411.1875240028363
disappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them.	445.2313409458418
Chapter XLVII.	420.31719092658216
THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS	410.76524633735517
As Athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen	456.92299140764067
corpses, French and Rochellais.	483.13368481699695
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition,	341.43821437765894
“while Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns	369.7084025046879
and cartridges together. We can talk while performing that necessary	468.1201739719913
task. These gentlemen,” added he, pointing to the bodies, “cannot hear	415.3143247614788
us.”	331.7691789565052
“But we could throw them into the ditch,” said Porthos, “after having	473.08780920128504
assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets.”	311.2970122866435
“Yes,” said Athos, “that’s Grimaud’s business.”	435.8968122321579
“Well, then,” cried D’Artagnan, “pray let Grimaud search them and throw	398.5488540428785
them over the walls.”	353.2407796867326
“Heaven forfend!” said Athos; “they may serve us.”	404.22283697746605
“These bodies serve us?” said Porthos. “You are mad, dear friend.”	314.842332995084
“Judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,” replied Athos.	472.58031713980233
“How many guns, gentlemen?”	315.48830856372456
“Twelve,” replied Aramis.	337.6187496065723
“How many shots?”	393.4836158153381
“A hundred.”	465.4719879302279
“That’s quite as many as we shall want. Let us load the guns.”	427.494544697426
The four Musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last	335.27749410091053
musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.	424.6988758068958
Athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to	404.5668624248052
Grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that	448.0178793522574
he was to stand as sentinel. Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the	385.38012588904064
duty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of	366.7543130897217
wine.	332.03786508733924
“And now to table,” said Athos.	462.9323319837881
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs	393.51127389117084
crossed like Turks, or even tailors.	482.53584789049063
“And now,” said D’Artagnan, “as there is no longer any fear of being	431.88110530798974
overheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.”	382.57953343481296
“I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory,	482.0250375027214
gentlemen,” said Athos. “I have induced you to take a charming	299.3453194745215
promenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred	430.66257908748867
persons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or	464.09592187848887
madmen—two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.”	426.4627921466777
“But the secret!” said D’Artagnan.	373.86376222621016
“The secret is,” said Athos, “that I saw Milady last night.”	388.53820840045967
D’Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady,	301.0338103160021
his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the	403.40584021023795
ground again for fear of spilling the contents.”	397.4859874227976
“You saw your wi—”	307.57405756075735
“Hush!” interrupted Athos. “You forget, my dear, you forget that these	479.49684967843586
gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I	429.8258230370892
have seen Milady.”	306.8519136494779
“Where?” demanded D’Artagnan.	430.97948270310854
“Within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.”	460.0895504270718
“In that case I am lost,” said D’Artagnan.	427.4280082398865
“Not so bad yet,” replied Athos; “for by this time she must have quit	448.43537095717056
the shores of France.”	440.3499687840649
D’Artagnan breathed again.	469.7696769816855
“But after all,” asked Porthos, “who is Milady?”	485.0228458500237
“A charming woman!” said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.	400.52746767178917
“Villainous host!” cried he, “he has given us Anjou wine instead of	324.31199696512107
champagne, and fancies we know no better! Yes,” continued he, “a	384.8413682138151
charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend	299.9714263291826
D’Artagnan, who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she	295.55528217232154
tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket	433.2799440960501
shots, a week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding	483.000040693008
his head of the cardinal.”	489.15418373995044
“What! by demanding my head of the cardinal?” cried D’Artagnan, pale	415.8694370335418
with terror.	353.83929856834504
“Yes, that is true as the Gospel,” said Porthos; “I heard her with my	332.82024603378505
own ears.”	429.50357681393047
“I also,” said Aramis.	362.6746771222129
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, “it	422.58938430057685
is useless to struggle longer. I may as well blow my brains out, and	444.59039022868865
all will be over.”	380.1587420293131
“That’s the last folly to be committed,” said Athos, “seeing it is the	490.41726008088744
only one for which there is no remedy.”	491.9980091309051
“But I can never escape,” said D’Artagnan, “with such enemies. First,	389.2404242584937
my stranger of Meung; then De Wardes, to whom I have given three sword	296.1552785040173
wounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the	486.26590471766804
cardinal, whose vengeance I have balked.”	480.73641163527924
“Well,” said Athos, “that only makes four; and we are four—one for one.	408.2620227225248
_Pardieu!_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about	453.5727622245387
to have to do with a very different number of people. What is it,	376.13451042302233
Grimaud? Considering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to	303.5874828178166
speak, my friend; but be laconic, I beg. What do you see?”	349.82448459852503
“A troop.”	384.42827427374107
“Of how many persons?”	483.77069133657665
“Twenty men.”	410.1651834663454
“What sort of men?”	327.259350060017
“Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers.”	346.1544902549502
“How far distant?”	298.085208920028
“Five hundred paces.”	360.8399860348737
“Good! We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of	357.2935295872583
wine to your health, D’Artagnan.”	461.7303896898118
“To your health!” repeated Porthos and Aramis.	415.6360169708291
“Well, then, to my health! although I am very much afraid that your	364.89688602596067
good wishes will not be of great service to me.”	292.67928422016246
“Bah!” said Athos, “God is great, as say the followers of Mohammed, and	478.32542456065283
the future is in his hands.”	363.28746077961216
Then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to	322.6447019440386
him, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near	429.0166273188032
to one of the loopholes.	479.1059843548331
Porthos, Aramis and D’Artagnan followed his example. As to Grimaud, he	405.5876458557987
received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to	491.7796119584481
reload their weapons.	413.7578348592794
“_Pardieu!_” said Athos, “it was hardly worth while to distribute	483.60923218302526
ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and	372.2558172397067
shovels. Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am	398.4661437117431
convinced they would have left us in peace.”	332.0513394237743
“I doubt that,” replied D’Artagnan, “for they are advancing very	339.9719499248804
resolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four	411.75562115882633
soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.”	411.07770265292555
“That’s because they don’t see us,” said Athos.	360.01948330815287
“My faith,” said Aramis, “I must confess I feel a great repugnance to	367.64458326103477
fire on these poor devils of civilians.”	405.4156920109647
“He is a bad priest,” said Porthos, “who has pity for heretics.”	303.6838663277454
“In truth,” said Athos, “Aramis is right. I will warn them.”	447.9989759925744
“What the devil are you going to do?” cried D’Artagnan, “you will be	433.1521843633736
shot.”	486.9519610822582
But Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his	389.42457516007846
musket in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing	406.14801485245744
courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who,	367.9617420426015
astonished at this apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion:	324.9647534694276
“Gentlemen, a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this	424.54921182222904
bastion. Now, you know nothing is more disagreeable than being	361.133309999733
disturbed when one is at breakfast. We request you, then, if you really	472.97127754739694
have business here, to wait till we have finished our repast, or to	470.6279419369182
come again a short time hence; unless, which would be far better, you	450.60303967659775
form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come	399.6470046266116
and drink with us to the health of the King of France.”	402.19768816547503
“Take care, Athos!” cried D’Artagnan; “don’t you see they are aiming?”	484.8831345785521
“Yes, yes,” said Athos; “but they are only civilians—very bad marksmen,	432.3688421370571
who will be sure not to hit me.”	425.1891161992548
In fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were	341.2897128431079
flattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.	425.65576258299893
Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better	445.0521518299229
aimed than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one	308.68153300532924
of the pioneers was wounded.	476.469652754234
“Grimaud,” said Athos, still on the breach, “another musket!”	490.83713054054977
Grimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had	357.84680570263663
reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The	480.2053097245072
brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to	441.428447821664
flight.	395.55877573950215
“Now, gentlemen, a _sortie!_” cried Athos.	343.7867113901019
And the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of	414.3772353701281
battle, picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of	406.7917342546918
the brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till	366.08874934700935
they reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with	348.7754867996082
them the trophies of their victory.	491.4762806353881
“Reload the muskets, Grimaud,” said Athos, “and we, gentlemen, will go	373.5576326332432
on with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. Where were we?”	445.91059763189406
“I recollect you were saying,” said D’Artagnan, “that after having	331.20868735235143
demanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France.	481.26364017489425
Whither goes she?” added he, strongly interested in the route Milady	477.9271574888693
followed.	488.0194340792757
“She goes into England,” said Athos.	429.941925573229
“With what view?”	336.6168912640486
“With the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the	489.7611970031751
Duke of Buckingham.”	306.9468335028578
D’Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.	363.37740357136045
“But this is infamous!” cried he.	486.60824022486463
“As to that,” said Athos, “I beg you to believe that I care very little	361.4175801917439
about it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier’s half-pike,	298.40389192062804
tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these	318.5199064463286
rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and	337.50850488970343
loyal soldiers of the king.”	485.1389421394806
Grimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag	451.52544343271416
was floating over the heads of the four friends. A thunder of applause	458.3476049209319
saluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.	437.1911889317435
“How?” replied D’Artagnan, “you care little if she kills Buckingham or	313.77196018306336
causes him to be killed? But the duke is our friend.”	405.6873301143824
“The duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she	392.37073868746916
likes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.”	335.06015979634384
And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he	358.828137610436
had poured the last drop into his glass.	411.634892439856
“A moment,” said D’Artagnan. “I will not abandon Buckingham thus. He	322.2101003547761
gave us some very fine horses.”	311.8841053930267
“And moreover, very handsome saddles,” said Porthos, who at the moment	415.6589348415899
wore on his cloak the lace of his own.	298.77771095467745
“Besides,” said Aramis, “God desires the conversion and not the death	346.58790488201043
of a sinner.”	413.0194248982308
“Amen!” said Athos, “and we will return to that subject later, if such	481.74833612500265
be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most	379.588836765829
earnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, D’Artagnan, was the	312.83700989984374
getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had	488.92859489439854
extorted from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with	394.74092385286167
impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us.”	441.46285152459586
“But this creature must be a demon!” said Porthos, holding out his	441.05797383147
plate to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.	366.2159077603194
“And this _carte blanche_,” said D’Artagnan, “this _carte blanche_,	361.73696612392155
does it remain in her hands?”	447.4292829251123
“No, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did	366.3357306926024
I should tell a lie.”	485.993328476332
“My dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am	304.07168990629134
indebted to you for my life.”	420.11073360889225
“Then it was to go to her that you left us?” said Aramis.	298.12770314884534
“Exactly.”	474.29717288776123
“And you have that letter of the cardinal?” said D’Artagnan.	353.44409297711934
“Here it is,” said Athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the	330.11432880189494
pocket of his uniform. D’Artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose	294.17963276057293
trembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:	296.53908309849936
“Dec. 3, 1627	460.8420006824893
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of	442.39079709230316
this has done what he has done.	356.7505116696551
“RICHELIEU”	443.5406871879603
“In fact,” said Aramis, “it is an absolution according to rule.”	346.89477809765214
“That paper must be torn to pieces,” said D’Artagnan, who fancied he	425.83069677987885
read in it his sentence of death.	461.4850703105544
“On the contrary,” said Athos, “it must be preserved carefully. I would	311.10231232706343
not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces.”	315.348448853007
“And what will she do now?” asked the young man.	447.5436149548784
“Why,” replied Athos, carelessly, “she is probably going to write to	395.61369650008965
the cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her	464.9427422521311
safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter	367.5072317490818
to get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time.	293.3428996974911
The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often	473.3612624153942
crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest D’Artagnan,	303.4853955341171
and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company	292.3904526839101
in the Bastille.”	445.22148200572303
“Go to! It appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear,” said Porthos.	401.4780560798827
“I do not jest,” said Athos.	452.0692775328015
“Do you know,” said Porthos, “that to twist that damned Milady’s neck	364.9980302216792
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of	297.32341188810784
Huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the	405.5218972912452
psalms we sing in Latin?”	351.2161001533923
“What says the abbé?” asked Athos, quietly.	331.04446535004445
“I say I am entirely of Porthos’s opinion,” replied Aramis.	327.8429480367556
“And I, too,” said D’Artagnan.	293.2467609375647
“Fortunately, she is far off,” said Porthos, “for I confess she would	362.4060498444554
worry me if she were here.”	390.82354476665483
“She worries me in England as well as in France,” said Athos.	365.3205238970005
“She worries me everywhere,” said D’Artagnan.	476.57000348535314
“But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,	298.75521192084534
strangle her, hang her?” said Porthos. “It is only the dead who do not	292.332265588492
return.”	436.513998239439
“You think so, Porthos?” replied the Musketeer, with a sad smile which	422.2393564779589
D’Artagnan alone understood.	375.0610135042222
“I have an idea,” said D’Artagnan.	460.51974209397656
“What is it?” said the Musketeers.	327.3093098002644
“To arms!” cried Grimaud.	434.4115994310327
The young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.	479.12273445576574
This time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to	407.956774725645
twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the	450.79474763865915
garrison.	400.68171230245014
“Shall we return to the camp?” said Porthos. “I don’t think the sides	470.5850589013975
are equal.”	419.7566859643427
“Impossible, for three reasons,” replied Athos. “The first, that we	482.8906056907167
have not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very	407.2237355428616
important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes	434.0707553783489
before the lapse of the hour.”	484.7211748870334
“Well, then,” said Aramis, “we must form a plan of battle.”	407.5101678801798
“That’s very simple,” replied Athos. “As soon as the enemy are within	400.2445346329088
musket shot, we must fire upon them. If they continue to advance, we	309.3137325224613
must fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those	299.1055715185394
who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow	448.0245035523179
the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down	413.1880412962312
upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a	325.9401646808775
miracle.”	304.3760178057158
“Bravo!” cried Porthos. “Decidedly, Athos, you were born to be a	441.9511124081066
general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is	349.4088315629004
nothing beside you.”	435.144206391921
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “no divided attention, I beg; let each one	380.60968004738214
pick out his man.”	464.46764983583387
“I cover mine,” said D’Artagnan.	421.9418506384881
“And I mine,” said Porthos.	466.97770698652846
“And I _idem_,” said Aramis.	448.31251987773106
“Fire, then,” said Athos.	366.5711455578535
The four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.	444.7165376263078
The drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging	346.3666344197416
pace.	336.16409621007864
Then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with	391.82716811359256
the same accuracy. Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the	373.1507803301331
numerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance	409.0736574841177
in quick time.	436.18009865125555
With every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those	311.99713470517383
who remained was not slackened.	471.6781812757524
Arrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen	345.6960989744836
of the enemy. A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them;	327.75902458562683
they jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.	365.3570908750263
“Now, my friends,” said Athos, “finish them at a blow. To the wall; to	488.3079750950993
the wall!”	476.701107609613
And the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of	429.3058938858848
their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by	433.32713217665685
the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible	395.46959231929253
crash into the ditch. Then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust	471.2419456192046
mounted toward the sky—and all was over!	478.35876950603756
“Can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?” said	405.1225106458718
Athos.	344.53172558241687
“My faith, it appears so!” said D’Artagnan.	476.34450950883445
“No,” cried Porthos; “there go three or four, limping away.”	310.48522507288726
In fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and	325.54179245080246
blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city.	292.14937837459206
These were all who were left of the little troop.	305.4128677946478
Athos looked at his watch.	318.4822153385737
“Gentlemen,” said he, “we have been here an hour, and our wager is won;	485.6075339958215
but we will be fair players. Besides, D’Artagnan has not told us his	399.6615976960122
idea yet.”	297.72429604612125
And the Musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the	445.56069254822773
remains of the breakfast.	447.2024980963394
“My idea?” said D’Artagnan.	325.59019957421293
“Yes; you said you had an idea,” said Athos.	387.37199405016344
“Oh, I remember,” said D’Artagnan. “Well, I will go to England a second	308.3555289542985
time; I will go and find Buckingham.”	307.19082252102976
“You shall not do that, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, coolly.	323.3310015012513
“And why not? Have I not been there once?”	381.633996492221
“Yes; but at that period we were not at war. At that period Buckingham	423.5549661223281
was an ally, and not an enemy. What you would now do amounts to	403.84572317787365
treason.”	325.92528188641523
D’Artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.	440.253907069054
“But,” said Porthos, “I think I have an idea, in my turn.”	371.6143355971451
“Silence for Monsieur Porthos’s idea!” said Aramis.	476.2820768484054
“I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tréville, on some pretext	398.91183217412845
or other which you must invent; I am not very clever at pretexts.	347.0176220802394
Milady does not know me; I will get access to her without her	390.0061043770858
suspecting me, and when I catch my beauty, I will strangle her.”	348.2550414336607
“Well,” replied Athos, “I am not far from approving the idea of	328.0550370331192
Monsieur Porthos.”	481.59107676760004
“For shame!” said Aramis. “Kill a woman? No, listen to me; I have the	375.3074762451944
true idea.”	346.28744120689623
“Let us see your idea, Aramis,” said Athos, who felt much deference for	308.010235070175
the young Musketeer.	467.9486167058137
“We must inform the queen.”	376.9217772914154
“Ah, my faith, yes!” said Porthos and D’Artagnan, at the same time; “we	416.0817976327691
are coming nearer to it now.”	412.9932357782391
“Inform the queen!” said Athos; “and how? Have we relations with the	429.16610060974836
court? Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the	373.63374551594217
camp? From here to Paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our	462.24427750316954
letter was at Angers we should be in a dungeon.”	439.0858585278842
“As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty,” said Aramis,	418.0287764230699
coloring, “I will take that upon myself. I know a clever person at	413.40808821668287
Tours—”	398.90705344045176
Aramis stopped on seeing Athos smile.	349.73510962071066
“Well, do you not adopt this means, Athos?” said D’Artagnan.	419.8142173043986
“I do not reject it altogether,” said Athos; “but I wish to remind	485.1035071329072
Aramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of	385.89769618138587
ourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set	414.42671963926233
out, all the Capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the	341.3332326793576
cardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever	479.24097353971325
person will be arrested.”	349.750567355717
“Without reckoning,” objected Porthos, “that the queen would save	446.9197825421441
Monsieur de Buckingham, but would take no heed of us.”	448.03652556393206
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “what Porthos says is full of sense.”	354.73174564808807
“Ah, ah! but what’s going on in the city yonder?” said Athos.	445.721993847507
“They are beating the general alarm.”	324.62484545024415
The four friends listened, and the sound of the drum plainly reached	425.062501132196
them.	470.94907787452917
“You see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us,” said	450.3409394293668
Athos.	439.36094482108
“You don’t think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?” said	375.6189038675491
Porthos.	311.11648650621305
“Why not?” said the Musketeer. “I feel myself quite in a humor for it;	472.38929183651146
and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to	342.24116062601206
bring a dozen more bottles of wine.”	351.3617436144178
“Upon my word, the drum draws near,” said D’Artagnan.	350.26375976296043
“Let it come,” said Athos. “It is a quarter of an hour’s journey from	321.3990738854064
here to the city, consequently a quarter of an hour’s journey from the	302.6796663199515
city to hither. That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan.	353.5393512543161
If we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable. Ah,	379.7086801335953
stop! I have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me.”	484.49730240053543
“Tell us.”	440.6250937456647
“Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders.”	407.7195161589709
Athos made a sign for his lackey to approach.	474.4937336751689
“Grimaud,” said Athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall	445.22120870110876
of the bastion, “take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall,	306.07515501217733
put their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands.”	347.40629661603197
“Oh, the great man!” cried D’Artagnan. “I comprehend now.”	478.006280091895
“You comprehend?” said Porthos.	403.07432787958294
“And do you comprehend, Grimaud?” said Aramis.	370.6764611136392
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative.	295.1050359551485
“That’s all that is necessary,” said Athos; “now for my idea.”	435.8972123595904
“I should like, however, to comprehend,” said Porthos.	467.9160463216765
“That is useless.”	371.7644510644106
“Yes, yes! Athos’s idea!” cried Aramis and D’Artagnan, at the same	457.78988148044357
time.	383.20612421230584
“This Milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a	426.4655942279256
brother-in-law, as I think you told me, D’Artagnan?”	400.8353137292637
“Yes, I know him very well; and I also believe that he has not a very	450.2835727362831
warm affection for his sister-in-law.”	378.7711433837111
“There is no harm in that. If he detested her, it would be all the	327.37163494329815
better,” replied Athos.	357.1441256738935
“In that case we are as well off as we wish.”	362.24458707295474
“And yet,” said Porthos, “I would like to know what Grimaud is about.”	414.91246008680986
“Silence, Porthos!” said Aramis.	361.16833045617295
“What is her brother-in-law’s name?”	344.29436787790905
“Lord de Winter.”	336.1308427040205
“Where is he now?”	325.0903999983652
“He returned to London at the first sound of war.”	479.22546537751833
“Well, there’s just the man we want,” said Athos. “It is he whom we	345.20898461564184
must warn. We will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the	461.25803772317647
point of having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of	347.1703532438292
her. There is in London, I hope, some establishment like that of the	355.5512779026694
Magdalens, or of the Repentant Daughters. He must place his sister in	348.4644317149995
one of these, and we shall be in peace.”	312.41043573511024
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “till she comes out.”	355.35704850210936
“Ah, my faith!” said Athos, “you require too much, D’Artagnan. I have	397.6724372921851
given you all I have, and I beg leave to tell you that this is the	351.7839929856123
bottom of my sack.”	386.5876493462846
“But I think it would be still better,” said Aramis, “to inform the	487.39659952248144
queen and Lord de Winter at the same time.”	304.16345851038164
“Yes; but who is to carry the letter to Tours, and who to London?”	344.6155022119758
“I answer for Bazin,” said Aramis.	349.895147126597
“And I for Planchet,” said D’Artagnan.	348.0346118592115
“Ay,” said Porthos, “if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may.”	401.16149960419926
“To be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters,”	367.26747249429286
said Aramis. “Give the lackeys money, and they will start.”	391.7380077088328
“We will give them money?” replied Athos. “Have you any money?”	347.7198180412768
The four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows	423.4684452776538
which but lately had been so cheerful.	341.7335192954057
“Look out!” cried D’Artagnan, “I see black points and red points moving	385.8286043255429
yonder. Why did you talk of a regiment, Athos? It is a veritable army!”	470.71060947814544
“My faith, yes,” said Athos; “there they are. See the sneaks come,	448.97388633086075
without drum or trumpet. Ah, ah! have you finished, Grimaud?”	402.7866033020345
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies	458.9846242785136
which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. Some carried	351.89057937935024
arms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely	320.85919715512995
to be sword in hand.	325.3384423840947
“Bravo!” said Athos; “that does honor to your imagination.”	396.3813142144056
“All very well,” said Porthos, “but I should like to understand.”	303.2795125264145
“Let us decamp first, and you will understand afterward.”	427.8832583467292
“A moment, gentlemen, a moment; give Grimaud time to clear away the	401.1754363734036
breakfast.”	409.3556585339895
“Ah, ah!” said Aramis, “the black points and the red points are visibly	466.9061978069384
enlarging. I am of D’Artagnan’s opinion; we have no time to lose in	315.66485016240915
regaining our camp.”	474.5201116494378
“My faith,” said Athos, “I have nothing to say against a retreat. We	294.3726862860502
bet upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. Nothing can	349.0603667789659
be said; let us be off, gentlemen, let us be off!”	374.1716771677334
Grimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. The four	440.0692855981009
friends followed, ten paces behind him.	456.13371640289836
“What the devil shall we do now, gentlemen?” cried Athos.	340.8494007178032
“Have you forgotten anything?” said Aramis.	350.2324910445309
“The white flag, _morbleu!_ We must not leave a flag in the hands of	363.2329057900304
the enemy, even if that flag be but a napkin.”	475.37144105082064
And Athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off	476.0036921335299
the flag; but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range, they	415.10519176490806
opened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself	345.21127946108106
for pleasure’s sake.	349.1339838878586
But Athos might be said to bear a charmed life. The balls passed and	430.77021242556464
whistled all around him; not one struck him.	490.7919724621463
Athos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and	347.4941747126828
saluting those of the camp. On both sides loud cries arose—on the one	412.9963103330592
side cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.	372.2028165576398
A second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing	346.5104974195656
through it, made the napkin really a flag. Cries were heard from the	467.1927173559366
camp, “Come down! come down!”	340.30244199912414
Athos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him	391.76329199174904
returned with joy.	432.1240061673276
“Come along, Athos, come along!” cried D’Artagnan; “now we have found	300.89044175152975
everything except money, it would be stupid to be killed.”	453.75436413557054
But Athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his	453.6727701702351
companions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated	491.1936907779477
their pace by his.	409.60493085251557
Grimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the	446.7036936886831
balls.	425.583790186668
At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.	483.3977140072242
“What’s that?” asked Porthos, “what are they firing at now? I hear no	311.01433849167074
balls whistle, and I see nobody!”	318.1073818626258
“They are firing at the corpses,” replied Athos.	457.44563859335625
“But the dead cannot return their fire.”	294.78138206395676
“Certainly not! They will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will	440.4066127461363
deliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we	350.9030455042693
shall be out of the range of their balls. That renders it useless to	378.29719669190945
get a pleurisy by too much haste.”	424.0448407171697
“Oh, I comprehend now,” said the astonished Porthos.	399.0869115350694
“That’s lucky,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders.	388.58638024004654
On their part, the French, on seeing the four friends return at such a	455.97541382395434
step, uttered cries of enthusiasm.	319.8607735374006
At length a fresh discharge was heard, and this time the balls came	338.66787192385044
rattling among the stones around the four friends, and whistling	394.2739727479002
sharply in their ears. The Rochellais had at last taken possession of	319.76927932877106
the bastion.	326.2951236264306
“These Rochellais are bungling fellows,” said Athos; “how many have we	313.06051661057506
killed of them—a dozen?”	426.03590991119813
“Or fifteen.”	309.1338634652925
“How many did we crush under the wall?”	396.2840730200565
“Eight or ten.”	458.0390647928682
“And in exchange for all that not even a scratch! Ah, but what is the	294.19826562383156
matter with your hand, D’Artagnan? It bleeds, seemingly.”	304.48073635185125
“Oh, it’s nothing,” said D’Artagnan.	324.58045740425035
“A spent ball?”	350.77228563762213
“Not even that.”	424.9098621789991
“What is it, then?”	435.6410199716463
We have said that Athos loved D’Artagnan like a child, and this somber	435.98262575107344
and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young	353.42156776273737
man.	409.67536534058286
“Only grazed a little,” replied D’Artagnan; “my fingers were caught	403.6728465777695
between two stones—that of the wall and that of my ring—and the skin	320.58343685601443
was broken.”	330.4955263983327
“That comes of wearing diamonds, my master,” said Athos, disdainfully.	299.5781282105812
“Ah, to be sure,” cried Porthos, “there is a diamond. Why the devil,	448.4396700227787
then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?”	459.9258228055145
“Stop a bit!” said Aramis.	303.42165180017486
“Well thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.”	352.064598056557
“Undoubtedly,” said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos’s compliment;	296.87584900652325
“as there is a diamond, let us sell it.”	428.20773024625333
“But,” said D’Artagnan, “it is the queen’s diamond.”	364.9685895961236
“The stronger reason why it should be sold,” replied Athos. “The queen	389.8319048039047
saving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. The queen	467.5411966978635
saving us, her friends; nothing more moral. Let us sell the diamond.	445.63444174459767
What says Monsieur the Abbé? I don’t ask Porthos; his opinion has been	472.8664203694575
given.”	394.850981050984
“Why, I think,” said Aramis, blushing as usual, “that his ring not	312.4913337229303
coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,	339.47129589061404
D’Artagnan may sell it.”	386.0705440482183
“My dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified. Your advice,	306.70101778250097
then, is—”	491.8966712674954
“To sell the diamond,” replied Aramis.	357.24566409228305
“Well, then,” said D’Artagnan, gaily, “let us sell the diamond, and say	471.3277625703777
no more about it.”	332.6522655914738
The fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and	356.44974218819846
the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.	426.25324661622216
“My faith, it was time that idea came into Porthos’s head. Here we are	358.53589774084423
at the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. We	422.49292509205173
are observed; they are coming to meet us. We shall be carried in	430.10550953967265
triumph.”	384.9002357414482
In fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. More than two	452.56742979553155
thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but	486.9235108362127
wild undertaking of the four friends—an undertaking of which they were	297.1041982566623
far from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cries of	478.44389379815436
“Live the Musketeers! Live the Guards!” M. de Busigny was the first to	364.9317105010348
come and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was	475.4218067877863
lost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades	468.4956909147022
followed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but	382.01328853920336
felicitations, pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to	458.1815205692686
the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length	379.34413536819477
became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and	440.6094769692438
sent La Houdinière, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was	440.39149677856096
going on.	348.72740978232457
The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of	368.9904685402239
enthusiasm.	310.5137571469926
“Well?” asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdinière return.	305.81817447510235
“Well, monseigneur,” replied the latter, “three Musketeers and a	430.397953223822
Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and	399.19278109083416
breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held	421.40531644818935
it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don’t know how	453.85681030226203
many Rochellais.”	394.4741131468678
“Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?”	341.39773822026433
“Yes, monseigneur.”	465.061211938247
“What are their names?”	341.2682505156994
“Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.”	403.5238499962004
“Still my three brave fellows!” murmured the cardinal. “And the	306.5922835624932
Guardsman?”	444.2978251355957
“D’Artagnan.”	378.5490492226477
“Still my young scapegrace. Positively, these four men must be on my	454.30127817189964
side.”	372.6534367131745
The same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Tréville of the exploit of	383.6643979285047
the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. M. de Tréville, who	444.19581057947187
had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes	488.04978808619296
of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting	312.12190902579107
the episode of the napkin.	415.7942346155189
“That’s well, Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal; “pray let that	312.65740378313313
napkin be sent to me. I will have three _fleur-de-lis_ embroidered on	306.94628629119427
it in gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.”	310.63354582323984
“Monseigneur,” said M. de Tréville, “that will be unjust to the	448.0532604050689
Guardsmen. Monsieur d’Artagnan is not with me; he serves under Monsieur	485.6673633904415
Dessessart.”	295.9841713821945
“Well, then, take him,” said the cardinal; “when four men are so much	377.02935619428536
attached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the	320.02539180717605
same company.”	465.6389601638527
That same evening M. de Tréville announced this good news to the three	413.75564251191366
Musketeers and D’Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next	442.28968588320345
morning.	324.3002797252733
D’Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his	469.9414834124668
life had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise	461.1292843927256
greatly delighted.	373.1943578062036
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “you had a triumphant idea! As	372.77480991232005
you said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a	306.2509425351237
conversation of the highest importance.”	332.18724967919104
“Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the	351.4160160976745
help of God, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists.”	294.0622329662488
That evening D’Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart,	468.90401839178344
and inform him of his promotion.	439.8814590337266
M. Dessessart, who esteemed D’Artagnan, made him offers of help, as	350.5261020016061
this change would entail expenses for equipment.	310.9857545590805
D’Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged	373.0249357571546
him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to	359.28738164110445
turn it into money.	347.8575252680206
The next day, M. Dessessart’s valet came to D’Artagnan’s lodging, and	402.8776703515975
gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.	327.4088314783229
This was the price of the queen’s diamond.	357.03077222404886
Chapter XLVIII.	315.9222059982449
A FAMILY AFFAIR	363.4279781998503
Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not	314.8630427455606
subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned	364.5831678017348
nobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all	339.45117645668915
the world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, _family affair_.	343.2269676046102
Aramis had discovered the idea, _the lackeys_.	428.2957299057201
Porthos had discovered the means, _the diamond_.	345.58738809960533
D’Artagnan alone had discovered nothing—he, ordinarily the most	491.5041842572893
inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of	418.8952559664564
Milady paralyzed him.	337.17119949656205
Ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his	370.6893573430123
diamond.	351.07404120178893
The breakfast at M. de Tréville’s was as gay and cheerful as possible.	491.22651488829797
D’Artagnan already wore his uniform—for being nearly of the same size	331.08413141949654
as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who	369.96916289629075
purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold	452.37221128265594
his friend a complete outfit.	425.7714752175914
D’Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not	326.5176382110622
constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.	312.4456149034948
After breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the	317.1922101781797
evening at Athos’s lodging, and there finish their plans.	330.24813934952516
D’Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer’s uniform in	440.5560278755802
every street of the camp.	350.9118894410703
In the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only	297.066283179823
remained three things to decide—what they should write to Milady’s	469.76681090294187
brother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and	466.65220127016175
which should be the lackeys to carry the letters.	417.44723625673583
Everyone offered his own. Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud,	337.2503242703724
who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. Porthos	413.4532726761214
boasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash	338.4504408073493
four men of ordinary size. Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin,	414.3077314002335
made a pompous eulogium on his candidate. Finally, D’Artagnan had	341.93209600936524
entire faith in the bravery of Planchet, and reminded them of the	467.2988582211807
manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of	485.89766316723484
Boulogne.	403.42818916030467
These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave	468.4019863400388
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they	372.79605556164944
should be deemed too long.	307.8143437659045
“Unfortunately,” said Athos, “he whom we send must possess in himself	470.97942855264165
alone the four qualities united.”	446.79928481871934
“But where is such a lackey to be found?”	324.16244446918375
“Not to be found!” cried Athos. “I know it well, so take Grimaud.”	425.4573034737692
“Take Mousqueton.”	424.3127351112247
“Take Bazin.”	435.49991142719614
“Take Planchet. Planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities	377.3303593818552
out of the four.”	385.478806129904
“Gentlemen,” said Aramis, “the principal question is not to know which	457.65863245951135
of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most	439.95958446486316
clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves	315.4559374521634
money the best.”	355.03138612200826
“What Aramis says is very sensible,” replied Athos; “we must speculate	479.79638929258385
upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. Monsieur Abbé,	320.07170282033013
you are a great moralist.”	466.06539098553446
“Doubtless,” said Aramis, “for we not only require to be well served in	462.6739605694438
order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,	425.03865137505755
heads are in question, not for our lackeys—”	489.6675854900904
“Speak lower, Aramis,” said Athos.	415.0238080070812
“That’s wise—not for the lackeys,” resumed Aramis, “but for the	350.5443987031175
master—for the _masters_, we may say. Are our lackeys sufficiently	440.9647232377075
devoted to us to risk their lives for us? No.”	388.2287864558717
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan. “I would almost answer for Planchet.”	386.2596232247017
“Well, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of	409.77981422635713
money, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him	327.6770760125697
twice.”	395.28031412260736
“Why, good God! you will be deceived just the same,” said Athos, who	464.1824514141507
was an optimist when things were concerned, and a pessimist when men	375.0746875679559
were in question. “They will promise everything for the sake of the	332.74350692269826
money, and on the road fear will prevent them from acting. Once taken,	426.6382421477025
they will be pressed; when pressed, they will confess everything. What	449.77100006877095
the devil! we are not children. To reach England”—Athos lowered his	299.4422810346596
voice—“all France, covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal,	348.81030615789365
must be crossed. A passport for embarkation must be obtained; and the	413.8575126258832
party must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to	357.47876873468334
London. Really, I think the thing very difficult.”	474.4743557676236
“Not at all,” cried D’Artagnan, who was anxious the matter should be	487.73014957155044
accomplished; “on the contrary, I think it very easy. It would be, no	429.59322063182276
doubt, _parbleu_, if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast	486.82146094935933
importance, of the horrors of the cardinal—”	336.0225946953596
“Speak lower!” said Athos.	322.23712239592703
“—of intrigues and secrets of state,” continued D’Artagnan, complying	385.17610154296
with the recommendation. “There can be no doubt we would all be broken	344.781944789149
on the wheel; but for God’s sake, do not forget, as you yourself said,	449.71340792713204
Athos, that we only write to him concerning a family affair; that we	319.8164468353526
only write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London	425.024041715163
he will put it out of her power to injure us. I will write to him,	337.2494213873175
then, nearly in these terms.”	429.88091094771653
“Let us see,” said Athos, assuming in advance a critical look.	431.02390540062925
“_Monsieur and dear friend_—”	292.528719080488
“Ah, yes! _Dear friend_ to an Englishman,” interrupted Athos; “well	378.41692025521354
commenced! Bravo, D’Artagnan! Only with that word you would be	297.5420349766428
quartered instead of being broken on the wheel.”	484.54125510517014
“Well, perhaps. I will say, then, _Monsieur_, quite short.”	430.76852343302085
“You may even say, _My Lord_,” replied Athos, who stickled for	361.05455458960955
propriety.	405.7746137515544
“_My Lord, do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg?_”	443.7494414260275
“Good, _the Luxembourg!_ One might believe this is an allusion to the	401.48830707968364
queen-mother! That’s ingenious,” said Athos.	491.11407239445197
“Well, then, we will put simply, _My Lord, do you remember a certain	388.7869039562157
little enclosure where your life was spared?_”	314.9538628099981
“My dear D’Artagnan, you will never make anything but a very bad	418.14220012987755
secretary. _Where your life was spared!_ For shame! that’s unworthy. A	437.42762300818316
man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services. A benefit	370.4743840563433
reproached is an offense committed.”	321.25143719899387
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, “you are insupportable. If the letter	489.34338594595397
must be written under your censure, my faith, I renounce the task.”	393.00764302576863
“And you will do right. Handle the musket and the sword, my dear	471.85643621358724
fellow. You will come off splendidly at those two exercises; but pass	425.5742376559822
the pen over to Monsieur Abbé. That’s his province.”	398.28017716387467
“Ay, ay!” said Porthos; “pass the pen to Aramis, who writes theses in	305.37174165876064
Latin.”	424.38791730911635
“Well, so be it,” said D’Artagnan. “Draw up this note for us, Aramis;	428.50188474867514
but by our Holy Father the Pope, cut it short, for I shall prune you in	398.04685131952095
my turn, I warn you.”	312.4622321491464
“I ask no better,” said Aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence	364.77866996705063
which every poet has in himself; “but let me be properly acquainted	472.2737059715769
with the subject. I have heard here and there that this sister-in-law	370.9025993005018
was a hussy. I have obtained proof of it by listening to her	490.50692109618484
conversation with the cardinal.”	477.9511731627865
“Lower! _sacré bleu!_” said Athos.	417.4611726989156
“But,” continued Aramis, “the details escape me.”	417.3248490861499
“And me also,” said Porthos.	341.0873234449246
D’Artagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence. At	319.5088164701276
length Athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than	298.2955561118103
usual, made a sign of assent to D’Artagnan, who by it understood he was	371.73076085349214
at liberty to speak.	377.6732963619454
“Well, this is what you have to say,” said D’Artagnan: “_My Lord, your	457.0551287902511
sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that	403.09348720243474
she might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother,	324.5104327530704
being already married in France, and having been_—” D’Artagnan stopped,	296.69088424561744
as if seeking for the word, and looked at Athos.	420.6283209640326
“Repudiated by her husband,” said Athos.	307.93808683060513
“Because she had been branded,” continued D’Artagnan.	414.4265544133509
“Bah!” cried Porthos. “Impossible! What do you say—that she wanted to	442.37873942849023
have her brother-in-law killed?”	423.90709164604345
“Yes.”	297.9835005436198
“She was married?” asked Aramis.	486.4083680045609
“Yes.”	484.9602922863015
“And her husband found out that she had a _fleur-de-lis_ on her	429.28917582603043
shoulder?” cried Porthos.	314.007878439089
“Yes.”	367.62543836342957
These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder	378.58494123904524
intonation.	322.5670627412968
“And who has seen this _fleur-de-lis?_” inquired Aramis.	354.23590043162227
“D’Artagnan and I. Or rather, to observe the chronological order, I and	445.9236116849794
D’Artagnan,” replied Athos.	309.91190463894634
“And does the husband of this frightful creature still live?” said	330.259343672492
Aramis.	373.7213926131386
“He still lives.”	343.2357273321718
“Are you quite sure of it?”	398.88647585660317
“I am he.”	449.06881637685103
There was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected	297.09154000082646
according to his nature.	388.6798322932997
“This time,” said Athos, first breaking the silence, “D’Artagnan has	329.6040476858253
given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.”	385.2118810381817
“The devil! You are right, Athos,” said Aramis; “and it is a rather	477.1355094706755
difficult matter. The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write	434.97333924147927
such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very	410.6855307985607
readily. Never mind! Be silent, I will write.”	445.0439995568112
Aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote	343.7781438995019
eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a	347.53126515424134
voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he	428.91660070876696
read the following:	481.46681795797053
“My Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of	355.74559308921874
crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue d’Enfer. As	425.1496522354477
you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that	364.2554917772889
person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending	309.0874744594262
you important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a	311.86123252247216
near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are	430.64117620588615
ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was	411.32686087881507
already married in France. But the third time, which is the present,	466.7515187520821
you may succumb. Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the	450.319613412641
night. Watch her arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. If	447.01022215626983
you require to know positively what she is capable of, read her past	329.2526794559716
history on her left shoulder.”	490.93905895957
“Well, now that will do wonderfully well,” said Athos. “My dear Aramis,	344.79920967551186
you have the pen of a secretary of state. Lord de Winter will now be	305.5201854269935
upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should	306.6328076611399
fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. But	320.6220414081783
as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and	399.4041106006727
may stop at Châtellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised	424.42682855302587
him, with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other	414.03677172245443
half in exchange for the reply. Have you the diamond?” continued Athos.	395.4533161659347
“I have what is still better. I have the price;” and D’Artagnan threw	361.14787598603715
the bag upon the table. At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes	363.837501314847
and Porthos started. As to Athos, he remained unmoved.	320.0547710638298
“How much in that little bag?”	293.4429789098682
“Seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs.”	335.57586957560324
“Seven thousand livres!” cried Porthos. “That poor little diamond was	474.8225800916392
worth seven thousand livres?”	457.284914252091
“It appears so,” said Athos, “since here they are. I don’t suppose that	387.07912720122204
our friend D’Artagnan has added any of his own to the amount.”	488.48351302301944
“But, gentlemen, in all this,” said D’Artagnan, “we do not think of the	457.33836509151934
queen. Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear Buckingham.	326.3702442640031
That is the least we owe her.”	387.9307917645477
“That’s true,” said Athos; “but that concerns Aramis.”	422.0140452780572
“Well,” replied the latter, blushing, “what must I say?”	317.1570361259953
“Oh, that’s simple enough!” replied Athos. “Write a second letter for	294.1275741959617
that clever personage who lives at Tours.”	457.52311456709157
Aramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following	437.7999465920603
lines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his	300.6719846116143
friends.	316.77379128281046
“_My dear cousin_.”	360.4225232939409
“Ah, ah!” said Athos. “This clever person is your relative, then?”	449.8416738243293
“Cousin-german.”	327.7602107787059
“Go on, to your cousin, then!”	304.02142364245606
Aramis continued:	371.08284160990456
“MY DEAR COUSIN, His Eminence, the cardinal, whom God preserve for the	330.78348319278587
happiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is	448.8609906088134
on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle.	360.9319615627885
It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even	354.1799299981383
arrive in sight of the place. I will even venture to say that I am	482.9941163287524
certain M. de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some	306.09715346599387
great event. His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times	436.35220445019627
past, of times present, and probably of times to come. He would	387.3179102527312
extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him. Give these happy tidings	400.16161058609674
to your sister, my dear cousin. I have dreamed that the unlucky	382.3322949848299
Englishman was dead. I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by	478.11166633259154
poison; only of this I am sure, I have dreamed he was dead, and you	455.39833932595434
know my dreams never deceive me. Be assured, then, of seeing me soon	454.7551215739976
return.”	479.5588389218431
“Capital!” cried Athos; “you are the king of poets, my dear Aramis. You	419.31434522940856
speak like the Apocalypse, and you are as true as the Gospel. There is	344.44971086615357
nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter.”	350.8312433453242
“That is easily done,” said Aramis.	333.4388076593669
He folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:	374.54547593461353
“_To Mlle. Michon, seamstress, Tours_.”	485.43418551703905
The three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.	465.66660732497166
“Now,” said Aramis, “you will please to understand, gentlemen, that	324.32666934462765
Bazin alone can carry this letter to Tours. My cousin knows nobody but	445.6195283233502
Bazin, and places confidence in nobody but him; any other person would	461.2207031558272
fail. Besides, Bazin is ambitious and learned; Bazin has read history,	333.7276252358311
gentlemen, he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept	356.79898509854013
pigs. Well, as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself,	351.6314542562276
he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn, or at least a	292.8440769451478
cardinal. You can understand that a man who has such views will never	465.5683593990527
allow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather	408.0633424008343
than speak.”	485.6440389803428
“Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I consent to Bazin with all my heart,	438.5122251025539
but grant me Planchet. Milady had him one day turned out of doors, with	324.85747292359764
sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. Now, Planchet	491.71618874436535
has an excellent memory; and I will be bound that sooner than	466.5231595874414
relinquish any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be	420.2334184826609
beaten to death. If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements,	322.4493577821829
Aramis, those of London are mine. I request, then, that Planchet may be	372.02186983435547
chosen, more particularly as he has already been to London with me, and	307.3822376186318
knows how to speak correctly: _London, sir, if you please, and my	309.4563888824211
master, Lord D’Artagnan_. With that you may be satisfied he can make	338.6251067132227
his way, both going and returning.”	345.00161217444327
“In that case,” said Athos, “Planchet must receive seven hundred livres	435.5917075759178
for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and Bazin, three	448.8754529455215
hundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning—that	304.3077740020592
will reduce the sum to five thousand livres. We will each take a	337.9600276482208
thousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund	338.5943418266638
of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbé here, for	427.0657094767164
extraordinary occasions or common wants. Will that do?”	351.6101772202758
“My dear Athos,” said Aramis, “you speak like Nestor, who was, as	476.2791646226992
everyone knows, the wisest among the Greeks.”	292.04786314513285
“Well, then,” said Athos, “it is agreed. Planchet and Bazin shall go.	449.1788537022124
Everything considered, I am not sorry to retain Grimaud; he is	404.94521882652634
accustomed to my ways, and I am particular. Yesterday’s affair must	439.4359526437341
have shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite.”	371.44300388039466
Planchet was sent for, and instructions were given him. The matter had	446.4643746976342
been named to him by D’Artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the	379.6166699948027
money to him, then the glory, and then the danger.	457.62823298343613
“I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat,” said Planchet; “and	326.6048799308284
if I am taken I will swallow it.”	449.92695787861055
“Well, but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission,” said	397.7810918333546
D’Artagnan.	354.70573693614574
“You will give me a copy this evening, which I shall know by heart	301.9639369883155
tomorrow.”	460.36548427857747
D’Artagnan looked at his friends, as if to say, “Well, what did I tell	296.8251024907791
you?”	487.1566163194296
“Now,” continued he, addressing Planchet, “you have eight days to get	326.2712562591987
an interview with Lord de Winter; you have eight days to return—in all	360.4472029897774
sixteen days. If, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight	317.1814740368329
o’clock in the evening you are not here, no money—even if it be but	418.7433685009484
five minutes past eight.”	356.1474686707208
“Then, monsieur,” said Planchet, “you must buy me a watch.”	324.35658469548844
“Take this,” said Athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him	348.8637088355417
his own, “and be a good lad. Remember, if you talk, if you babble, if	436.5725541246412
you get drunk, you risk your master’s head, who has so much confidence	470.67091025876744
in your fidelity, and who answers for you. But remember, also, that if	416.1028452726744
by your fault any evil happens to D’Artagnan, I will find you, wherever	361.98862482320067
you may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly.”	487.3956837482444
“Oh, monsieur!” said Planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and	321.6735585168837
moreover, terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer.	400.42489590276045
“And I,” said Porthos, rolling his large eyes, “remember, I will skin	293.60772867706123
you alive.”	332.6294431819927
“Ah, monsieur!”	319.1163108219857
“And I,” said Aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, “remember that I	330.0570676974735
will roast you at a slow fire, like a savage.”	438.35257260443825
“Ah, monsieur!”	318.3907562343194
Planchet began to weep. We will not venture to say whether it was from	298.99603928833636
terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends	464.4160968220567
so closely united.	313.45668195315073
D’Artagnan took his hand. “See, Planchet,” said he, “these gentlemen	413.7564768135117
only say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like	433.27510377477256
you.”	474.21467148931373
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, “I will succeed or I will consent to be	373.87967567011646
cut in quarters; and if they do cut me in quarters, be assured that not	379.69082259628084
a morsel of me will speak.”	336.0696561351744
It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day, at eight	454.56313073955516
o’clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during	365.1344232789111
the night learn the letter by heart. He gained just twelve hours by	407.88736303371667
this engagement; he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight	323.4422796485278
o’clock in the evening.	311.98694885020603
In the morning, as he was mounting his horse, D’Artagnan, who felt at	301.26233163026035
the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took Planchet aside.	470.74749031955605
“Listen,” said he to him. “When you have given the letter to Lord de	439.44797072286735
Winter and he has read it, you will further say to him: _Watch over his	299.72069498863414
Grace Lord Buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him_. But this,	324.8607115603638
Planchet, is so serious and important that I have not informed my	491.56068467693484
friends that I would entrust this secret to you; and for a captain’s	460.30550798228217
commission I would not write it.”	461.6863965133401
“Be satisfied, monsieur,” said Planchet, “you shall see if confidence	466.79727289310676
can be placed in me.”	375.6120468925172
Mounted on an excellent horse, which he was to leave at the end of	335.6352407743216
twenty leagues in order to take the post, Planchet set off at a gallop,	325.3815757734345
his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the	452.7724990663836
Musketeers, but otherwise as light-hearted as possible.	458.2318745687275
Bazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for	402.7316816276814
performing his commission.	350.28682761775644
The four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may	368.8909609151263
well be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the	416.8159916165961
ear on the hark. Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all	424.8944572121104
that was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in	302.3703141846515
looking out for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an	390.6882622894874
involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected	393.0143696195114
service. They had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper	455.2522383404779
safety; Milady was a phantom which, when it had once appeared to	364.4837109806949
people, did not allow them to sleep very quietly.	333.68506471845313
On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling,	339.2437681407014
according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four	322.1173472465583
friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed	404.0067639940332
upon: “Monsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.”	440.559423960095
The four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done.	395.7253272122463
It is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part.	363.8878474369604
Aramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a	475.3522631751498
large, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography.	381.5055796472502
“Good God!” cried he, laughing, “I quite despair of my poor Michon; she	373.8104600608692
will never write like Monsieur de Voiture.”	321.00157278502303
“What does you mean by boor Michon?” said the Swiss, who was chatting	380.4531277322741
with the four friends when the letter came.	390.33927876370126
“Oh, _pardieu_, less than nothing,” said Aramis; “a charming little	447.885805959353
seamstress, whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few	355.8358185288665
lines as a sort of keepsake.”	404.9133449469774
“The duvil!” said the Swiss, “if she is as great a lady as her writing	454.75316342006215
is large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!”	384.24091455062074
Aramis read the letter, and passed it to Athos.	472.9184978352372
“See what she writes to me, Athos,” said he.	420.74823747127016
Athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the	345.79668915603645
suspicions that might have been created, read aloud:	308.035993770574
“MY COUSIN, My sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams, and	436.1503460718777
even entertain great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, I hope,	375.0714601702142
every dream is an illusion. Adieu! Take care of yourself, and act so	413.44529139235914
that we may from time to time hear you spoken of.	383.856352849207
“MARIE MICHON”	375.86059401774037
“And what dream does she mean?” asked the dragoon, who had approached	377.9724256935111
during the reading.	443.9072824339571
“Yez; what’s the dream?” said the Swiss.	371.6384712066908
“Well, _pardieu!_” said Aramis, “it was only this: I had a dream, and I	345.81245376759404
related it to her.”	417.22300212329685
“Yez, yez,” said the Swiss; “it’s simple enough to dell a dream, but I	478.46704698730343
neffer dream.”	445.9137714844181
“You are very fortunate,” said Athos, rising; “I wish I could say as	477.02417309872027
much!”	485.21807994904793
“Neffer,” replied the Swiss, enchanted that a man like Athos could envy	328.91894133648606
him anything. “Neffer, neffer!”	386.72891100295146
D’Artagnan, seeing Athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went	477.51779628665616
out.	339.1679257096481
Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the	465.06127487470417
dragoon and the Swiss.	315.21566081488135
As to Bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had	357.7144747791494
more imagination than the Swiss, he dreamed that Aramis, having become	349.09872346551884
pope, adorned his head with a cardinal’s hat.	405.31954466868547
But, as we have said, Bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed	401.80474869197997
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.	484.39904769373584
The days of expectation are long, and D’Artagnan, in particular, would	328.8020566631252
have wagered that the days were forty-four hours. He forgot the	393.181165130925
necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power	335.2595275194782
of Milady. He credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a	295.560985516185
demon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he	371.72204810515643
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that Planchet was being	352.1094326622479
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. Still	462.96242419501596
further, his confidence in the worthy Picard, at one time so great,	438.3847439246969
diminished day by day. This anxiety became so great that it even	417.6421554741922
extended to Aramis and Porthos. Athos alone remained unmoved, as if no	436.68916987161356
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary	455.20974884807174
atmosphere.	484.0035460610518
On the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in	393.9831955404474
D’Artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one	311.38712723334334
place, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was	417.4069291348086
expected.	425.7438952030012
“Really,” said Athos to them, “you are not men but children, to let a	471.16672579202657
woman terrify you so! And what does it amount to, after all? To be	444.1280150601321
imprisoned. Well, but we should be taken out of prison; Madame	313.64843322139757
Bonacieux was released. To be decapitated? Why, every day in the	439.1354793107044
trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that—for a	359.7558253723832
bullet may break a leg, and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more	486.5148823638674
pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head.	305.9127929886178
Wait quietly, then; in two hours, in four, in six hours at latest,	386.9096936808595
Planchet will be here. He promised to be here, and I have very great	463.8493428782609
faith in Planchet, who appears to me to be a very good lad.”	367.2340075318037
“But if he does not come?” said D’Artagnan.	349.8043681989032
“Well, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed,	365.9195617679869
that’s all. He may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper	389.5131386903801
from the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have	365.0637496223667
brought on a violent catarrh. Eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon	329.57132573562353
accidents! Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher	476.62367299889473
counts with a smile. Be philosophers, as I am, gentlemen; sit down at	454.7301010607157
the table and let us drink. Nothing makes the future look so bright as	443.88449571408336
surveying it through a glass of chambertin.”	446.38410940598266
“That’s all very well,” replied D’Artagnan; “but I am tired of fearing	362.5834561857049
when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of	362.4466393453855
Milady.”	347.0663661550052
“You are very fastidious,” said Athos; “such a beautiful woman!”	477.80053204334774
“A woman of mark!” said Porthos, with his loud laugh.	356.93296305099426
Athos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of	387.4628204175295
perspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous	313.2688809312102
movement he could not repress.	367.9540586026111
The day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but	365.8212073009201
finally it came. The bars were filled with drinkers. Athos, who had	469.48743734059997
pocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the Parpaillot. He had	304.74651521805276
found in M. de Busigny, who, by the by, had given them a magnificent	375.1123832583979
dinner, a partner worthy of his company. They were playing together, as	328.8345032110663
usual, when seven o’clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to	384.23293640106976
double the posts. At half past seven the retreat was sounded.	457.9933350429279
“We are lost,” said D’Artagnan, in the ear of Athos.	349.8481670031315
“You mean to say we _have lost_,” said Athos, quietly, drawing four	316.4910413199548
pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. “Come,	309.7682178735122
gentlemen,” said he, “they are beating the tattoo. Let us to bed!”	342.5603886621503
And Athos went out of the Parpaillot, followed by D’Artagnan. Aramis	419.3303427307534
came behind, giving his arm to Porthos. Aramis mumbled verses to	411.7522762816611
himself, and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his	401.64047923913057
mustache, in sign of despair.	381.5310351395919
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which	421.4035989718914
was familiar to D’Artagnan, and a well-known voice said, “Monsieur, I	422.98068622287974
have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening.”	432.77739983018785
“Planchet!” cried D’Artagnan, beside himself with joy.	416.70974669403415
“Planchet!” repeated Aramis and Porthos.	407.7522645462059
“Well, yes, Planchet, to be sure,” said Athos, “what is there so	405.2447215525831
astonishing in that? He promised to be back by eight o’clock, and eight	347.9741785900715
is striking. Bravo, Planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever	321.7309983057161
you leave your master, I will promise you a place in my service.”	409.48587849873945
“Oh, no, never,” said Planchet, “I will never leave Monsieur	423.88791799119997
d’Artagnan.”	419.1932097431112
At the same time D’Artagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his	297.27408253360073
hand.	404.56827181951314
D’Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had	296.97074411054035
embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of	315.89261744555154
affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear	366.3440130683225
extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.	312.2908110258277
“I have the note,” said he to Athos and to his friends.	490.97184311326475
“That’s well,” said Athos, “let us go home and read it.”	447.8507370591867
The note burned the hand of D’Artagnan. He wished to hasten their	401.69730062115883
steps; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the	370.34868328856317
young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend.	385.87431768264065
At length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood	382.11250462317776
at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised,	358.7906596000247
D’Artagnan, with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so	297.8603754287303
anxiously expected letter.	438.08379649185133
It contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a	294.1193513248277
conciseness as perfectly Spartan:	305.8697763327454
_Thank you; be easy_.	379.8834051678547
D’Artagnan translated this for the others.	353.0803456699306
Athos took the letter from the hands of D’Artagnan, approached the	477.82941440974923
lamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to	314.5828325357362
a cinder.	346.76123823142757
Then, calling Planchet, he said, “Now, my lad, you may claim your seven	336.9613635575434
hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as	479.3589116358402
that.”	339.06199342579487
“I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it,” said	348.9903559746285
Planchet.	411.92730303025024
“Well!” cried D’Artagnan, “tell us all about it.”	442.26964832683814
“_Dame_, that’s a long job, monsieur.”	434.4855405980001
“You are right, Planchet,” said Athos; “besides, the tattoo has been	404.43631321044336
sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much	332.68834501174047
longer than the others.”	382.69757586452107
“So be it,” said D’Artagnan. “Go to bed, Planchet, and sleep soundly.”	321.33051283872305
“My faith, monsieur! that will be the first time I have done so for	326.6421074528914
sixteen days.”	308.51836092056834
“And me, too!” said D’Artagnan.	373.9512663698119
“And me, too!” said Porthos.	322.7386745001446
“And me, too!” said Aramis.	336.15142988359065
“Well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!” said Athos.	294.9353418355346
Chapter XLIX.	358.1598355393626
FATALITY	421.25609183235633
Meantime Milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness	470.7738730005417
that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea	468.7001074317484
that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the	381.0776381834071
thought that she had been insulted by D’Artagnan, threatened by Athos,	323.98471547285044
and that she had quit France without being revenged on them. This idea	343.55074994301697
soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever	490.6859691740722
terrible consequences might result to herself from it, she implored the	324.1788613151762
captain to put her on shore; but the captain, eager to escape from his	436.01946774408725
false position—placed between French and English cruisers, like the bat	434.8723095912378
between the mice and the birds—was in great haste to regain England,	344.78607259074136
and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman’s caprice,	315.80283988187864
promising his passenger, who had been particularly recommended to him	479.60261003798496
by the cardinal, to land her, if the sea and the French permitted him,	374.9659640006083
at one of the ports of Brittany, either at Lorient or Brest. But the	465.9272962689223
wind was contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore. Nine	340.0197236645363
days after leaving the Charente, pale with fatigue and vexation, Milady	398.4514727780221
saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear.	460.307570391754
She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the	361.1063722330916
cardinal it would take her at least three days. Add another day for	297.9463750530101
landing, and that would make four. Add these four to the nine others,	434.70949838858735
that would be thirteen days lost—thirteen days, during which so many	463.68639472201
important events might pass in London. She reflected likewise that the	295.87323064998685
cardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more	470.1833701344067
disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the	436.1348707687456
accusations she brought against others.	457.04858350208076
She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her	399.99571631970855
request to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her	452.52753727089146
of it. Milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day that	490.85368508438023
Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France, the messenger of his	339.6819056760302
Eminence entered the port in triumph.	437.4164545135791
All the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement. Four large	337.877933509303
vessels, recently built, had just been launched. At the end of the	350.2708854141036
jetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary	372.7618711113776
with him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with a	470.07818465235925
white feather which drooped upon his shoulder, Buckingham was seen	321.13679446324096
surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.	320.5953808519077
It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England	437.6871885673306
remembers that there is a sun. The star of day, pale but nevertheless	404.3432021806146
still splendid, was setting in the horizon, glorifying at once the	326.6694543604292
heavens and the sea with bands of fire, and casting upon the towers and	466.9155346219785
the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows	360.75934666952946
sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration. Breathing that sea	441.8725103695696
breeze, so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is	308.09018855868953
approached, contemplating all the power of those preparations she was	350.02477427706236
commissioned to destroy, all the power of that army which she was to	324.9064551824049
combat alone—she, a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared	378.71228068612754
herself mentally to Judith, the terrible Jewess, when she penetrated	303.21336841511993
the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots,	302.79537233459376
horses, men, and arms, which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate	355.2311864099299
like a cloud of smoke.	298.3454074251479
They entered the roadstead; but as they drew near in order to cast	323.6719766159656
anchor, a little cutter, looking like a coastguard formidably armed,	455.4359603758867
approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which	353.839111702168
directed its course to the ladder. This boat contained an officer, a	406.27278041285246
mate, and eight rowers. The officer alone went on board, where he was	296.1791842205157
received with all the deference inspired by the uniform.	458.0904190707653
The officer conversed a few instants with the captain, gave him several	406.4147139682636
papers, of which he was the bearer, to read, and upon the order of the	470.56772969140013
merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel, both passengers and	404.5455312229217
sailors, were called upon deck.	483.7459990690402
When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the	457.98088828643637
point of the brig’s departure, its route, its landings; and to all	392.4032512886512
these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	379.2526571419776
hesitation. Then the officer began to pass in review all the people,	460.99424191422105
one after the other, and stopping when he came to Milady, surveyed her	376.4500510950442
very closely, but without addressing a single word to her.	335.82170022961924
He then returned to the captain, said a few words to him, and as if	469.5507867542711
from that moment the vessel was under his command, he ordered a	319.794513564641
maneuver which the crew executed immediately. Then the vessel resumed	412.20080891827
its course, still escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by	419.753845214821
side with it, menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon. The boat	435.05226543182187
followed in the wake of the ship, a speck near the enormous mass.	349.5544523467253
During the examination of Milady by the officer, as may well be	307.73298483733333
imagined, Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances.	361.36379287783944
But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in	389.95305809900367
reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine, she met	341.43846888452686
this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery	415.8174469207263
followed her investigation. The officer who had stopped in front of her	450.3462662846517
and studied her with so much care might have been twenty-five or	295.27202281392096
twenty-six years of age. He was of pale complexion, with clear blue	409.6304804071958
eyes, rather deeply set; his mouth, fine and well cut, remained	325.56693595899435
motionless in its correct lines; his chin, strongly marked, denoted	357.3358130349989
that strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes	470.028820348545
mostly nothing but obstinacy; a brow a little receding, as is proper	307.79974431902696
for poets, enthusiasts, and soldiers, was scarcely shaded by short thin	336.3665814661556
hair which, like the beard which covered the lower part of his face,	376.1499049611779
was of a beautiful deep chestnut color.	343.48420157092175
When they entered the port, it was already night. The fog increased the	440.15311336510985
darkness, and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a	352.64170423386
circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to	438.87497148347506
become rainy. The air they breathed was heavy, damp, and cold.	413.1136451044938
Milady, that woman so courageous and firm, shivered in spite of	294.53857969013944
herself.	398.65917917120686
The officer desired to have Milady’s packages pointed out to him, and	388.1114217945684
ordered them to be placed in the boat. When this operation was	354.50184873565433
complete, he invited her to descend by offering her his hand.	299.7599069814815
Milady looked at this man, and hesitated. “Who are you, sir,” asked	345.24270195976453
she, “who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my	484.01289301449725
account?”	402.95209001276197
“You may perceive, madame, by my uniform, that I am an officer in the	442.268428882891
English navy,” replied the young man.	447.73913355537576
“But is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place	334.79355466065124
themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in	377.7188667364231
a port of Great Britain, and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct	429.39108858334816
them ashore?”	461.9023789622745
“Yes, madame, it is the custom, not from gallantry but prudence, that	467.34906169176713
in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels, in	411.92196766820496
order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full	445.98876644132616
information can be obtained about them.”	446.98586597399697
These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most	449.6177285322175
perfect calmness. Nevertheless, they had not the power of convincing	426.89232438941127
Milady.	361.04787180104927
“But I am not a foreigner, sir,” said she, with an accent as pure as	379.9161117326767
ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester; “my name is Lady	301.4408660963348
Clarik, and this measure—”	484.6785880899152
“This measure is general, madame; and you will seek in vain to evade	380.08007750668946
it.”	401.29420897903674
“I will follow you, then, sir.”	433.2026120286961
Accepting the hand of the officer, she began the descent of the ladder,	480.9084916508184
at the foot of which the boat waited. The officer followed her. A large	440.59042374947387
cloak was spread at the stern; the officer requested her to sit down	299.07725626483864
upon this cloak, and placed himself beside her.	316.9791742615184
“Row!” said he to the sailors.	470.80762320060785
The eight oars fell at once into the sea, making but a single sound,	453.7108087134586
giving but a single stroke, and the boat seemed to fly over the surface	491.1011766691162
of the water.	487.4814582911084
In five minutes they gained the land.	419.9808501465962
The officer leaped to the pier, and offered his hand to Milady. A	399.1186519956503
carriage was in waiting.	299.1284626982822
“Is this carriage for us?” asked Milady.	303.0591975903993
“Yes, madame,” replied the officer.	485.59162747586254
“The hôtel, then, is far away?”	330.8157131593948
“At the other end of the town.”	378.20767274470836
“Very well,” said Milady; and she resolutely entered the carriage.	343.02190116553913
The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the	403.3590201633358
carriage; and this operation ended, he took his place beside Milady,	468.70527166030456
and shut the door.	378.3778446478836
Immediately, without any order being given or his place of destination	477.6650915449228
indicated, the coachman set off at a rapid pace, and plunged into the	407.18142544885796
streets of the city.	469.99437248760466
So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for	365.0326663518849
reflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all	383.09080606894867
disposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage,	462.68400589979797
and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which	427.27022888984726
presented themselves to her mind.	404.2491925799802
At the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of	403.27631494457773
the journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was	333.5297501709076
being conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in	412.71577092554014
the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady	480.9190914374448
shuddered.	464.5986937543411
“But we are no longer in the city, sir,” said she.	380.9545011527296
The young officer preserved silence.	488.0377688942094
“I beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me	334.3692606346154
whither you are taking me.”	312.368271963572
This threat brought no reply.	470.1117117095429
“Oh, this is too much,” cried Milady. “Help! help!”	383.2050559809239
No voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with	366.87229476725287
rapidity; the officer seemed a statue.	304.77129852154707
Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions	439.9042151958329
peculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their	446.6585233649469
effect; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness.	365.1455203130819
The young man remained immovable.	300.27461852177123
Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out.	449.7676656215315
“Take care, madame,” said the young man, coolly, “you will kill	477.11599480710447
yourself in jumping.”	435.3438638936753
Milady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at	466.5229951029705
her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before	314.65833406248396
so beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful	424.08077098541156
creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing	341.12118488783426
him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a	319.073097897066
complaining voice said: “In the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is	460.99082684518703
to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to	373.5122063385091
attribute the violence that is done me?”	375.96617485092895
“No violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is	375.7657655539026
the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with	488.83943466040535
all who land in England.”	477.4288740489453
“Then you don’t know me, sir?”	456.90161406020053
“It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.”	449.3736711314893
“And on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?”	473.90675015427394
“None, I swear to you.”	296.16830665118766
There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of	332.34012564102363
the young man, that Milady felt reassured.	387.3159198492178
At length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped	357.3543537184339
before an iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe	397.3635138698894
in form, massive, and isolated. Then, as the wheels rolled over a fine	295.4659195224776
gravel, Milady could hear a vast roaring, which she at once recognized	387.68414463226463
as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff.	417.4649477540124
The carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped in	335.40516177528644
a court large, dark, and square. Almost immediately the door of the	425.89613506437445
carriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented his	335.6766946592047
hand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with	336.13029162598895
tolerable calmness.	482.9817794813945
“Still, then, I am a prisoner,” said Milady, looking around her, and	406.22303187169626
bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer;	384.1400834818467
“but I feel assured it will not be for long,” added she. “My own	410.17314523881436
conscience and your politeness, sir, are the guarantees of that.”	476.32200372819176
However flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but	364.1247888768391
drawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use	413.123948590616
in ships of war, he whistled three times, with three different	458.6196976834893
modulations. Immediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the	401.45845358631016
smoking horses, and put the carriage into a coach house.	426.6362348315911
Then the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner	448.40146768373427
to enter the house. She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his	374.2317389284107
arm, and passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted	313.4704434970446
passage, lighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase	383.29409850639826
around an angle of stone. They then came to a massive door, which after	356.0924753659883
the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried	479.1207374582757
with him, turned heavily upon its hinges, and disclosed the chamber	294.2220643340342
destined for Milady.	409.1488694156026
With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest	447.2332763628375
details. It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a	415.15627083270135
prisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts	429.96875623105797
at the door decided the question in favor of the prison.	442.0091833712387
In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature, though drawn	426.85888649496997
from the most vigorous sources, abandoned her; she sank into a large	327.8850758655783
easy chair, with her arms crossed, her head lowered, and expecting	425.07137425210266
every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her.	377.66033731036754
But no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks	483.98920760001107
and packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.	328.3400282855566
The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness	434.66203589804843
Milady had constantly seen in him, never pronouncing a word himself,	480.4453697253065
and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his	304.9933196711235
whistle.	433.4247013175183
It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken	431.1210266652365
language did not exist, or had become useless.	387.81000547101434
At length Milady could hold out no longer; she broke the silence. “In	435.38571850121616
the name of heaven, sir,” cried she, “what means all that is passing?	474.89496583532775
Put an end to my doubts; I have courage enough for any danger I can	416.01085100557333
foresee, for every misfortune which I understand. Where am I, and why	375.4695652370858
am I here? If I am free, why these bars and these doors? If I am a	382.2346281479051
prisoner, what crime have I committed?”	328.6112396499084
“You are here in the apartment destined for you, madame. I received	370.96233961424383
orders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you to	419.8011252438796
this castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the	491.03915720282
exactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman.	304.7939277703968
There terminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to	386.07821727550106
fulfill toward you; the rest concerns another person.”	338.5762881200895
“And who is that other person?” asked Milady, warmly. “Can you not tell	411.4780932234987
me his name?”	310.7551434652853
At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some	339.5075169052885
voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep	461.24801767312226
approached the door.	428.42883084394566
“That person is here, madame,” said the officer, leaving the entrance	458.9334149076144
open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.	454.07776512529904
At the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He	418.85939633517523
was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in	440.216315136018
his hand.	447.71593222573
Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported	311.7709341695361
herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head	459.86740299102473
as if to meet a certainty.	335.71660809474804
The stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into	302.4873041676802
the circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew	374.3555833607268
back.	425.10740351504415
Then when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor,	411.85819443675894
“What, my brother, is it you?”	394.95178482370864
“Yes, fair lady!” replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous,	469.7423425319304
half ironical; “it is I, myself.”	402.0317430323955
“But this castle, then?”	403.32867624685105
“Is mine.”	338.535063439465
“This chamber?”	330.3736058235526
“Is yours.”	355.8865897596977
“I am, then, your prisoner?”	334.1974791238531
“Nearly so.”	451.40261150274887
“But this is a frightful abuse of power!”	350.13665995546467
“No high-sounding words! Let us sit down and chat quietly, as brother	476.2006174261717
and sister ought to do.”	410.27982382087254
Then, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was	425.2334834201689
waiting for his last orders, he said. “All is well, I thank you; now	428.9362761276017
leave us alone, Mr. Felton.”	423.63200384475886
Chapter L.	409.9149314004509
CHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER	323.76940157428714
During the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door, close a	436.0730118052006
shutter, and draw a chair near to his sister-in-law’s _fauteuil_,	372.5266204745913
Milady, anxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of	299.24183630828554
possibility, and discovered all the plan, of which she could not even	314.7336579559526
obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had	489.49699559485646
fallen. She knew her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold	417.3559741001633
hunter, an intrepid player, enterprising with women, but by no means	484.7015702132302
remarkable for his skill in intrigues. How had he discovered her	298.47908778667136
arrival, and caused her to be seized? Why did he detain her?	370.8073369172688
Athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had	293.68246968108457
with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not	446.9086091168473
suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. She	459.90643075135506
rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been	438.6989022495859
discovered. Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut	444.0351925193595
off the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery; but	485.4004692028055
Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman,	402.5073210719253
particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of	462.3730607954517
jealousy.	474.42948623045993
This supposition appeared to her most reasonable. It seemed to her that	372.0163912751151
they wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future. At	324.5651981323038
all events, she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands	366.8203810699126
of her brother-in-law, with whom she reckoned she could deal very	403.4078765915665
easily, rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent	334.5808941594118
enemy.	317.34728284283403
“Yes, let us chat, brother,” said she, with a kind of cheerfulness,	449.5950444856354
decided as she was to draw from the conversation, in spite of all the	313.2010257522664
dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring, the revelations of which she	470.94847189277414
stood in need to regulate her future conduct.	477.18171398215975
“You have, then, decided to come to England again,” said Lord de	313.79860693133446
Winter, “in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris	321.93935066789754
never to set your feet on British ground?”	310.87054572067285
Milady replied to this question by another question. “To begin with,	347.44402639567676
tell me,” said she, “how have you watched me so closely as to be aware	367.65624631879416
beforehand not only of my arrival, but even of the day, the hour, and	459.4749427458862
the port at which I should arrive?”	435.65054135786227
Lord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady, thinking that as his	437.93047900590955
sister-in-law employed them they must be the best.	471.8954498133578
“But tell me, my dear sister,” replied he, “what makes you come to	355.35373077651064
England?”	307.0003670341739
“I come to see you,” replied Milady, without knowing how much she	324.22895797801107
aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which D’Artagnan’s letter	463.23402328353217
had given birth in the mind of her brother-in-law, and only desiring to	432.44618524904865
gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood.	425.9907539817997
“Ah, to see me?” said de Winter, cunningly.	402.3904852016911
“To be sure, to see you. What is there astonishing in that?”	490.4399037923229
“And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me?”	450.7506764158253
“No.”	344.01958915387223
“So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the	395.8587792704243
Channel?”	312.2553123243723
“For you alone.”	421.30161312770935
“The deuce! What tenderness, my sister!”	337.00621953186476
“But am I not your nearest relative?” demanded Milady, with a tone of	344.9354978579113
the most touching ingenuousness.	353.25812345432513
“And my only heir, are you not?” said Lord de Winter in his turn,	426.65469050515196
fixing his eyes on those of Milady.	394.5870454900106
Whatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting;	404.60561878182955
and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand	387.9243508980118
upon the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.	393.33411984807935
In fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred	359.45288881867896
to Milady’s mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she	395.2867780394802
had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which	348.10957763968037
she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant.	436.3783930585007
She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon	415.4762006580662
D’Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.	422.59580246953897
“I do not understand, my Lord,” said she, in order to gain time and	452.5190339607889
make her adversary speak out. “What do you mean to say? Is there any	325.4056966136417
secret meaning concealed beneath your words?”	457.5020190453371
“Oh, my God, no!” said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature. “You	344.9119594831848
wish to see me, and you come to England. I learn this desire, or rather	418.06129382642575
I suspect that you feel it; and in order to spare you all the	318.0958873802744
annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of	459.08548933520945
landing, I send one of my officers to meet you, I place a carriage at	361.60976875939446
his orders, and he brings you hither to this castle, of which I am	296.84908883365154
governor, whither I come every day, and where, in order to satisfy our	484.0531548957624
mutual desire of seeing each other, I have prepared you a chamber. What	491.1112345540341
is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what	332.9837628821525
you have told me?”	399.6324112105671
“No; what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming.”	470.59981730074276
“And yet that is the most simple thing in the world, my dear sister.	337.3992827402663
Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on	349.4714983730281
entering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to	418.547945202224
enter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of	363.6877805511426
his voyagers? I am commandant of the port. They brought me that book. I	434.93298691799345
recognized your name in it. My heart told me what your mouth has just	299.0846182755356
confirmed—that is to say, with what view you have exposed yourself to	408.00624242052373
the dangers of a sea so perilous, or at least so troublesome at this	438.5518861037773
moment—and I sent my cutter to meet you. You know the rest.”	481.4667004470324
Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied, and she was the more alarmed.	348.6996954951444
“My brother,” continued she, “was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I	302.7654991881667
saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived?”	438.7964442771617
“Himself. Ah, I can understand how the sight of him struck you,”	405.3963582513254
replied Lord de Winter. “You came from a country where he must be very	324.0196307163936
much talked of, and I know that his armaments against France greatly	421.0026078153528
engage the attention of your friend the cardinal.”	369.1149196029112
“My friend the cardinal!” cried Milady, seeing that on this point as on	318.68241207500427
the other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed.	313.64086230509747
“Is he not your friend?” replied the baron, negligently. “Ah, pardon! I	376.5339207120064
thought so; but we will return to my Lord Duke presently. Let us not	381.0141157780011
depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken. You came,	323.93204178385446
you say, to see me?”	323.224203953315
“Yes.”	302.38063293106643
“Well, I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes,	442.87902071020903
and that we shall see each other every day.”	297.53855997045946
“Am I, then, to remain here eternally?” demanded Milady, with a certain	371.2104418557659
terror.	485.8983411986019
“Do you find yourself badly lodged, sister? Demand anything you want,	485.2458309650275
and I will hasten to have you furnished with it.”	300.8508419451806
“But I have neither my women nor my servants.”	455.80929022032103
“You shall have all, madame. Tell me on what footing your household was	347.37475790946394
established by your first husband, and although I am only your	418.8729357391956
brother-in-law, I will arrange one similar.”	483.3075427415739
“My first husband!” cried Milady, looking at Lord de Winter with eyes	309.9017991682385
almost starting from their sockets.	489.82466339774555
“Yes, your French husband. I don’t speak of my brother. If you have	456.4847160158263
forgotten, as he is still living, I can write to him and he will send	378.86681285307634
me information on the subject.”	383.5966332856183
A cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady.	377.2152700853897
“You jest!” said she, in a hollow voice.	328.6392203762893
“Do I look so?” asked the baron, rising and going a step backward.	296.8816939174761
“Or rather you insult me,” continued she, pressing with her stiffened	422.4695832771549
hands the two arms of her easy chair, and raising herself upon her	413.6553308299507
wrists.	296.64546535937694
“I insult you!” said Lord de Winter, with contempt. “In truth, madame,	353.6644686793034
do you think that can be possible?”	409.9820730183933
“Indeed, sir,” said Milady, “you must be either drunk or mad. Leave the	422.801474221366
room, and send me a woman.”	353.3707540054494
“Women are very indiscreet, my sister. Cannot I serve you as a waiting	449.46478947872765
maid? By that means all our secrets will remain in the family.”	346.77596730216084
“Insolent!” cried Milady; and as if acted upon by a spring, she bounded	295.8347305823235
toward the baron, who awaited her attack with his arms crossed, but	293.0668186939318
nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword.	446.52922683264654
“Come!” said he. “I know you are accustomed to assassinate people; but	477.1488470605249
I warn you I shall defend myself, even against you.”	359.05559813658454
“You are right,” said Milady. “You have all the appearance of being	458.3406568002721
cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman.”	455.2857214219255
“Perhaps so; and I have an excuse, for mine would not be the first hand	378.8394747455858
of a man that has been placed upon you, I imagine.”	387.2560534215892
And the baron pointed, with a slow and accusing gesture, to the left	352.31607905216543
shoulder of Milady, which he almost touched with his finger.	420.1398045937681
Milady uttered a deep, inward shriek, and retreated to a corner of the	373.06143224316787
room like a panther which crouches for a spring.	394.21115312992606
“Oh, growl as much as you please,” cried Lord de Winter, “but don’t try	399.28398586873686
to bite, for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage. There	398.00267708933495
are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand. There is	418.479811249299
no knight-errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the	471.79927832059775
fair lady I detain a prisoner; but I have judges quite ready who will	322.0449058645328
quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide, a bigamist, into	326.92445292205366
the bed of Lord de Winter, my brother. And these judges, I warn you,	403.4350390498152
will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders	343.4030333426249
alike.”	470.7540380387483
The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and	412.37601043258434
armed before an unarmed woman, he felt the chill of fear glide through	448.95277858119647
his whole frame. However, he continued all the same, but with	398.47793638459905
increasing warmth: “Yes, I can very well understand that after having	418.8604324666517
inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you	393.3422094387597
to be my heir likewise; but know beforehand, if you kill me or cause me	484.25219397662556
to be killed, my precautions are taken. Not a penny of what I possess	472.9239617141876
will pass into your hands. Were you not already rich enough—you who	450.59359602582725
possess nearly a million? And could you not stop your fatal career, if	311.65392044968456
you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it? Oh,	344.26900147332447
be assured, if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me, you	444.0199163115341
should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at	389.1773366427685
Tyburn. I will be silent, but you must endure your captivity quietly.	413.5711145675921
In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the	431.00838521303183
army; but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart	454.604313959316
will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south. And be	471.71038318503906
assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains	487.1651030266604
out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the	354.6932288957889
Continent.”	297.7674063889117
Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes.	389.1843871793027
“Yes, at present,” continued Lord de Winter, “you will remain in this	409.1612891822535
castle. The walls are thick, the doors strong, and the bars solid;	427.89124972842234
besides, your window opens immediately over the sea. The men of my	460.4997083441107
crew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this	426.6303298854316
apartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even	482.2976700095944
if you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you	343.1822757103167
to pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your	390.52491864277965
part, denoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If	367.5253155041107
they kill you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for	461.4921786367594
having saved it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness,	316.2308531935566
your countenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself:	328.5025196317621
‘Fifteen days, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that	298.3509491767511
is expired some idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I	439.97442227177123
shall meet with a victim. Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be	386.3990343618711
away from here.’ Ah, try it!”	393.96472381489383
Milady, finding her thoughts betrayed, dug her nails into her flesh to	378.9910529411924
subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	474.4734432647782
agony.	320.0306261444173
Lord de Winter continued: “The officer who commands here in my absence	350.89081900445143
you have already seen, and therefore know him. He knows how, as you	292.42164298523994
must have observed, to obey an order—for you did not, I am sure, come	438.85271053053816
from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak. What do	317.1223195680518
you say of him? Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and	414.3607126858394
more mute? You have already tried the power of your seductions upon	299.04866964228734
many men, and unfortunately you have always succeeded; but I give you	487.1652997041739
leave to try them upon this one. _Pardieu!_ if you succeed with him, I	339.6473886290488
pronounce you the demon himself.”	408.6498770153491
He went toward the door and opened it hastily.	346.6345305714713
“Call Mr. Felton,” said he. “Wait a minute longer, and I will introduce	340.4909476322344
him to you.”	382.6875208937714
There followed between these two personages a strange silence, during	455.32440751264255
which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching.	419.68260883680244
Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor, and the	316.17281011472403
young lieutenant, with whom we are already acquainted, stopped at the	417.9772577465378
threshold to receive the orders of the baron.	390.2009896231169
“Come in, my dear John,” said Lord de Winter, “come in, and shut the	349.77242464595497
door.”	474.8064563316234
The young officer entered.	341.46965020575925
“Now,” said the baron, “look at this woman. She is young; she is	406.13127692809815
beautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a	372.2687384002087
monster, who, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many	303.30076145424346
crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals.	341.1961084122046
Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a	477.07006758572584
bait to her victims; her body even pays what she promises—I must do her	395.15159668857916
that justice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill	476.3947507024305
you. I have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be	391.23106577271994
named lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I	431.97583166831845
am for you not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor,	371.838622311
but a father. This woman has come back again into England for the	325.0011432100577
purpose of conspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands.	388.02872541683394
Well, I call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard	293.0967716265015
me, and more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by	328.9578760605571
your hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she	333.8330078197467
has merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith	473.45493475855733
in your loyalty!”	386.17495228800607
“My Lord,” said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance	427.53946366144567
all the hatred he could find in his heart, “my Lord, I swear all shall	420.25403181473985
be done as you desire.”	322.38885804659503
Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to	358.01028233593655
imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which	417.21452780645717
prevailed on her beautiful countenance. Lord de Winter himself could	452.7811607139681
scarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared	436.6271013759894
apparently for a fight.	452.9329994873135
“She is not to leave this chamber, understand, John,” continued the	362.7322436476185
baron. “She is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but	377.03255330537
you—if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.”	295.59536450317853
“That is sufficient, my Lord! I have sworn.”	428.21660078489197
“And now, madame, try to make your peace with God, for you are judged	312.09530216133373
by men!”	365.1177652256305
Milady let her head sink, as if crushed by this sentence. Lord de	404.68279050929743
Winter went out, making a sign to Felton, who followed him, shutting	381.44897325798644
the door after him.	311.5788389235589
One instant after, the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel	338.9740556210504
was heard in the corridor—his ax in his girdle and his musket on his	293.08778783051275
shoulder.	360.56770022428435
Milady remained for some minutes in the same position, for she thought	386.31452056257575
they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole; she then	476.8169055209301
slowly raised her head, which had resumed its formidable expression of	320.785708286713
menace and defiance, ran to the door to listen, looked out of her	444.6843408711592
window, and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair, she	342.64206632621426
reflected.	325.073515549223
Chapter LI.	395.27542679972476
OFFICER	423.11154365495895
Meanwhile, the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England; but no	460.15164659773984
news arrived that was not annoying and threatening.	393.5560664141003
Although La Rochelle was invested, however certain success might	306.25589514238004
appear—thanks to the precautions taken, and above all to the dyke,	465.4052720630796
which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city—the	323.6338948462863
blockade might last a long time yet. This was a great affront to the	412.6040299909864
king’s army, and a great inconvenience to the cardinal, who had no	486.667049414035
longer, it is true, to embroil Louis XIII. with Anne of Austria—for that	467.9605672971593
affair was over—but he had to adjust matters for M. de Bassompierre,	354.20333155400834
who was embroiled with the Duc d’Angoulême.	473.7412672238777
As to Monsieur, who had begun the siege, he left to the cardinal the	462.6460477454782
task of finishing it.	346.3807195230455
The city, notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor, had	371.7235543504519
attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender; the mayor had hanged the	392.4747532683193
mutineers. This execution quieted the ill-disposed, who resolved to	472.5986079065034
allow themselves to die of hunger—this death always appearing to them	488.9541002339288
more slow and less sure than strangulation.	414.86125923222994
On their side, from time to time, the besiegers took the messengers	308.41308927099794
which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham, or the spies which Buckingham	438.1293298294147
sent to the Rochellais. In one case or the other, the trial was soon	428.65524837385715
over. The cardinal pronounced the single word, “Hanged!” The king was	339.4343124033086
invited to come and see the hanging. He came languidly, placing himself	293.9394907828903
in a good situation to see all the details. This amused him sometimes a	403.2663750869461
little, and made him endure the siege with patience; but it did not	320.1487538627808
prevent his getting very tired, or from talking at every moment of	481.97252454891077
returning to Paris—so that if the messengers and the spies had failed,	457.5469737419937
his Eminence, notwithstanding all his inventiveness, would have found	480.54205520763514
himself much embarrassed.	314.57767298890735
Nevertheless, time passed on, and the Rochellais did not surrender. The	441.4893155207882
last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter. This letter told	373.20622190574727
Buckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding,	386.18317404120245
“If your succor does not arrive within fifteen days, we will	333.9941502646626
surrender,” it added, quite simply, “If your succor comes not within	462.4147027783662
fifteen days, we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes.”	466.1136866530269
The Rochellais, then, had no hope but in Buckingham. Buckingham was	335.32357704753986
their Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively	314.8228582184012
that they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with	422.9679606156915
their hope.	339.3798388289965
The cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from	352.23777876147267
England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come.	472.6555203743826
The question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in	423.5756638016518
the council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place,	402.4578322981482
La Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said,	420.7940261197043
very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which	465.8755315079097
Frenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement of	403.0560129497037
sixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that	300.5595642586345
period what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La	331.9729519753086
Rochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who	488.09299011778126
allowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628,	305.66216154583907
the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this	315.89955775620433
extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good	350.3129622334958
Catholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging	372.7216581766822
generals—La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.	310.80855121310935
The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of	316.50250876232553
his terrible emissary—for he comprehended the strange qualities of this	396.7285653046485
woman, sometimes a serpent, sometimes a lion. Had she betrayed him? Was	344.232364364051
she dead? He knew her well enough in all cases to know that, whether	336.12757946719825
acting for or against him, as a friend or an enemy, she would not	319.4277195875703
remain motionless without great impediments; but whence did these	359.1526121515019
impediments arise? That was what he could not know.	306.19063726913186
And yet he reckoned, and with reason, on Milady. He had divined in the	475.3941450456656
past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could	420.9320089237536
cover; and he felt, from one cause or another, that this woman was his	440.65209582645593
own, as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior	421.676639613896
to the danger which threatened her.	312.7390655399783
He resolved, then, to carry on the war alone, and to look for no	388.8497729921673
success foreign to himself, but as we look for a fortunate chance. He	411.95664535833293
continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve	491.5931535991739
La Rochelle. Meanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city,	440.7642429434045
which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and	432.01000473560725
recalling the saying of Louis XI., his political predecessor, as he	438.34790124609117
himself was the predecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of	312.53374136680316
Tristan’s gossip: “Divide in order to reign.”	451.1978872532469
Henry IV., when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown over	419.7023137452272
the walls. The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he	378.36320225937925
represented to the Rochellais how unjust, selfish, and barbarous was	419.34265609512863
the conduct of their leaders. These leaders had corn in abundance, and	402.9412392618297
would not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim—for they,	433.88520721749853
too, had maxims—that it was of very little consequence that women,	352.9218395133721
children, and old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend	437.3148259813171
the walls remained strong and healthy. Up to that time, whether from	427.79083342598057
devotedness or from want of power to act against it, this maxim,	306.02990968548323
without being generally adopted, nevertheless passed from theory into	365.93690562908625
practice; but the notes did it injury. The notes reminded the men that	395.06873930879743
the children, women, and old men whom they allowed to die were their	463.8821670861821
sons, their wives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just	328.5145505646563
for everyone to be reduced to the common misery, in order that equal	470.8751732016801
conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions.	357.0663211468787
These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect, in	465.2757715524287
that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private	453.9747460031931
negotiations with the royal army.	361.6739556766702
But at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing	489.7498494440607
fruit, and applauded himself for having put it in action, an inhabitant	407.91032287443056
of La Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines—God knows how,	429.7501251955614
such was the watchfulness of Bassompierre, Schomberg, and the Duc	448.55240009140846
d’Angoulême, themselves watched over by the cardinal—an inhabitant of	375.3519120244816
La Rochelle, we say, entered the city, coming from Portsmouth, and	299.8347316512992
saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight	398.70349841000814
days. Still further, Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length	410.53531096128535
the great league was about to declare itself against France, and that	411.80346949738407
the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English, Imperial, and	327.8937005426699
Spanish armies. This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city.	363.7418188302423
Copies were put up at the corners of the streets; and even they who had	342.67733543173836
begun to open negotiations interrupted them, being resolved to await	304.76423060892967
the succor so pompously announced.	336.951867878925
This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieu’s former anxiety,	381.7153613690356
and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the	360.92402574474846
other side of the sea.	463.81431017489683
During this time, exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief,	489.63663044338404
the royal army led a joyous life, neither provisions nor money being	422.8512007380839
wanting in the camp. All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and	424.19105069833824
gaiety. To take spies and hang them, to make hazardous expeditions upon	434.44807045443247
the dyke or the sea, to imagine wild plans, and to execute them	478.49248452837026
coolly—such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short	451.7056249837087
which were not only so long to the Rochellais, a prey to famine and	412.8093496103961
anxiety, but even to the cardinal, who blockaded them so closely.	427.03213618651546
Sometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest	293.97062123976184
_gendarme_ of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so	387.9477582612219
slowly keeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from	394.11460609595963
all the corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a	431.24243256135605
Musketeer of the company of Tréville, he drew near and looked at him in	464.83840528195526
a peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four	341.6969128243772
companions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in	333.7959000442112
another direction.	294.3861338085976
One day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind, without hope in	490.4086384403273
the negotiations with the city, without news from England, the cardinal	485.34770001630284
went out, without any other aim than to be out of doors, and	421.1022459955725
accompanied only by Cahusac and La Houdinière, strolled along the	447.2259216545874
beach. Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the	293.6937003160138
ocean, he came, his horse going at a foot’s pace, to a hill from the	412.2681435060671
top of which he perceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and	403.4722399246273
catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this	408.46487544514434
period of the year, seven men surrounded by empty bottles. Four of	457.8262550015489
these men were our Musketeers, preparing to listen to a letter one of	309.3604834355879
them had just received. This letter was so important that it made them	323.43778269544543
forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead.	328.3904409514473
The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of	341.56938952005567
Collicure wine; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen.	375.92168375326196
The cardinal was, as we have said, in very low spirits; and nothing	403.18920223262865
when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as	300.5817389119228
gaiety in others. Besides, he had another strange fancy, which was	418.292845956268
always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of	387.74389130270566
others. Making a sign to La Houdinière and Cahusac to stop, he alighted	373.92639323307765
from his horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions,	453.9984875325256
hoping, by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and	401.9138328212027
of the hedge which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this	420.9439252934331
conversation which appeared so interesting. At ten paces from the hedge	354.165382667042
he recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived	330.5060884871483
that these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others	343.6128855112604
were those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and	472.4528418467277
Aramis.	394.08729518407097
It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was	471.89807143442
augmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and	304.7393810645694
with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had	407.80216964947056
not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any	352.52419470461325
positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and	326.87198490287
attracted the attention of the Musketeers.	483.6368071369924
“Officer!” cried Grimaud.	319.6408995749169
“You are speaking, you scoundrel!” said Athos, rising upon his elbow,	364.88880441365825
and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look.	355.3171668554538
Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself	432.0837766264692
with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge,	402.94234288147675
announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort.	382.10104695631577
With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with	466.73660165727114
respect.	296.4915700847923
The cardinal seemed furious.	424.94173343169587
“It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,” said he. “Are	377.0034583073773
the English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves	422.7414371020052
superior officers?”	320.048463087145
“Monseigneur,” replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone had	332.4808805341043
preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him,	368.87821385850077
“Monseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their	375.3706238284617
duty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior	487.01567791976123
officers to their lackeys.”	406.589030720552
“Lackeys?” grumbled the cardinal. “Lackeys who have the order to warn	430.4402171586861
their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys, they are sentinels.”	322.1040772714912
“Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution,	368.7855366366994
we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting	443.86596427554815
you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done	355.81641328872064
us in uniting us. D’Artagnan,” continued Athos, “you, who but lately	469.9172777161776
were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude	300.5761213507393
to Monseigneur, here it is; avail yourself of it.”	330.66931065071526
These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which	351.9957944944766
distinguished Athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive	362.0939283247987
politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic	384.2463372173935
than kings by birth.	475.68200009894537
D’Artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude	308.23404175253313
which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal.	463.95809568549885
“It does not signify, gentlemen,” continued the cardinal, without	371.81638890668006
appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the	473.2767902286788
diversion which Athos had started, “it does not signify, gentlemen. I	469.7661764591072
do not like to have simple soldiers, because they have the advantage of	358.6756431460866
serving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline	434.8416126588396
is the same for them as for everybody else.”	455.4726382753547
Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and bowed	476.3564988451005
in sign of assent. Then he resumed in his turn: “Discipline,	414.4998826946734
Monseigneur, has, I hope, in no way been forgotten by us. We are not on	423.2011895059162
duty, and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to	292.73446638360855
dispose of our time as we pleased. If we are so fortunate as to have	339.3955448584194
some particular duty to perform for your Eminence, we are ready to obey	428.1850772165999
you. Your Eminence may perceive,” continued Athos, knitting his brow,	395.8725202848268
for this sort of investigation began to annoy him, “that we have not	486.66697344985454
come out without our arms.”	370.7289714658323
And he showed the cardinal, with his finger, the four muskets piled	317.13810844639926
near the drum, on which were the cards and dice.	353.20273040586346
“Your Eminence may believe,” added D’Artagnan, “that we would have come	360.2648007138886
to meet you, if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward	309.98932494389607
us with so few attendants.”	394.0286902011352
The cardinal bit his mustache, and even his lips a little.	459.6766289535873
“Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and	340.8060870129186
guarded by your lackeys?” said the cardinal. “You look like four	454.0803852108522
conspirators.”	381.1580722529783
“Oh, as to that, Monseigneur, it is true,” said Athos; “we do conspire,	351.9307472154835
as your Eminence might have seen the other morning. Only we conspire	462.7682251692953
against the Rochellais.”	469.0737783451566
“Ah, you gentlemen of policy!” replied the cardinal, knitting his brow	323.74041347178047
in his turn, “the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found	450.3711856074543
in your brains, if we could read them as you read that letter which you	469.32602110937853
concealed as soon as you saw me coming.”	339.2872865206959
The color mounted to the face of Athos, and he made a step toward his	476.3623393413809
Eminence.	372.7721169885272
“One might think you really suspected us, monseigneur, and we were	358.5189382414443
undergoing a real interrogatory. If it be so, we trust your Eminence	376.2498611947003
will deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be	448.7247957904292
acquainted with our real position.”	429.84624673924463
“And if it were an interrogatory!” replied the cardinal. “Others	310.4962104146992
besides you have undergone such, Monsieur Athos, and have replied	328.05537774441143
thereto.”	383.75259262005005
“Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us, and we	394.8107499264754
are ready to reply.”	439.35244431689506
“What was that letter you were about to read, Monsieur Aramis, and	346.3861970394426
which you so promptly concealed?”	449.06573694357473
“A woman’s letter, monseigneur.”	421.8862858185655
“Ah, yes, I see,” said the cardinal; “we must be discreet with this	353.4662723629429
sort of letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and	334.82155423872985
you know I have taken orders.”	434.4625815554375
“Monseigneur,” said Athos, with a calmness the more terrible because he	307.94300089281177
risked his head in making this reply, “the letter is a woman’s letter,	401.1079100540685
but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme, nor Madame d’Aiguillon.”	404.84104654986663
The cardinal became as pale as death; lightning darted from his eyes.	382.6389413539201
He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdinière. Athos	468.8966283496212
saw the movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the	369.36377422603215
other three friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to	482.18845824975017
allow themselves to be taken. The cardinalists were three; the	405.74088664270306
Musketeers, lackeys included, were seven. He judged that the match	345.94571460401323
would be so much the less equal, if Athos and his companions were	465.70890771021936
really plotting; and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at	344.8961690973715
command, all his anger faded away into a smile.	468.03741829680627
“Well, well!” said he, “you are brave young men, proud in daylight,	338.50744941998266
faithful in darkness. We can find no fault with you for watching over	471.7307302103774
yourselves, when you watch so carefully over others. Gentlemen, I have	322.7135206797214
not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red	488.31127884924365
Dovecot. If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am	391.4760076632348
going, I would request you to accompany me; but as there is none,	366.9716883447369
remain where you are, finish your bottles, your game, and your letter.	430.591738705264
Adieu, gentlemen!”	370.34051562377715
And remounting his horse, which Cahusac led to him, he saluted them	348.2347808281031
with his hand, and rode away.	296.1075346907512
The four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their	433.7266833990084
eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. Then they	413.03475769237303
looked at one another.	449.297553955516
The countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding	300.7319918248251
the friendly adieu of his Eminence, they plainly perceived that the	482.58094066608976
cardinal went away with rage in his heart.	343.2645685296425
Athos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.	459.921222169995
When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, “That Grimaud kept bad	372.31863463851136
watch!” cried Porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his	300.07294797646523
ill-humor on somebody.	390.97798012476585
Grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. Athos lifted his finger,	319.87164880930607
and Grimaud was silent.	458.79339502939865
“Would you have given up the letter, Aramis?” said D’Artagnan.	354.89066105327834
“I,” said Aramis, in his most flutelike tone, “I had made up my mind.	369.5571008745256
If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him, I would have	339.2133361732747
presented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other I would	481.1326525709861
have run my sword through his body.”	377.9863029201183
“I expected as much,” said Athos; “and that was why I threw myself	338.99445539482133
between you and him. Indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking	323.193496074877
thus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but	433.90473315846214
women and children.”	292.08222337190426
“My dear Athos, I admire you, but nevertheless we were in the wrong,	373.29225085294945
after all.”	393.44888296171314
“How, in the wrong?” said Athos. “Whose, then, is the air we breathe?	369.3609103563972
Whose is the ocean upon which we look? Whose is the sand upon which we	479.55605547467223
were reclining? Whose is that letter of your mistress? Do these belong	433.714371420557
to the cardinal? Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to	302.71915032114276
him. There you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. One might	369.1690623412306
have supposed the Bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic	440.762683544023
Medusa had converted you into stone. Is being in love conspiring? You	438.98197306410316
are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up,	475.0217651428302
and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. That’s a	392.98177485186915
match you are playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game. Why	313.73280809599044
should you expose your game to your adversary? That is never done. Let	392.93331822643586
him find it out if he can! We can find out his!”	423.86736176088556
“Well, that’s all very sensible, Athos,” said D’Artagnan.	438.53030034810195
“In that case, let there be no more question of what’s past, and let	362.62280887341706
Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	393.5186523808351
him.”	319.39603776167985
Aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded	309.6974846244824
him, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.	362.1504265033495
“You had only read a line or two,” said D’Artagnan; “read the letter	309.3009452685474
again from the commencement.”	437.1317957282956
“Willingly,” said Aramis.	456.65672207171076
“MY DEAR COUSIN, I think I shall make up my mind to set out for	384.2754599852882
Béthune, where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent	486.8820493005409
of the Carmelites; this poor child is quite resigned, as she knows she	405.75600819326166
cannot live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in	342.6773128076635
danger. Nevertheless, if the affairs of our family are arranged, as we	299.35822830134305
hope they will be, I believe she will run the risk of being damned, and	452.0086222670624
will return to those she regrets, particularly as she knows they are	404.4270319867798
always thinking of her. Meanwhile, she is not very wretched; what she	312.6520731968375
most desires is a letter from her intended. I know that such viands	382.385691346278
pass with difficulty through convent gratings; but after all, as I have	351.7074706717648
given you proofs, my dear cousin, I am not unskilled in such affairs,	444.6291600342995
and I will take charge of the commission. My sister thanks you for your	327.1181401639488
good and eternal remembrance. She has experienced much anxiety; but she	451.9623760964853
is now at length a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in	296.39669057130766
order that nothing may happen unexpectedly.	333.794787775666
    “Adieu, my dear cousin. Tell us news of yourself as often as you	294.0560184694513
    can; that is to say, as often as you can with safety. I embrace	352.7867809949169
    you.	303.3965016898902
“MARIE MICHON”	336.4721749747609
“Oh, what do I not owe you, Aramis?” said D’Artagnan. “Dear Constance!	360.5591438955703
I have at length, then, intelligence of you. She lives; she is in	478.3751992726603
safety in a convent; she is at Béthune! Where is Béthune, Athos?”	351.1759699017264
“Why, upon the frontiers of Artois and of Flanders. The siege once	341.46014270081173
over, we shall be able to make a tour in that direction.”	465.89414251177914
“And that will not be long, it is to be hoped,” said Porthos; “for they	471.3994855055813
have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were	460.5473818305627
reduced to the leather of their shoes. Supposing that after having	329.664185758753
eaten the leather they eat the soles, I cannot see much that is left	426.7342690209855
unless they eat one another.”	474.90395730368124
“Poor fools!” said Athos, emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine	324.86267557532057
which, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,	438.3411843274984
merited it no less, “poor fools! As if the Catholic religion was not	456.010454521277
the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions! All the	307.7343087936029
same,” resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate,	452.7516467248165
“they are brave fellows! But what the devil are you about, Aramis?”	470.6741833126755
continued Athos. “Why, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!”	303.210697542434
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “Athos is right, it must be burned. And yet if	337.9854754800184
we burn it, who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to	316.7044701987427
interrogate ashes?”	418.88945059159363
“He must have one,” said Athos.	422.3493735379699
“What will you do with the letter, then?” asked Porthos.	490.4191644511528
“Come here, Grimaud,” said Athos. Grimaud rose and obeyed. “As a	467.9745210070213
punishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will	391.0432852988096
please to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the	342.4522783581475
service you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass	381.44228340002496
of wine. First, here is the letter. Eat heartily.”	441.89334313796206
Grimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held	448.20201373208454
in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then	461.36223870291985
swallowed it.	337.6311720090749
“Bravo, Monsieur Grimaud!” said Athos; “and now take this. That’s well.	369.0022139278275
We dispense with your saying grace.”	472.43030986138024
Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine; but his eyes,	456.55981361330424
raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language	357.051656057635
which, though mute, was not the less expressive.	326.765291320793
“And now,” said Athos, “unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the	376.7247756287554
ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud, I think we may be pretty much at	432.7626928033081
our ease respecting the letter.”	308.81607372146993
Meantime, his Eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring between	370.84012777435737
his mustaches, “These four men must positively be mine.”	427.92490774719727
Chapter LII.	349.8758823537332
CAPTIVITY: THE FIRST DAY	375.4606856028719
Let us return to Milady, whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France	294.42955898384446
has made us lose sight of for an instant.	390.08289918551236
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left	490.85563960291313
her, plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection—a dark hell at the gate	346.5771804568311
of which she has almost left hope behind, because for the first time	434.9593108697196
she doubts, for the first time she fears.	355.070206445836
On two occasions her fortune has failed her, on two occasions she has	391.51757374493576
found herself discovered and betrayed; and on these two occasions it	369.50140411494556
was to one fatal genius, sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her,	324.27336834711866
that she has succumbed. D’Artagnan has conquered her—her, that	438.53508934279716
invincible power of evil.	408.6166876960766
He has deceived her in her love, humbled her in her pride, thwarted her	366.9261824916198
in her ambition; and now he ruins her fortune, deprives her of liberty,	318.4133902066457
and even threatens her life. Still more, he has lifted the corner of	296.9243938270992
her mask—that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered	371.8107100157915
her so strong.	482.0007581479558
D’Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham, whom she hates as she	446.5168416868647
hates everyone she has loved, the tempest with which Richelieu	381.64444794005567
threatened him in the person of the queen. D’Artagnan had passed	352.41176381035996
himself upon her as De Wardes, for whom she had conceived one of those	303.97452934946483
tigerlike fancies common to women of her character. D’Artagnan knows	329.2835055432958
that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without	489.4890529875283
dying. In short, at the moment in which she has just obtained from	490.3660417191057
Richelieu a _carte blanche_ by the means of which she is about to take	322.50287122118516
vengeance on her enemy, this precious paper is torn from her hands, and	372.16142983318497
it is D’Artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to	419.16123705575353
some filthy Botany Bay, some infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean.	353.0928723627568
All this she owes to D’Artagnan, without doubt. From whom can come so	457.31877703052004
many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him? He alone could	473.262001647844
have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he	463.0899299868802
has discovered, one after another, by a train of fatalities. He knows	367.80206682930566
her brother-in-law. He must have written to him.	346.5869547279476
What hatred she distills! Motionless, with her burning and fixed	417.91737435198786
glances, in her solitary apartment, how well the outbursts of passion	434.6959529455181
which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her	410.7449793446292
respiration, accompany the sound of the surf which rises, growls,	299.88511181368625
roars, and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against	391.42976829392484
the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle! How many	440.62802781229414
magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the	359.5561401899043
flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme.	411.7393452327816
Bonacieux, against Buckingham, but above all against	438.3742984287426
D’Artagnan—projects lost in the distance of the future.	465.8729523706042
Yes; but in order to avenge herself she must be free. And to be free, a	482.2034760099109
prisoner has to pierce a wall, detach bars, cut through a floor—all	328.10080617272763
undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish, but before	306.38072362580425
which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way. Besides, to do	489.1138055802641
all this, time is necessary—months, years; and she has ten or twelve	310.2939589353896
days, as Lord de Winter, her fraternal and terrible jailer, has told	392.3102430352821
her.	301.73089415611025
And yet, if she were a man she would attempt all this, and perhaps	482.4172682893752
might succeed; why, then, did heaven make the mistake of placing that	451.3269892927461
manlike soul in that frail and delicate body?	384.6557509045434
The first moments of her captivity were terrible; a few convulsions of	322.10144762143653
rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to	411.340935133994
nature. But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion;	425.88408690402525
and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared, and she	446.96809064309195
remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose.	438.1524673298657
“Go to, go to! I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away	306.5596006682521
so,” says she, gazing into the glass, which reflects back to her eyes	453.4159551500417
the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself. “No	469.2300795226637
violence; violence is the proof of weakness. In the first place, I have	336.19947157699596
never succeeded by that means. Perhaps if I employed my strength	367.7364852513188
against women I might perchance find them weaker than myself, and	353.5652719652677
consequently conquer them; but it is with men that I struggle, and I am	461.4739912005029
but a woman to them. Let me fight like a woman, then; my strength is in	459.86648608102064
my weakness.”	405.5324118977934
Then, as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could	390.50203686608353
place upon her countenance, so mobile and so expressive, she made it	353.5012438973884
take all expressions from that of passionate anger, which convulsed her	436.15433070509687
features, to that of the most sweet, most affectionate, and most	460.994167092389
seducing smile. Then her hair assumed successively, under her skillful	375.80310558961776
hands, all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her	398.5739128293631
face. At length she murmured, satisfied with herself, “Come, nothing is	442.0529318924314
lost; I am still beautiful.”	453.7990222646904
It was then nearly eight o’clock in the evening. Milady perceived a	306.269735274029
bed; she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only	294.1969152247016
refresh her head and her ideas, but still further, her complexion. A	325.04608103979945
better idea, however, came into her mind before going to bed. She had	386.49479923820513
heard something said about supper. She had already been an hour in this	378.13083344456106
apartment; they could not long delay bringing her a repast. The	381.50350364829745
prisoner did not wish to lose time; and she resolved to make that very	449.5499663965385
evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to	447.5741242932918
work upon, by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship	453.4807980378574
she was committed.	333.0331979485109
A light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance	346.37555458591794
of her jailers. Milady, who had arisen, threw herself quickly into the	357.59363124856594
armchair, her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and	444.834326608885
disheveled, her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace, one hand on	329.34038060975473
her heart, and the other hanging down.	399.91720316374597
The bolts were drawn; the door groaned upon its hinges. Steps sounded	346.25419124237885
in the chamber, and drew near.	396.8738025743052
“Place that table there,” said a voice which the prisoner recognized as	323.2722689297131
that of Felton.	436.8754507593129
The order was executed.	450.89333346649676
“You will bring lights, and relieve the sentinel,” continued Felton.	355.9306340508301
And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same	454.9744526955138
individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her	436.360043369575
guards; that is to say, soldiers.	469.30802889288327
Felton’s orders were, for the rest, executed with a silent rapidity	334.7523055796434
that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline.	377.61748337412195
At length Felton, who had not yet looked at Milady, turned toward her.	334.44733665781087
“Ah, ah!” said he, “she is asleep; that’s well. When she wakes she can	315.29133186050313
sup.” And he made some steps toward the door.	372.3099708062795
“But, my lieutenant,” said a soldier, less stoical than his chief, and	423.3629101265815
who had approached Milady, “this woman is not asleep.”	375.72353195414644
“What, not asleep!” said Felton; “what is she doing, then?”	324.8601322588701
“She has fainted. Her face is very pale, and I have listened in vain; I	481.84987878079335
do not hear her breathe.”	460.6368936452242
“You are right,” said Felton, after having looked at Milady from the	357.5523302384153
spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her. “Go and tell	355.3084782729357
Lord de Winter that his prisoner has fainted—for this event not having	398.00437817239754
been foreseen, I don’t know what to do.”	325.370924650322
The soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer. Felton sat down	430.98556805144983
upon an armchair which happened to be near the door, and waited without	372.8739546733974
speaking a word, without making a gesture. Milady possessed that great	309.7557874114501
art, so much studied by women, of looking through her long eyelashes	340.47640239554937
without appearing to open the lids. She perceived Felton, who sat with	332.1007913710389
his back toward her. She continued to look at him for nearly ten	470.68711166378023
minutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned	399.1874133883692
round once.	379.3499473984873
She then thought that Lord de Winter would come, and by his presence	332.7906950071718
give fresh strength to her jailer. Her first trial was lost; she acted	433.9761325065799
like a woman who reckons up her resources. As a result she raised her	323.9444167942307
head, opened her eyes, and sighed deeply.	491.6703231131414
At this sigh Felton turned round.	471.6497406456164
“Ah, you are awake, madame,” he said; “then I have nothing more to do	467.1743266073295
here. If you want anything you can ring.”	413.18161740197434
“Oh, my God, my God! how I have suffered!” said Milady, in that	483.10604079907404
harmonious voice which, like that of the ancient enchantresses, charmed	387.43007223646777
all whom she wished to destroy.	440.42195632844937
And she assumed, upon sitting up in the armchair, a still more graceful	329.64278669556325
and abandoned position than when she reclined.	357.71450505992607
Felton arose.	425.97128752322544
“You will be served, thus, madame, three times a day,” said he. “In the	379.5555719394864
morning at nine o’clock, in the day at one o’clock, and in the evening	490.8863073469139
at eight. If that does not suit you, you can point out what other hours	377.24122851569535
you prefer, and in this respect your wishes will be complied with.”	324.3544775592893
“But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?”	487.90721749110173
asked Milady.	362.1120271164966
“A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for, who will be tomorrow	394.21401047807944
at the castle, and will return as often as you desire her presence.”	334.38305417320544
“I thank you, sir,” replied the prisoner, humbly.	459.03804558541447
Felton made a slight bow, and directed his steps toward the door. At	315.11285145457333
the moment he was about to go out, Lord de Winter appeared in the	334.6771251886298
corridor, followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of	430.3418208440816
the swoon of Milady. He held a vial of salts in his hand.	359.2506191438186
“Well, what is it—what is going on here?” said he, in a jeering voice,	374.8628227101778
on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out. “Is this	315.9203081841505
corpse come to life already? Felton, my lad, did you not perceive that	320.12964986892064
you were taken for a novice, and that the first act was being performed	380.7890656318798
of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following	386.30877564657277
out all the developments?”	315.6039876712589
“I thought so, my lord,” said Felton; “but as the prisoner is a woman,	488.84762302476213
after all, I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle	315.06834249452396
birth owes to a woman, if not on her account, at least on my own.”	397.2781251940304
Milady shuddered through her whole system. These words of Felton’s	483.1663236172381
passed like ice through her veins.	346.04891789697916
“So,” replied de Winter, laughing, “that beautiful hair so skillfully	490.46034822725863
disheveled, that white skin, and that languishing look, have not yet	315.94623941609814
seduced you, you heart of stone?”	356.61624698600383
“No, my Lord,” replied the impassive young man; “your Lordship may be	413.57659258165756
assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman	294.9317174843043
to corrupt me.”	382.2440808562762
“In that case, my brave lieutenant, let us leave Milady to find out	465.055306909059
something else, and go to supper; but be easy! She has a fruitful	372.7594682324544
imagination, and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps	454.9233773096399
after the first.”	415.65212592592366
And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of	350.55075447479027
Felton, and led him out, laughing.	474.896663680982
“Oh, I will be a match for you!” murmured Milady, between her teeth;	472.9265725010416
“be assured of that, you poor spoiled monk, you poor converted soldier,	383.92572965934187
who has cut his uniform out of a monk’s frock!”	440.28101357627656
“By the way,” resumed de Winter, stopping at the threshold of the door,	484.2289969878874
“you must not, Milady, let this check take away your appetite. Taste	414.4368971436265
that fowl and those fish. On my honor, they are not poisoned. I have a	455.23984641051766
very good cook, and he is not to be my heir; I have full and perfect	439.1805617430564
confidence in him. Do as I do. Adieu, dear sister, till your next	358.4341465635648
swoon!”	384.9836054943042
This was all that Milady could endure. Her hands clutched her armchair;	360.8267047484111
she ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door	448.82808002432887
as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was	344.9751268680696
alone a fresh fit of despair seized her. She cast her eyes upon the	399.54841405738557
table, saw the glittering of a knife, rushed toward it and clutched it;	306.3081947865929
but her disappointment was cruel. The blade was round, and of flexible	308.0945018603433
silver.	322.6922242302377
A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill-closed	415.79794554455293
door, and the door reopened.	433.5817989895419
“Ha, ha!” cried Lord de Winter; “ha, ha! Don’t you see, my brave	463.41463438595827
Felton; don’t you see what I told you? That knife was for you, my lad;	411.2778355717893
she would have killed you. Observe, this is one of her peculiarities,	482.0257650423214
to get rid thus, after one fashion or another, of all the people who	472.2566109449945
bother her. If I had listened to you, the knife would have been pointed	309.7355214707099
and of steel. Then no more of Felton; she would have cut your throat,	389.7174640451128
and after that everybody else’s. See, John, see how well she knows how	382.2998831141405
to handle a knife.”	346.86177471518533
In fact, Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand;	471.5907062889022
but these last words, this supreme insult, relaxed her hands, her	452.7332121357456
strength, and even her will. The knife fell to the ground.	469.6056040803861
“You were right, my Lord,” said Felton, with a tone of profound disgust	404.7576649586675
which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady, “you were	488.82466218703564
right, my Lord, and I was wrong.”	386.85217575724755
And both again left the room.	367.45463198816276
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first, and she	382.6053897523493
heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor.	443.4913233245784
“I am lost,” murmured she; “I am lost! I am in the power of men upon	436.3879104323069
whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or	317.3096244828754
granite; they know me by heart, and are steeled against all my weapons.	413.2951551660925
It is, however, impossible that this should end as they have decreed!”	302.95701386318694
In fact, as this last reflection indicated—this instinctive return to	333.44683083105946
hope—sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent	384.05859846605216
spirit. Milady sat down to table, ate from several dishes, drank a	323.9983216032885
little Spanish wine, and felt all her resolution return.	398.38325698725254
Before she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides,	421.64897815906994
examined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs,	348.6259076830103
and even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound,	374.76713594068235
skillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything	349.130318199436
considered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors.	374.7950396627732
One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: “If I	308.0492943855093
had listened to you,” Lord de Winter had said to Felton.	369.51102950575864
Felton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not	400.42267191557426
been willing to listen to him.	439.0338685780539
“Weak or strong,” repeated Milady, “that man has, then, a spark of pity	332.49661910889085
in his soul; of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him.	364.4694266214825
As to the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to	347.1713427721161
expect of me if ever I escape from his hands. It is useless, then, to	381.0289430356492
attempt anything with him. But Felton—that’s another thing. He is a	477.1037947074176
young, ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of	441.9296865291871
destroying.”	385.520393252017
And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.	310.103321097516
Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl	356.2863572877179
dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the	397.61359554230467
next festival.	388.36540768107346
Chapter LIII.	380.81376297883753
CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY	346.3386538720199
Milady dreamed that she at length had D’Artagnan in her power, that she	440.8820237011971
was present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood,	470.38053416112183
flowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming	318.8317508714392
smile upon her lips.	476.22865928091085
She slept as a prisoner sleeps, rocked by his first hope.	467.0286888194668
In the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed.	431.3589832060853
Felton remained in the corridor. He brought with him the woman of whom	425.9397783301288
he had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman	380.7262098595521
entered, and approaching Milady’s bed, offered her services.	388.39691555143656
Milady was habitually pale; her complexion might therefore deceive a	308.8722735063607
person who saw her for the first time.	460.6246705280578
“I am in a fever,” said she; “I have not slept a single instant during	458.7993251450623
all this long night. I suffer horribly. Are you likely to be more	341.00096531247334
humane to me than others were yesterday? All I ask is permission to	420.07711883927306
remain abed.”	350.3419365887288
“Would you like to have a physician called?” said the woman.	401.468411817163
Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word.	379.5257664326464
Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she	404.32751899193966
would have to work upon, and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch.	425.0537304199628
Besides, the physician might declare the ailment feigned; and Milady,	396.4652272178696
after having lost the first trick, was not willing to lose the second.	420.61574198922426
“Go and fetch a physician?” said she. “What could be the good of that?	366.5254381706431
These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy; it	449.99458032152006
would be just the same today, no doubt—for since yesterday evening they	487.7344267620383
have had plenty of time to send for a doctor.”	341.1464654338595
“Then,” said Felton, who became impatient, “say yourself, madame, what	330.2547507624144
treatment you wish followed.”	456.08000361121674
“Eh, how can I tell? My God! I know that I suffer, that’s all. Give me	439.76039437341956
anything you like, it is of little consequence.”	405.48409861502716
“Go and fetch Lord de Winter,” said Felton, tired of these eternal	380.0550648613141
complaints.	320.313970990474
“Oh, no, no!” cried Milady; “no, sir, do not call him, I conjure you. I	302.656393996793
am well, I want nothing; do not call him.”	318.0231440909802
She gave so much vehemence, such magnetic eloquence to this	475.9937419637524
exclamation, that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into	359.0445512625793
the room.	460.01697368504915
“He has come!” thought Milady.	310.9951066399397
“Meanwhile, madame, if you really suffer,” said Felton, “a physician	433.9386421125873
shall be sent for; and if you deceive us—well, it will be the worse for	360.65793921714976
you. But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with	388.25523534916636
anything.”	318.4204697254075
Milady made no reply, but turning her beautiful head round upon her	295.98609385037525
pillow, she burst into tears, and uttered heartbreaking sobs.	296.7592706222504
Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness; then,	468.67238444104674
seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged, he went out. The	351.53903846473224
woman followed him, and Lord de Winter did not appear.	318.833982207723
“I fancy I begin to see my way,” murmured Milady, with a savage joy,	361.4992458487959
burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be	319.9744929969437
watching her this burst of inward satisfaction.	313.13850461283073
Two hours passed away.	442.2686411652738
“Now it is time that the malady should be over,” said she; “let me	318.63409240698934
rise, and obtain some success this very day. I have but ten days, and	489.03609761199016
this evening two of them will be gone.”	432.35655492971136
In the morning, when they entered Milady’s chamber they had brought her	323.9283933292349
breakfast. Now, she thought, they could not long delay coming to clear	317.4215981381919
the table, and that Felton would then reappear.	419.1963902579819
Milady was not deceived. Felton reappeared, and without observing	398.3172141232793
whether Milady had or had not touched her repast, made a sign that the	375.5506915080604
table should be carried out of the room, it having been brought in	396.25672002008156
ready spread.	477.6228547762445
Felton remained behind; he held a book in his hand.	437.745417849742
Milady, reclining in an armchair near the chimney, beautiful, pale, and	311.94299708832636
resigned, looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom.	320.8934758729611
Felton approached her, and said, “Lord de Winter, who is a Catholic,	427.012577625809
like yourself, madame, thinking that the deprivation of the rites and	459.9421687596459
ceremonies of your church might be painful to you, has consented that	481.7928742221918
you should read every day the ordinary of your Mass; and here is a book	400.21815273901814
which contains the ritual.”	403.4758040729423
At the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near	420.0922352187053
which Milady was sitting, at the tone in which he pronounced the two	324.7419901060198
words, _your Mass_, at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied	428.8030536599448
them, Milady raised her head, and looked more attentively at the	432.9616527796059
officer.	348.7155768263579
By that plain arrangement of the hair, by that costume of extreme	305.0986466689833
simplicity, by the brow polished like marble and as hard and	385.3915553940443
impenetrable, she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so	422.77048553388204
often met, not only in the court of King James, but in that of the King	298.8035554090245
of France, where, in spite of the remembrance of the St. Bartholomew,	300.165592781287
they sometimes came to seek refuge.	450.4131170236619
She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of	484.7221756275668
genius receive in great crises, in supreme moments which are to decide	445.6668924246246
their fortunes or their lives.	294.82219632063635
Those two words, _your Mass_, and a simple glance cast upon Felton,	309.6801349099125
revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make;	351.5630320642628
but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her, this	332.0105944345853
reply, ready arranged, presented itself to her lips:	352.91255513729845
“I?” said she, with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she	394.92981156679224
had remarked in the voice of the young officer, “I, sir? _My Mass?_	462.79910626736176
Lord de Winter, the corrupted Catholic, knows very well that I am not	399.68560755013647
of his religion, and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me!”	382.06962193957145
“And of what religion are you, then, madame?” asked Felton, with an	470.76932830024873
astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could	331.88334314770566
not entirely conceal.	402.0269025492168
“I will tell it,” cried Milady, with a feigned exultation, “on the day	488.0934687116678
when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith.”	310.24050544199787
The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she	312.9286630152269
had opened for herself by this single word.	368.5948748253006
The young officer, however, remained mute and motionless; his look	489.9679814292979
alone had spoken.	325.9092769349268
“I am in the hands of my enemies,” continued she, with that tone of	299.91090357675495
enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans. “Well, let my	415.81039356230104
God save me, or let me perish for my God! That is the reply I beg you	319.4177871118999
to make to Lord de Winter. And as to this book,” added she, pointing to	448.7965576831507
the manual with her finger but without touching it, as if she must be	438.29036045540204
contaminated by it, “you may carry it back and make use of it yourself,	390.03562145795615
for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winter—the	373.78264834842116
accomplice in his persecutions, the accomplice in his heresies.”	347.46395529334427
Felton made no reply, took the book with the same appearance of	381.64595309374585
repugnance which he had before manifested, and retired pensively.	371.5593876350007
Lord de Winter came toward five o’clock in the evening. Milady had had	446.15190226183125
time, during the whole day, to trace her plan of conduct. She received	302.4614952755092
him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages.	417.9711777079705
“It appears,” said the baron, seating himself in the armchair opposite	464.3396597445824
that occupied by Milady, and stretching out his legs carelessly upon	369.2145896385804
the hearth, “it appears we have made a little apostasy!”	491.24765684768107
“What do you mean, sir!”	358.4977218872444
“I mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion.	427.5090177817606
You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband, have	362.7837080837992
you?”	357.4929814695119
“Explain yourself, my Lord,” replied the prisoner, with majesty; “for	352.3982926336514
though I hear your words, I declare I do not understand them.”	467.97086696832696
“Then you have no religion at all; I like that best,” replied Lord de	418.47038594342723
Winter, laughing.	365.92350998809195
“Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles,” replied	379.5997333066803
Milady, frigidly.	294.50435156404484
“Oh, I confess it is all the same to me.”	334.22278356472304
“Oh, you need not avow this religious indifference, my Lord; your	394.1879882882927
debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it.”	293.586875966074
“What, you talk of debaucheries, Madame Messalina, Lady Macbeth! Either	339.3616902936759
I misunderstand you or you are very shameless!”	440.34336663684985
“You only speak thus because you are overheard,” coolly replied Milady;	331.1737044519012
“and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me.”	446.68245645924776
“My jailers and my hangmen! Heyday, madame! you are taking a poetical	301.5782233107461
tone, and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening. As	312.2654739065149
to the rest, in eight days you will be where you ought to be, and my	378.2780352720308
task will be completed.”	322.62464287517895
“Infamous task! impious task!” cried Milady, with the exultation of a	380.04151343831904
victim who provokes his judge.	304.2672874041632
“My word,” said de Winter, rising, “I think the hussy is going mad!	365.3268791691842
Come, come, calm yourself, Madame Puritan, or I’ll remove you to a	359.59917256826225
dungeon. It’s my Spanish wine that has got into your head, is it not?	489.9123817479278
But never mind; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous, and will	473.9524040292107
have no bad effects.”	463.0607064664147
And Lord de Winter retired swearing, which at that period was a very	437.92333482651736
knightly habit.	408.44247230365477
Felton was indeed behind the door, and had not lost one word of this	432.70016016330254
scene. Milady had guessed aright.	407.2000924659196
“Yes, go, go!” said she to her brother; “the effects _are_ drawing	423.0170221051126
near, on the contrary; but you, weak fool, will not see them until it	351.62421743760643
is too late to shun them.”	376.53462510708727
Silence was re-established. Two hours passed away. Milady’s supper was	448.72925893703996
brought in, and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers	419.54911706493016
aloud—prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second	327.1188451835208
husband, a most austere Puritan. She appeared to be in ecstasy, and did	365.4909668036192
not pay the least attention to what was going on around her. Felton	386.5132816223393
made a sign that she should not be disturbed; and when all was	467.80588360476327
arranged, he went out quietly with the soldiers.	372.9498845872575
Milady knew she might be watched, so she continued her prayers to the	348.27771850446237
end; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her	357.0749104493644
door did not march with the same step, and seemed to listen. For the	394.41838747641424
moment she wished nothing better. She arose, came to the table, ate but	476.40538824902126
little, and drank only water.	370.2820816626529
An hour after, her table was cleared; but Milady remarked that this	360.2900615112471
time Felton did not accompany the soldiers. He feared, then, to see her	440.77722474332046
too often.	335.6104138284102
She turned toward the wall to smile—for there was in this smile such an	461.79247315795647
expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her.	335.26019382846744
She allowed, therefore, half an hour to pass away; and as at that	305.9663854492925
moment all was silence in the old castle, as nothing was heard but the	430.1991120073778
eternal murmur of the waves—that immense breaking of the ocean—with her	392.586593309273
pure, harmonious, and powerful voice, she began the first couplet of	330.9829380801805
the psalm then in great favor with the Puritans:	487.4528921291346
“Thou leavest thy servants, Lord,	425.64386383707176
    To see if they be strong;	345.5083433631383
But soon thou dost afford	355.1360360919763
    Thy hand to lead them on.”	417.0039124633695
These verses were not excellent—very far from it; but as it is well	357.3021113744536
known, the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry.	305.644304547606
While singing, Milady listened. The soldier on guard at her door	490.6010716435258
stopped, as if he had been changed into stone. Milady was then able to	340.17848530252894
judge of the effect she had produced.	385.34616731908795
Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling.	489.812824220931
It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the	307.860708234127
vaulted roofs, and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts	472.6653458634297
of her jailers. It however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty—a	364.65940103209726
zealous Catholic, no doubt—shook off the charm, for through the door he	407.95462914621487
called: “Hold your tongue, madame! Your song is as dismal as a ‘De	344.0836261137823
profundis’; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here, we	432.1988801399641
must hear such things as these, no mortal can hold out.”	489.4733073623472
“Silence!” then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized	375.1706875855858
as that of Felton. “What are you meddling with, stupid? Did anybody	328.0629274856104
order you to prevent that woman from singing? No. You were told to	470.129510304683
guard her—to fire at her if she attempted to fly. Guard her! If she	404.179463315291
flies, kill her; but don’t exceed your orders.”	329.3954264179631
An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady;	378.2955037522648
but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning.	461.50474289341435
Without appearing to have heard the dialogue, of which she had not lost	320.5685064963962
a word, she began again, giving to her voice all the charm, all the	465.84697114215686
power, all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it:	355.7673707927523
“For all my tears, my cares,	441.3167419198353
    My exile, and my chains,	326.0802894594834
I have my youth, my prayers,	304.859037776869
    And God, who counts my pains.”	478.69788726231627
Her voice, of immense power and sublime expression, gave to the rude,	311.42797778288576
unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most	366.2668390540455
exalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren, and which	467.1337311432908
they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their	299.70387733170804
imagination. Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who	372.7309275935529
consoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.	484.73184018589234
Milady continued:	488.2820406622423
“One day our doors will ope,	475.54380504530843
    With God come our desire;	407.82135150964575
And if betrays that hope,	476.51418829916605
    To death we can aspire.”	483.4406557082617
This verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul,	326.03972664262045
completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.	336.3297644708406
He opened the door quickly; and Milady saw him appear, pale as usual,	463.53772298028997
but with his eye inflamed and almost wild.	418.2381520950437
“Why do you sing thus, and with such a voice?” said he.	454.481221061837
“Your pardon, sir,” said Milady, with mildness. “I forgot that my songs	483.979309605837
are out of place in this castle. I have perhaps offended you in your	357.82478033891425
creed; but it was without wishing to do so, I swear. Pardon me, then, a	488.1779267346104
fault which is perhaps great, but which certainly was involuntary.”	457.4853519933869
Milady was so beautiful at this moment, the religious ecstasy in which	454.2676273346872
she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance,	343.3548766087364
that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he	402.1595918408742
had only just before heard.	359.5804203634315
“Yes, yes,” said he; “you disturb, you agitate the people who live in	479.97133909605367
the castle.”	335.6558491097112
The poor, senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his	321.3136436093708
words, while Milady was reading with her lynx’s eyes the very depths of	333.1477299461597
his heart.	385.30074994499194
“I will be silent, then,” said Milady, casting down her eyes with all	469.2571429100474
the sweetness she could give to her voice, with all the resignation she	409.81543810485755
could impress upon her manner.	340.1643849152709
“No, no, madame,” said Felton, “only do not sing so loud, particularly	297.1052564262046
at night.”	370.50804873413443
And at these words Felton, feeling that he could not long maintain his	409.0285755229131
severity toward his prisoner, rushed out of the room.	307.9469459578357
“You have done right, Lieutenant,” said the soldier. “Such songs	366.09737879434806
disturb the mind; and yet we become accustomed to them, her voice is so	387.2041734751317
beautiful.”	376.81554921326915
Chapter LIV.	447.5849872142777
CAPTIVITY: THE THIRD DAY	473.28235223789096
Felton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken. He	405.8801006067748
must be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but	474.98456872786426
obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.	377.1197875697384
Still more must be done. He must be made to speak, in order that he	335.8204315795634
might be spoken to—for Milady very well knew that her greatest	425.859204320808
seduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole	427.50963451252
gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial.	374.0119235445278
Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might fail—for Felton was	305.0827943405344
forewarned, and that against the least chance. From that moment she	473.92933467326867
watched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his	320.3920551686434
eyes to his gestures—even to a breath that could be interpreted as a	404.24028391998695
sigh. In short, she studied everything, as a skillful comedian does to	475.9080602424341
whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not	430.4759367614735
accustomed.	391.90844214509787
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy. She	416.310534365582
had laid that down the preceding evening. To remain silent and	332.54051514711836
dignified in his presence; from time to time to irritate him by	334.87974564649517
affected disdain, by a contemptuous word; to provoke him to threats and	374.40561118162987
violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation—such	399.4775702869365
was her plan. Felton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but	308.6444174217423
he would see.	489.6184543712479
In the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside	296.1699939121378
over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to	450.2384717824805
him. At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a	394.09865510472923
ray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved	454.4799813598846
without any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to	378.4524395209551
control himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about to	316.7615044406489
escape from his lips, and went out. Toward midday, Lord de Winter	359.40034241329477
entered.	360.11565585031076
It was a tolerably fine winter’s day, and a ray of that pale English	335.1577737634755
sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.	321.73938214968575
Milady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the	340.7927292267484
door as it opened.	352.21928576431594
“Ah, ah!” said Lord de Winter, “after having played comedy, after	463.5797886584678
having played tragedy, we are now playing melancholy?”	355.13996411575675
The prisoner made no reply.	462.1033430102436
“Yes, yes,” continued Lord de Winter, “I understand. You would like	337.60670365873113
very well to be at liberty on that beach! You would like very well to	447.5441225946464
be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald-green sea; you	368.4781255705661
would like very well, either on land or on the ocean, to lay for me one	309.5135031406705
of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning.	331.51981706162
Patience, patience! In four days’ time the shore will be beneath your	410.0279798124805
feet, the sea will be open to you—more open than will perhaps be	466.3129746042575
agreeable to you, for in four days England will be relieved of you.”	373.2077580356459
Milady folded her hands, and raising her fine eyes toward heaven,	439.8512341909599
“Lord, Lord,” said she, with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone,	490.67074416904507
“pardon this man, as I myself pardon him.”	433.8417837196766
“Yes, pray, accursed woman!” cried the baron; “your prayer is so much	458.72652877397945
the more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a	430.003594024506
man who will never pardon you!” and he went out.	307.45127981703916
At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening	463.23355292377437
of the nearly closed door, and she perceived Felton, who drew quickly	489.65679329638374
to one side to prevent being seen by her.	311.24570378347437
Then she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.	431.3490762388336
“My God, my God!” said she, “thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer;	458.2626557744204
give me, then, strength to suffer.”	361.47851138389007
The door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear	391.33329123623605
the noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:	315.6688464616662
“God of vengeance! God of goodness! wilt thou allow the frightful	453.72670274549614
projects of this man to be accomplished?”	346.9610149532251
Then only she pretended to hear the sound of Felton’s steps, and rising	374.02075535288947
quick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her	490.8822871097105
knees.	459.60577182526447
“I do not like to disturb those who pray, madame,” said Felton,	347.70106034398583
seriously; “do not disturb yourself on my account, I beseech you.”	369.24773568008504
“How do you know I was praying, sir?” said Milady, in a voice broken by	469.04388425232264
sobs. “You were deceived, sir; I was not praying.”	475.47930506737464
“Do you think, then, madame,” replied Felton, in the same serious	408.624852366445
voice, but with a milder tone, “do you think I assume the right of	322.56454211804885
preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator? God	445.3845405604418
forbid! Besides, repentance becomes the guilty; whatever crimes they	354.209924101794
may have committed, for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God!”	292.1021227063907
“Guilty? I?” said Milady, with a smile which might have disarmed the	414.35705535946295
angel of the last judgment. “Guilty? Oh, my God, thou knowest whether I	423.9499064930012
am guilty! Say I am condemned, sir, if you please; but you know that	370.51017970077476
God, who loves martyrs, sometimes permits the innocent to be	487.4424068600829
condemned.”	354.2708038824819
“Were you condemned, were you innocent, were you a martyr,” replied	387.82100107447087
Felton, “the greater would be the necessity for prayer; and I myself	297.96692312962773
would aid you with my prayers.”	418.68970476532604
“Oh, you are a just man!” cried Milady, throwing herself at his feet.	490.1920946760459
“I can hold out no longer, for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at	451.99634594688416
the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle, and confess	347.294334002838
my faith. Listen, then, to the supplication of a despairing woman. You	294.5671528599462
are abused, sir; but that is not the question. I only ask you one	385.8217079712634
favor; and if you grant it me, I will bless you in this world and in	489.98350782897035
the next.”	342.35626143709334
“Speak to the master, madame,” said Felton; “happily I am neither	374.7720421125781
charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing. It is upon one	405.53503883338544
higher placed than I am that God has laid this responsibility.”	348.35547951243296
“To you—no, to you alone! Listen to me, rather than add to my	489.95838602199456
destruction, rather than add to my ignominy!”	327.7805550745878
“If you have merited this shame, madame, if you have incurred this	361.2129642459347
ignominy, you must submit to it as an offering to God.”	428.3305720770341
“What do you say? Oh, you do not understand me! When I speak of	416.84444795865375
ignominy, you think I speak of some chastisement, of imprisonment or	335.872112540611
death. Would to heaven! Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or	328.92390670563555
death?”	420.4716545039672
“It is I who no longer understand you, madame,” said Felton.	405.42641035393007
“Or, rather, who pretend not to understand me, sir!” replied the	357.9326674487897
prisoner, with a smile of incredulity.	311.32620121501384
“No, madame, on the honor of a soldier, on the faith of a Christian.”	397.63072291782726
“What, you are ignorant of Lord de Winter’s designs upon me?”	382.96034252467985
“I am.”	352.1800425810338
“Impossible; you are his confidant!”	420.27999394979855
“I never lie, madame.”	340.13882802881204
“Oh, he conceals them too little for you not to divine them.”	470.80583911329916
“I seek to divine nothing, madame; I wait till I am confided in, and	326.4981576372388
apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you, he has	414.3778061343399
confided nothing to me.”	489.34424255116346
“Why, then,” cried Milady, with an incredible tone of truthfulness,	329.7444449934911
“you are not his accomplice; you do not know that he destines me to a	362.82083115341493
disgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in	346.00899400887175
horror?”	310.94590449380127
“You are deceived, madame,” said Felton, blushing; “Lord de Winter is	382.17093490633164
not capable of such a crime.”	425.6151179285396
“Good,” said Milady to herself; “without thinking what it is, he calls	374.39713635072076
it a crime!” Then aloud, “The friend of that wretch is capable of	387.82232085142016
everything.”	438.07941668631497
“Whom do you call _that wretch?_” asked Felton.	387.8278275998763
“Are there, then, in England two men to whom such an epithet can be	327.7562117453071
applied?”	441.4801181485082
“You mean George Villiers?” asked Felton, whose looks became excited.	349.7536528485708
“Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham,” replied	466.1358651832126
Milady. “I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all	455.88109768843924
England who would have required so long an explanation to make him	424.0378395162067
understand of whom I was speaking.”	364.04796334657146
“The hand of the Lord is stretched over him,” said Felton; “he will not	300.3981923012643
escape the chastisement he deserves.”	294.677302670228
Felton only expressed, with regard to the duke, the feeling of	476.5226240136376
execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the	437.1558207895689
Catholics themselves called the extortioner, the pillager, the	306.3938576458723
debauchee, and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan.	315.2430104882351
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Milady; “when I supplicate thee to pour	449.13052312103423
upon this man the chastisement which is his due, thou knowest it is not	307.093704531026
my own vengeance I pursue, but the deliverance of a whole nation that I	474.4963281179974
implore!”	300.98370377786887
“Do you know him, then?” asked Felton.	439.38336181539233
“At length he interrogates me!” said Milady to herself, at the height	438.7077521100909
of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result. “Oh, know	434.39904683811875
him? Yes, yes! to my misfortune, to my eternal misfortune!” and Milady	420.204343864616
twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief.	449.3550809289057
Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning	353.7880959385572
him, and he made several steps toward the door; but the prisoner, whose	410.32829671757645
eye never left him, sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him.	304.27392700079923
“Sir,” cried she, “be kind, be clement, listen to my prayer! That	389.4396562168421
knife, which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of, because he	381.37687811306023
knows the use I would make of it! Oh, hear me to the end! that knife,	463.05296101590955
give it to me for a minute only, for mercy’s, for pity’s sake! I will	453.21348297465664
embrace your knees! You shall shut the door that you may be certain I	335.0847153217891
contemplate no injury to you! My God! to you—the only just, good, and	411.2253874074255
compassionate being I have met with! To you—my preserver, perhaps! One	316.529586233746
minute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it	326.1908824397209
to you through the grating of the door. Only one minute, Mr. Felton,	409.8560387232192
and you will have saved my honor!”	293.17192617546334
“To kill yourself?” cried Felton, with terror, forgetting to withdraw	304.5159856318635
his hands from the hands of the prisoner, “to kill yourself?”	342.0919898686001
“I have told, sir,” murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing	419.8466559805588
herself to sink overpowered to the ground; “I have told my secret! He	340.922177112206
knows all! My God, I am lost!”	328.7751907246062
Felton remained standing, motionless and undecided.	380.7005924295893
“He still doubts,” thought Milady; “I have not been earnest enough.”	471.8136246865133
Someone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord	491.4747431374982
de Winter.	458.0056449198013
Felton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door.	385.93571352484116
Milady sprang toward him. “Oh, not a word,” said she in a concentrated	388.48954969236496
voice, “not a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am	333.40048105521544
lost, and it would be you—you—”	464.62449201494917
Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard,	416.82917224222825
applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to	379.6785401097966
Felton’s mouth.	424.0145677739926
Felton gently repulsed Milady, and she sank into a chair.	488.8809263872037
Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard	378.42260351346744
the noise of his footsteps soon die away.	356.49249879289357
Felton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and	459.5242425220323
listening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a	371.7584131369107
man awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment.	385.55999144648933
“Ah!” said Milady, listening in her turn to the noise of Felton’s	470.8003587973525
steps, which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de	434.4641613631459
Winter; “at length you are mine!”	375.39952559649953
Then her brow darkened. “If he tells the baron,” said she, “I am	384.2430596355034
lost—for the baron, who knows very well that I shall not kill myself,	378.7853189807348
will place me before him with a knife in my hand, and he will discover	363.9684835448983
that all this despair is but acted.”	466.60452117178284
She placed herself before the glass, and regarded herself attentively;	296.0960422205671
never had she appeared more beautiful.	327.1928649758987
“Oh, yes,” said she, smiling, “but we won’t tell him!”	349.02080376667163
In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper.	353.479654372528
“Sir,” said Milady, “is your presence an indispensable accessory of my	350.7160869648055
captivity? Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your	446.0239604716197
visits cause me?”	490.81902643016724
“How, dear sister!” said Lord de Winter. “Did not you sentimentally	320.40224514039716
inform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that	301.5374483121613
you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease,	425.69156969227754
an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation	294.4262120492144
that you had risked everything for it—seasickness, tempest, captivity?	395.8020667326003
Well, here I am; be satisfied. Besides, this time, my visit has a	292.57957531001364
motive.”	295.2121438418344
Milady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her	421.8122910530243
life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful	444.99222992345864
emotions, felt her heart beat so violently.	379.7929495820443
She was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and	435.52573641159756
sat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he	365.46605207312666
unfolded it slowly.	488.47127808853486
“Here,” said he, “I want to show you the kind of passport which I have	448.9462497480828
drawn up, and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in	428.3912788618817
the life I consent to leave you.”	437.45061722149904
Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: “‘Order to	484.6747792352038
conduct—’ The name is blank,” interrupted Lord de Winter. “If you have	480.1471978059501
any preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a	376.06087567330843
thousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes. I	385.5167641702351
will begin again, then:	401.01723726083526
“‘Order to conduct to—the person named Charlotte Backson, branded by	427.5069775890368
the justice of the kingdom of France, but liberated after chastisement.	360.41542830107693
She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three	478.6202792131688
leagues from it. In case of any attempt to escape, the penalty of death	424.73142812545467
is to be applied. She will receive five shillings per day for lodging	367.7194355248579
and food’”.	379.88002329924836
“That order does not concern me,” replied Milady, coldly, “since it	381.20129188973436
bears another name than mine.”	408.1079805363151
“A name? Have you a name, then?”	368.669009650856
“I bear that of your brother.”	409.1528915199111
“Ay, but you are mistaken. My brother is only your second husband; and	437.8184193689959
your first is still living. Tell me his name, and I will put it in the	370.20223275388093
place of the name of Charlotte Backson. No? You will not? You are	367.85965080307955
silent? Well, then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson.”	462.3955334163543
Milady remained silent; only this time it was no longer from	465.76469864508795
affectation, but from terror. She believed the order ready for	486.0008820037491
execution. She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure;	335.7316704666076
she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening. Everything	403.2940945638999
in her mind was lost for an instant; when all at once she perceived	447.76813460881505
that no signature was attached to the order. The joy she felt at this	491.89713549460134
discovery was so great she could not conceal it.	476.39072799817114
“Yes, yes,” said Lord de Winter, who perceived what was passing in her	484.4882861212376
mind; “yes, you look for the signature, and you say to yourself: ‘All	408.0845097481016
is not lost, for that order is not signed. It is only shown to me to	326.86317997573167
terrify me, that’s all.’ You are mistaken. Tomorrow this order will be	329.4567306240491
sent to the Duke of Buckingham. The day after tomorrow it will return	461.8944765330267
signed by his hand and marked with his seal; and four-and-twenty hours	429.1494879060994
afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution. Adieu,	325.70060173267296
madame. That is all I had to say to you.”	368.1442210884953
“And I reply to you, sir, that this abuse of power, this exile under a	397.3686180149648
fictitious name, are infamous!”	402.09560583137886
“Would you like better to be hanged in your true name, Milady? You know	421.3470200001219
that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage. Speak	463.812802135258
freely. Although my name, or rather that of my brother, would be mixed	443.55437931008277
up with the affair, I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make	400.6547423615381
myself certain of getting rid of you.”	422.0330660422027
Milady made no reply, but became as pale as a corpse.	322.8023655034612
“Oh, I see you prefer peregrination. That’s well madame; and there is	491.7610321863941
an old proverb that says, ‘Traveling trains youth.’ My faith! you are	434.5615652961228
not wrong after all, and life is sweet. That’s the reason why I take	368.1604418021549
such care you shall not deprive me of mine. There only remains, then,	305.7583269529928
the question of the five shillings to be settled. You think me rather	368.0104580073122
parsimonious, don’t you? That’s because I don’t care to leave you the	473.9942903689716
means of corrupting your jailers. Besides, you will always have your	310.21290256790206
charms left to seduce them with. Employ them, if your check with regard	435.69034869039865
to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind.”	370.0370229660838
“Felton has not told him,” said Milady to herself. “Nothing is lost,	301.2067244674102
then.”	402.11523575113404
“And now, madame, till I see you again! Tomorrow I will come and	401.3825584723747
announce to you the departure of my messenger.”	395.9065666710036
Lord de Winter rose, saluted her ironically, and went out.	348.77754005365694
Milady breathed again. She had still four days before her. Four days	311.24047582631124
would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton.	313.85737848317984
A terrible idea, however, rushed into her mind. She thought that Lord	323.05344962055403
de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by	463.99972125766897
the Duke of Buckingham. In that case Felton would escape her—for in	334.80918178467687
order to secure success, the magic of a continuous seduction was	368.31591251438476
necessary. Nevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured	455.7462506565189
her. Felton had not spoken.	418.2101401684504
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de	406.5805716383928
Winter, she placed herself at the table and ate.	319.75708955101163
Then, as she had done the evening before, she fell on her knees and	390.47681378432
repeated her prayers aloud. As on the evening before, the soldier	391.5147679046498
stopped his march to listen to her.	358.6917760278299
Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel, which	330.6979288063567
came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door.	311.9975542494936
“It is he,” said she. And she began the same religious chant which had	491.665065072634
so strongly excited Felton the evening before.	471.05049273047155
But although her voice—sweet, full, and sonorous—vibrated as	397.78312341514345
harmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut. It	390.4335690806961
appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she	433.02990821610365
darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw	357.8073724647583
the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But	470.2116680077417
whether this was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient	474.60882743844365
self-command not to enter.	356.8106905201122
However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song,	375.57132479360314
Milady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had	298.6750859841826
heard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret.	486.5342362103493
Chapter LV.	429.2630718702861
CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY	371.9341360875375
The next day, when Felton entered Milady’s apartment he found her	485.7511604634789
standing, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by	294.8309588780056
means of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope one	308.8725000955456
with another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in	390.91794719606736
entering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal	483.57330888716194
behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.	298.53757239121353
The young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want	383.0468955666836
of sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless,	339.99859624147916
his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.	309.1110669986008
He advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an	402.19438629910667
end of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she	455.4775603994307
allowed to be seen, “What is this, madame?” he asked coldly.	353.38999081526197
“That? Nothing,” said Milady, smiling with that painful expression	299.6428197805702
which she knew so well how to give to her smile. “Ennui is the mortal	318.76443053053845
enemy of prisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that	337.11315001298993
rope.”	336.8788683844986
Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment	296.55809383815784
before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she	364.3863110058943
was now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw,	461.0276034284045
fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.	400.84942684510037
He started, and the prisoner saw that start—for though her eyes were	394.03260303491214
cast down, nothing escaped her.	471.2194998297014
“What were you doing on that armchair?” asked he.	332.331233526425
“Of what consequence?” replied Milady.	436.3311116210299
“But,” replied Felton, “I wish to know.”	402.6217417031521
“Do not question me,” said the prisoner; “you know that we who are true	446.9307294119424
Christians are forbidden to lie.”	344.98777439404034
“Well, then,” said Felton, “I will tell you what you were doing, or	462.6764626919926
rather what you meant to do; you were going to complete the fatal	318.95963483315086
project you cherish in your mind. Remember, madame, if our God forbids	387.332186988262
falsehood, he much more severely condemns suicide.”	482.4589400257306
“When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly, placed between	468.04917092376
suicide and dishonor, believe me, sir,” replied Milady, in a tone of	402.4783124368217
deep conviction, “God pardons suicide, for then suicide becomes	294.85831613632115
martyrdom.”	405.41060480033946
“You say either too much or too little; speak, madame. In the name of	383.6167504742119
heaven, explain yourself.”	464.39124919591103
“That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables; that	427.16389123394026
I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my	385.946272655507
persecutor? No, sir. Besides, of what importance to you is the life or	478.11816929118316
death of a condemned wretch? You are only responsible for my body, is	310.4988875373389
it not so? And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as	346.7656610412416
mine, they will require no more of you; nay, perhaps you will even have	336.51892038532753
a double reward.”	458.60400412426765
“I, madame, I?” cried Felton. “You suppose that I would ever accept the	327.22728993856805
price of your life? Oh, you cannot believe what you say!”	381.4618329151108
“Let me act as I please, Felton, let me act as I please,” said Milady,	352.6240962595508
elated. “Every soldier must be ambitious, must he not? You are a	387.5731233076448
lieutenant? Well, you will follow me to the grave with the rank of	327.63577784817096
captain.”	482.0871596140164
“What have I, then, done to you,” said Felton, much agitated, “that you	394.4573747758602
should load me with such a responsibility before God and before men? In	300.57140682586237
a few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will	480.2083331366497
then no longer be under my care, and,” added he, with a sigh, “then you	297.3318356940727
can do what you will with it.”	425.6864291619531
“So,” cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a	312.7785276927551
holy indignation, “you, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you	449.60826229522934
ask but one thing—and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed,	295.43232737368515
by my death!”	376.2620715385631
“It is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.”	448.90586022810885
“But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling? Cruel enough, if	471.2853041082269
I am guilty; but what name can you give it, what name will the Lord	446.34651207140394
give it, if I am innocent?”	370.20439394766976
“I am a soldier, madame, and fulfill the orders I have received.”	408.68608650269306
“Do you believe, then, that at the day of the Last Judgment God will	312.7527284683755
separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges? You are not willing	373.52087211092703
that I should kill my body, and you make yourself the agent of him who	462.60451857981843
would kill my soul.”	381.0061587982562
“But I repeat it again to you,” replied Felton, in great emotion, “no	388.1003766187547
danger threatens you; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself.”	396.9806405212213
“Dunce,” cried Milady, “dunce! who dares to answer for another man,	306.8768281845715
when the wisest, when those most after God’s own heart, hesitate to	306.5423467359367
answer for themselves, and who ranges himself on the side of the	409.3398313179147
strongest and the most fortunate, to crush the weakest and the most	483.2312058199964
unfortunate.”	430.56100614459945
“Impossible, madame, impossible,” murmured Felton, who felt to the	353.0554845996984
bottom of his heart the justness of this argument. “A prisoner, you	441.8173467830492
will not recover your liberty through me; living, you will not lose	446.86691554092215
your life through me.”	377.91243898448033
“Yes,” cried Milady, “but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me	452.47046757691476
than life, I shall lose my honor, Felton; and it is you, you whom I	483.55615060139235
make responsible, before God and before men, for my shame and my	419.84854358899156
infamy.”	489.6507764128658
This time Felton, immovable as he was, or appeared to be, could not	396.5325789087453
resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him.	308.85454333589973
To see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see	404.22168771272004
her by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the	381.70767243593724
ascendancy of grief and beauty—it was too much for a visionary; it was	483.0603529304023
too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic	436.6860705648563
faith; it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that	308.8871965989139
burns, by the hatred of men that devours.	361.3641023911855
Milady saw the trouble. She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing	433.03497201769176
passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic.	323.0323901144447
As a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches	413.2262253610272
toward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique	451.71126636152417
priestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her	441.61405089737264
throat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe	411.48972931461105
modestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which	451.1654561649622
had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan,	309.44883328604374
and went toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her	442.0504182655513
melodious voice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible	307.76971816034194
energy:	320.5806555998307
“Let this victim to Baal be sent,	490.6050386501345
    To the lions the martyr be thrown!	299.11202288422675
Thy God shall teach thee to repent!	389.01389424788346
    From th’ abyss he’ll give ear to my moan.”	343.4410517238568
Felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified.	315.9693696855915
“Who art thou? Who art thou?” cried he, clasping his hands. “Art thou a	348.2845508441532
messenger from God; art thou a minister from hell; art thou an angel or	388.9556428419768
a demon; callest thou thyself Eloa or Astarte?”	388.2793314668276
“Do you not know me, Felton? I am neither an angel nor a demon; I am a	444.2530552445663
daughter of earth, I am a sister of thy faith, that is all.”	318.72333494466824
“Yes, yes!” said Felton, “I doubted, but now I believe.”	361.43350986142707
“You believe, and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial	387.84418571809937
who is called Lord de Winter! You believe, and yet you leave me in the	451.26281684480256
hands of mine enemies, of the enemy of England, of the enemy of God!	437.7109643273432
You believe, and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the	324.8587603233575
world with his heresies and debaucheries—to that infamous Sardanapalus	382.3825232899517
whom the blind call the Duke of Buckingham, and whom believers name	362.09108641520334
Antichrist!”	314.1626247830018
“I deliver you up to Buckingham? I? what mean you by that?”	301.4541946385202
“They have eyes,” cried Milady, “but they see not; ears have they, but	342.0123205190378
they hear not.”	339.0635673904681
“Yes, yes!” said Felton, passing his hands over his brow, covered with	407.00907395695833
sweat, as if to remove his last doubt. “Yes, I recognize the voice	399.56554748738176
which speaks to me in my dreams; yes, I recognize the features of the	351.0484654260443
angel who appears to me every night, crying to my soul, which cannot	318.413434208625
sleep: ‘Strike, save England, save thyself—for thou wilt die without	294.98276577431113
having appeased God!’ Speak, speak!” cried Felton, “I can understand	396.16593387615916
you now.”	366.6426258311223
A flash of terrible joy, but rapid as thought, gleamed from the eyes of	356.4917859104288
Milady.	314.983085692127
However fugitive this homicide flash, Felton saw it, and started as if	415.03619918994343
its light had revealed the abysses of this woman’s heart. He recalled,	383.41049227631606
all at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady,	339.93441195835743
her first attempts after her arrival. He drew back a step, and hung	325.5238719561306
down his head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if,	344.63031675656373
fascinated by this strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from	488.24905211604477
her eyes.	321.260743597998
Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation.	381.076421180103
Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her.	373.2111894721161
Before Felton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this	338.9382820732843
conversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone,	324.5941699715209
she let her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered	408.5614170162776
the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: “But no, it is not	480.62416654135166
for me to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes. The	421.2681789492865
sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm. Allow me, then, to avoid	370.73846643333263
dishonor by death; let me take refuge in martyrdom. I do not ask you	298.2520787450901
for liberty, as a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a	457.0002569740951
pagan. Let me die; that is all. I supplicate you, I implore you on my	414.76401553311945
knees—let me die, and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my	371.63628522070843
preserver.”	484.22115051607716
Hearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid	372.86803856090216
and downcast, Felton reproached himself. By degrees the enchantress had	359.0947454529625
clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw	318.81323792609834
aside at will; that is to say, beauty, meekness, and tears—and above	349.0471485197562
all, the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness, the most	486.77697248298693
devouring of all voluptuousness.	444.57555169868743
“Alas!” said Felton, “I can do but one thing, which is to pity you if	305.81242251649553
you prove to me you are a victim! But Lord de Winter makes cruel	316.3469932337918
accusations against you. You are a Christian; you are my sister in	468.70117365374756
religion. I feel myself drawn toward you—I, who have never loved anyone	480.3928975019519
but my benefactor—I who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	438.23284850582706
men. But you, madame, so beautiful in reality, you, so pure in	320.68325012136165
appearance, must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to	489.94739976555996
pursue you thus.”	441.9723325897513
“They have eyes,” repeated Milady, with an accent of indescribable	356.8177532345601
grief, “but they see not; ears have they, but they hear not.”	412.94290163403787
“But,” cried the young officer, “speak, then, speak!”	354.73220574777537
“Confide my shame to you,” cried Milady, with the blush of modesty upon	423.9469154813477
her countenance, “for often the crime of one becomes the shame of	356.86291089470774
another—confide my shame to you, a man, and I a woman? Oh,” continued	466.9070538145701
she, placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes, “never!	413.34526416201606
never!—I could not!”	413.4245231602708
“To me, to a brother?” said Felton.	306.73043433168596
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young	449.0398533860233
man took for doubt, but which, however, was nothing but observation, or	347.10062328953575
rather the wish to fascinate.	313.1502426608871
Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.	392.53283466851656
“Well, then,” said Milady, “I confide in my brother; I will dare to—”	362.41722003303084
At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time	319.65750374011463
the terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on	312.0083806379929
the preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again.	379.2534948902003
He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened,	342.38726575586566
and he appeared.	313.1082555019811
During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and	461.10183507783347
when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.	312.12897116025465
The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to	326.7809611043554
the young officer.	305.2388361774408
“You have been here a very long time, John,” said he. “Has this woman	490.70338569550563
been relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the	382.7503566478265
length of the conversation.”	475.8888657829247
Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the	316.8492914607743
assistance of the disconcerted Puritan.	463.3939839711094
“Ah, you fear your prisoner should escape!” said she. “Well, ask your	448.577670908395
worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.”	450.49445348946324
“You demanded a favor?” said the baron, suspiciously.	436.9708100273409
“Yes, my Lord,” replied the young man, confused.	380.9621631585263
“And what favor, pray?” asked Lord de Winter.	299.276820386559
“A knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door	458.3475407521492
a minute after she had received it,” replied Felton.	373.63601707217674
“There is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady	376.9394544565961
is desirous of cutting,” said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous	330.97414932573054
tone.	467.173177405381
“There is myself,” replied Milady.	418.561064287611
“I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,” replied Lord	415.24180770120665
de Winter. “Choose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain	372.4152639609719
than the knife.”	444.5085855630523
Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the	449.3223640047293
moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand.	426.67497576381464
“You are right,” said she, “I have often thought of it.” Then she added	411.43000979061037
in a low voice, “And I will think of it again.”	454.17764713571364
Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de	342.1670188432829
Winter perceived this emotion.	294.8699537608477
“Mistrust yourself, John,” said he. “I have placed reliance upon you,	382.8404778966966
my friend. Beware! I have warned you! But be of good courage, my lad;	368.930216838099
in three days we shall be delivered from this creature, and where I	386.9508046188781
shall send her she can harm nobody.”	468.6370882059964
“You hear him!” cried Milady, with vehemence, so that the baron might	414.0860165399189
believe she was addressing heaven, and that Felton might understand she	431.111573837857
was addressing him.	479.00232387959227
Felton lowered his head and reflected.	323.4325953717158
The baron took the young officer by the arm, and turned his head over	323.94021749399445
his shoulder, so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out.	402.41105204297264
“Well,” said the prisoner, when the door was shut, “I am not so far	424.72022910976204
advanced as I believed. De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into	411.02447124408286
a strange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds	310.4117428421377
a man! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that cursed	483.23320645228574
D’Artagnan. A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them by	311.3084716402475
clasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by	483.57906219869386
clasping his arms round them.”	359.466458902549
Milady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would	297.65159133497895
pass away without her seeing Felton again. At last, in an hour after	304.97093051965476
the scene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low	464.6398659288364
voice at the door. Presently the door opened, and she perceived Felton.	476.0892817966974
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open	480.2877457936987
behind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much	293.10334465738833
agitated.	488.54345390082494
“What do you want with me?” said she.	327.8628635355257
“Listen,” replied Felton, in a low voice. “I have just sent away the	372.60693437425226
sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order	300.28435820388347
to speak to you without being overheard. The baron has just related a	302.9663883656255
frightful story to me.”	316.261938386143
Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim, and shook her head.	469.164718564669
“Either you are a demon,” continued Felton, “or the baron—my	390.85210352524774
benefactor, my father—is a monster. I have known you four days; I have	481.4691847262949
loved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not	382.6516068908088
alarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I	374.81176558885613
will come and see you, and you shall convince me.”	336.1643592262999
“No, Felton, no, my brother,” said she; “the sacrifice is too great,	424.94082243085944
and I feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with	339.1809758626947
me. My death will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence	378.13781241391393
of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the	418.5803432092772
prisoner.”	460.1076209329946
“Be silent, madame,” cried Felton, “and do not speak to me thus; I came	486.51446474610555
to entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what	429.95401259476455
you hold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.”	374.0766931850799
“I will not promise,” said Milady, “for no one has more respect for a	459.1415362893089
promise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep	292.0027951208125
it.”	408.06326874642843
“Well,” said Felton, “only promise till you have seen me again. If,	477.3504015459837
when you have seen me again, you still persist—well, then you shall be	299.58235749784143
free, and I myself will give you the weapon you desire.”	419.5162201315249
“Well,” said Milady, “for you I will wait.”	323.58744763843333
“Swear.”	447.250238198627
“I swear it, by our God. Are you satisfied?”	344.55426523945215
“Well,” said Felton, “till tonight.”	371.25418932530596
And he darted out of the room, shut the door, and waited in the	306.52282110825405
corridor, the soldier’s half-pike in his hand, and as if he had mounted	354.4537765334701
guard in his place.	352.51225188281285
The soldier returned, and Felton gave him back his weapon.	463.40452247440055
Then, through the grating to which she had drawn near, Milady saw the	378.3038264648162
young man make a sign with delirious fervor, and depart in an apparent	312.6002591082282
transport of joy.	487.94807086266326
As for her, she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt	300.8049060824579
upon her lips, and repeated, blaspheming, that terrible name of God, by	313.8808880505811
whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him.	422.4642309498829
“My God,” said she, “what a senseless fanatic! My God, it is I—I—and	406.1324767734652
this fellow who will help me to avenge myself.”	437.22178085973337
Chapter LVI.	394.2651227552426
CAPTIVITY: THE FIFTH DAY	436.3235392579696
Milady had however achieved a half-triumph, and success doubled her	417.08093147161793
forces.	348.6244677656176
It was not difficult to conquer, as she had hitherto done, men prompt	390.36471841406285
to let themselves be seduced, and whom the gallant education of a court	427.59824793757986
led quickly into her net. Milady was handsome enough not to find much	368.3684734842461
resistance on the part of the flesh, and she was sufficiently skillful	341.2271600687663
to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind.	431.768110641958
But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature,	396.15715996515746
concentrated and insensible by force of austerity. Religion and its	317.02768808193036
observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions.	368.4186386278757
There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast, projects so	366.3025004735357
tumultuous, that there remained no room for any capricious or material	392.6739876656436
love—that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption.	346.73504115333355
Milady had, then, made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a	438.09610219339106
man horribly prejudiced against her, and by her beauty in the heart of	467.13824857392694
a man hitherto chaste and pure. In short, she had taken the measure of	454.754601400791
motives hitherto unknown to herself, through this experiment, made upon	434.5341493103989
the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to	416.8093078264849
her study.	432.9242768706556
Many a time, nevertheless, during the evening she despaired of fate and	361.86171577661514
of herself. She did not invoke God, we very well know, but she had	475.3815650321169
faith in the genius of evil—that immense sovereignty which reigns in	461.0360582525423
all the details of human life, and by which, as in the Arabian fable, a	344.21809156880073
single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world.	355.00450503240717
Milady, being well prepared for the reception of Felton, was able to	320.92727049460996
erect her batteries for the next day. She knew she had only two days	345.22722014795613
left; that when once the order was signed by Buckingham—and Buckingham	430.76435195593456
would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name, and he	427.64783338674215
could not, therefore, recognize the woman in question—once this order	429.7110497528506
was signed, we say, the baron would make her embark immediately, and	472.9740113393342
she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less	348.75846719718805
powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose	422.2425097391483
beauty is lighted by the sun of the world, whose style the voice of	398.55494387112634
fashion lauds, and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting	399.6291492246831
splendors. To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful	454.33361233743585
punishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an obstacle to the	453.6096286749329
recovery of power. Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew what	459.8035552380011
suited her nature and her means. Poverty was repugnant to her;	459.848838177848
degradation took away two-thirds of her greatness. Milady was only a	448.6374488465344
queen while among queens. The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary	443.43442468247906
to her domination. To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation	485.83174118043416
than a pleasure for her.	462.51830383389694
She should certainly return from her exile—she did not doubt that a	354.4029932107025
single instant; but how long might this exile last? For an active,	473.7214130615679
ambitious nature, like that of Milady, days not spent in climbing are	397.0621405931058
inauspicious days. What word, then, can be found to describe the days	318.85129593006405
which they occupy in descending? To lose a year, two years, three	306.7120552394184
years, is to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace	341.3974281954784
of the cardinal, perhaps; to return when D’Artagnan and his friends,	343.3887922295976
happy and triumphant, should have received from the queen the reward	293.1483337429604
they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her—these were	405.8434992896131
devouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure. For the	353.49424621845503
rest, the storm which raged within her doubled her strength, and she	418.0755382060039
would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to	293.28180456946063
take for a single instant the proportions of her mind.	440.1870036504861
Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this	417.25039951031795
was the remembrance of the cardinal. What must the mistrustful,	340.9527328479365
restless, suspicious cardinal think of her silence—the cardinal, not	412.7068395033077
merely her only support, her only prop, her only protector at present,	296.38876584480255
but still further, the principal instrument of her future fortune and	360.8447194882017
vengeance? She knew him; she knew that at her return from a fruitless	321.4256741572714
journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment, in vain to	330.5185272903817
enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone. The cardinal would	398.9980762253609
reply, with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic, strong at once by	396.5953418731722
power and genius, “You should not have allowed yourself to be taken.”	300.39613656491747
Then Milady collected all her energies, murmuring in the depths of her	448.5486513511521
soul the name of Felton—the only beam of light that penetrated to her	359.33785403715774
in the hell into which she had fallen; and like a serpent which folds	312.21923758945803
and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength, she enveloped Felton	435.0172710474742
beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination.	372.9259603838219
Time, however, passed away; the hours, one after another, seemed to	294.8794344003789
awaken the clock as they passed, and every blow of the brass hammer	405.89530056515287
resounded upon the heart of the prisoner. At nine o’clock, Lord de	453.50119776257645
Winter made his customary visit, examined the window and the bars,	477.1041303886475
sounded the floor and the walls, looked to the chimney and the doors,	472.3385058522621
without, during this long and minute examination, he or Milady	322.97872798441495
pronouncing a single word.	409.2949591309906
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too	368.5172846728303
serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath.	346.89315920994727
“Well,” said the baron, on leaving her “you will not escape tonight!”	477.06383103178655
At ten o’clock Felton came and placed the sentinel. Milady recognized	305.8553994562425
his step. She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with	413.0646466613345
that of the lover of her heart; and yet Milady at the same time	479.7836632892737
detested and despised this weak fanatic.	458.50612264181143
That was not the appointed hour. Felton did not enter.	312.8421450325893
Two hours after, as midnight sounded, the sentinel was relieved. This	418.1173797578166
time it _was_ the hour, and from this moment Milady waited with	479.90803990652034
impatience. The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor. At the	382.7649271341123
expiration of ten minutes Felton came.	481.6403888808321
Milady was all attention.	292.8653901707651
“Listen,” said the young man to the sentinel. “On no pretense leave the	320.5433115841869
door, for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for	374.6659086697535
having quit his post for an instant, although I, during his absence,	311.4143924871055
watched in his place.”	426.7389881288979
“Yes, I know it,” said the soldier.	441.297272714059
“I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch. For my part I	383.9095134944203
am going to pay a second visit to this woman, who I fear entertains	324.7441410948566
sinister intentions upon her own life, and I have received orders to	340.0150418788459
watch her.”	426.5877803014977
“Good!” murmured Milady; “the austere Puritan lies.”	300.48958908644295
As to the soldier, he only smiled.	332.9905715453178
“Zounds, Lieutenant!” said he; “you are not unlucky in being charged	468.2758919039751
with such commissions, particularly if my Lord has authorized you to	386.4829184907711
look into her bed.”	317.2654781474796
Felton blushed. Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded	315.63127459763746
the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry, but his conscience	415.14543829324487
murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak.	408.8481961336555
“If I call, come,” said he. “If anyone comes, call me.”	417.01906433971834
“I will, Lieutenant,” said the soldier.	483.5022742790884
Felton entered Milady’s apartment. Milady arose.	451.3817322370128
“You are here!” said she.	425.40912716872776
“I promised to come,” said Felton, “and I have come.”	403.3620236226285
“You promised me something else.”	343.5553011511576
“What, my God!” said the young man, who in spite of his self-command	465.0807176570238
felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow.	478.42674125955796
“You promised to bring a knife, and to leave it with me after our	333.8153376242711
interview.”	319.60557172269563
“Say no more of that, madame,” said Felton. “There is no situation,	480.37727154855895
however terrible it may be, which can authorize a creature of God to	428.3546464737695
inflict death upon himself. I have reflected, and I cannot, must not be	348.45247774224356
guilty of such a sin.”	308.1674199428321
“Ah, you have reflected!” said the prisoner, sitting down in her	292.44446644123457
armchair, with a smile of disdain; “and I also have reflected.”	308.13446280949915
“Upon what?”	459.92263685952474
“That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word.”	310.04179985593504
“Oh, my God!” murmured Felton.	432.1552158146622
“You may retire,” said Milady. “I will not talk.”	452.9062926165062
“Here is the knife,” said Felton, drawing from his pocket the weapon	375.1074926742567
which he had brought, according to his promise, but which he hesitated	337.7267179295253
to give to his prisoner.	393.6048724883281
“Let me see it,” said Milady.	382.34422387615456
“For what purpose?”	360.17097147430286
“Upon my honor, I will instantly return it to you. You shall place it	378.9244307554565
on that table, and you may remain between it and me.”	460.23723568963874
Felton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it	473.06594209509024
attentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.	386.5778035494235
“Well,” said she, returning the knife to the young officer, “this is	476.04574476068666
fine and good steel. You are a faithful friend, Felton.”	321.6009311647483
Felton took back the weapon, and laid it upon the table, as he had	437.3197578164433
agreed with the prisoner.	422.73982492184575
Milady followed him with her eyes, and made a gesture of satisfaction.	316.7848239994643
“Now,” said she, “listen to me.”	474.81420877690266
The request was needless. The young officer stood upright before her,	460.3767283385029
awaiting her words as if to devour them.	410.50161733814673
“Felton,” said Milady, with a solemnity full of melancholy, “imagine	337.76782267965973
that your sister, the daughter of your father, speaks to you. While yet	410.78898251802264
young, unfortunately handsome, I was dragged into a snare. I resisted.	399.9325142171831
Ambushes and violences multiplied around me, but I resisted. The	420.6663992778717
religion I serve, the God I adore, were blasphemed because I called	435.210094429774
upon that religion and that God, but still I resisted. Then outrages	485.05122244561335
were heaped upon me, and as my soul was not subdued they wished to	383.86736530636085
defile my body forever. Finally—”	432.53876342374076
Milady stopped, and a bitter smile passed over her lips.	487.3429633255672
“Finally,” said Felton, “finally, what did they do?”	460.42392849921845
“At length, one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he	442.4517948362075
could not conquer. One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my	297.9872399739684
water. Scarcely had I finished my repast, when I felt myself sink by	386.46169661659286
degrees into a strange torpor. Although I was without mistrust, a vague	363.31797629446544
fear seized me, and I tried to struggle against sleepiness. I arose. I	485.61027466830274
wished to run to the window and call for help, but my legs refused	363.90800801643735
their office. It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and	405.3694675964184
crushed me with its weight. I stretched out my arms. I tried to speak.	340.4802736643812
I could only utter inarticulate sounds, and irresistible faintness came	412.62340161329814
over me. I supported myself by a chair, feeling that I was about to	384.051722638198
fall, but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak	392.30414782372907
arms. I fell upon one knee, then upon both. I tried to pray, but my	451.23709603014015
tongue was frozen. God doubtless neither heard nor saw me, and I sank	460.78078193655665
upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death.	419.22905018063557
“Of all that passed in that sleep, or the time which glided away while	452.4195622826461
it lasted, I have no remembrance. The only thing I recollect is that I	401.90935442714084
awoke in bed in a round chamber, the furniture of which was sumptuous,	466.2977185411768
and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling. No	413.3153674773174
door gave entrance to the room. It might be called a magnificent	353.1747824064769
prison.	422.88979932580975
“It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in,	323.5051595903406
or to take account of the details I describe. My mind appeared to	327.71628784040485
strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which	402.59310274300185
I could not rouse myself. I had vague perceptions of space traversed,	440.76221707126246
of the rolling of a carriage, of a horrible dream in which my strength	449.93496933587653
had become exhausted; but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my	351.9010294782748
mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine, and	471.218613199031
yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality.	337.8853927503443
“At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I	341.30980780181943
believed myself dreaming. I arose trembling. My clothes were near me on	491.0843827922948
a chair; I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed.	447.03934679039475
Then by degrees the reality broke upon me, full of chaste terrors. I	348.7720042081938
was no longer in the house where I had dwelt. As well as I could judge	393.7686488894341
by the light of the sun, the day was already two-thirds gone. It was	380.8004127720331
the evening before when I had fallen asleep; my sleep, then, must have	313.7459263690569
lasted twenty-four hours! What had taken place during this long sleep?	336.57227871000345
“I dressed myself as quickly as possible; my slow and stiff motions all	477.7171314910004
attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely	488.55872165471123
dissipated. The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a	436.22736625819084
woman; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish, but	394.1701467650574
on casting her eyes about the apartment, she would have found that wish	369.2353777504611
accomplished.	467.00475352818273
“Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this	465.3955223514711
splendid prison; but you may easily comprehend, Felton, that the more	466.2384052106837
superb the prison, the greater was my terror.	326.74086372732387
“Yes, it was a prison, for I tried in vain to get out of it. I sounded	358.7757483392314
all the walls, in the hopes of discovering a door, but everywhere the	411.7253767188761
walls returned a full and flat sound.	370.9568329377625
“I made the tour of the room at least twenty times, in search of an	459.9042998448352
outlet of some kind; but there was none. I sank exhausted with fatigue	485.85035393401483
and terror into an armchair.	301.2633128340456
“Meantime, night came on rapidly, and with night my terrors increased.	311.4073719876696
I did not know but I had better remain where I was seated. It appeared	434.9828267709074
that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to	442.6496417755634
fall at every instant. Although I had eaten nothing since the evening	382.83124373596377
before, my fears prevented my feeling hunger.	474.9014983981442
“No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me; I	395.03396769558304
only supposed it must be seven or eight o’clock in the evening, for it	439.76250359369294
was in the month of October and it was quite dark.	446.9988929241573
“All at once the noise of a door, turning on its hinges, made me start.	415.8406392244185
A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling,	432.99734763648667
casting a strong light into my chamber; and I perceived with terror	490.9437373811925
that a man was standing within a few paces of me.	389.1645475409539
“A table, with two covers, bearing a supper ready prepared, stood, as	345.3505035324493
if by magic, in the middle of the apartment.	415.80738261314093
“That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year, who had vowed	466.92060654237656
my dishonor, and who, by the first words that issued from his mouth,	462.1984598574072
gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night.”	298.42715813521966
“Scoundrel!” murmured Felton.	410.37599409949627
“Oh, yes, scoundrel!” cried Milady, seeing the interest which the young	394.4920198284894
officer, whose soul seemed to hang on her lips, took in this strange	395.08111604495025
recital. “Oh, yes, scoundrel! He believed, having triumphed over me in	431.600161131097
my sleep, that all was completed. He came, hoping that I would accept	472.35363383482996
my shame, as my shame was consummated; he came to offer his fortune in	294.14905263920565
exchange for my love.	411.87129518269614
“All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and	389.5333217444229
disdainful words, I poured out upon this man. Doubtless he was	340.1763397934602
accustomed to such reproaches, for he listened to me calm and smiling,	305.1454983790958
with his arms crossed over his breast. Then, when he thought I had said	298.9539734761709
all, he advanced toward me; I sprang toward the table, I seized a	391.1113800163998
knife, I placed it to my breast.	391.3264090874601
“Take one step more,” said I, “and in addition to my dishonor, you	437.7048869080921
shall have my death to reproach yourself with.”	367.7740966243268
“There was, no doubt, in my look, my voice, my whole person, that	319.9533549554674
sincerity of gesture, of attitude, of accent, which carries conviction	387.62526149564974
to the most perverse minds, for he paused.	306.86263641804976
“‘Your death?’ said he; ‘oh, no, you are too charming a mistress to	437.7910049381393
allow me to consent to lose you thus, after I have had the happiness to	457.40590431504086
possess you only a single time. Adieu, my charmer; I will wait to pay	479.5539831613577
you my next visit till you are in a better humor.’	309.8158129191728
“At these words he blew a whistle; the globe of fire which lighted the	343.34560489662465
room reascended and disappeared. I found myself again in complete	383.2339340348045
darkness. The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated	318.4400651789267
the instant afterward; the flaming globe descended afresh, and I was	385.2905274736964
completely alone.	361.4539674614645
“This moment was frightful; if I had any doubts as to my misfortune,	445.4003373165249
these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality. I was in the	377.35519121001204
power of a man whom I not only detested, but despised—of a man capable	387.14866225647137
of anything, and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was	313.8342276093048
able to do.”	323.44401199412204
“But who, then, was this man?” asked Felton.	293.1518310866955
“I passed the night on a chair, starting at the least noise, for toward	297.13664101626244
midnight the lamp went out, and I was again in darkness. But the night	415.6442982480286
passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor. Day	323.32151836452744
came; the table had disappeared, only I had still the knife in my hand.	402.22529558742383
“This knife was my only hope.	386.77864719464503
“I was worn out with fatigue. Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes; I had not	315.099172236296
dared to sleep a single instant. The light of day reassured me; I went	373.3885691310566
and threw myself on the bed, without parting with the emancipating	437.83827667040276
knife, which I concealed under my pillow.	459.4159405867995
“When I awoke, a fresh meal was served.	336.1257604256108
“This time, in spite of my terrors, in spite of my agony, I began to	480.8493062009703
feel a devouring hunger. It was forty-eight hours since I had taken any	421.69187852164754
nourishment. I ate some bread and some fruit; then, remembering the	434.5297282522282
narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk, I would not touch that which	347.18358505730953
was placed on the table, but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed	344.0239944321108
in the wall over my dressing table.	468.16537664205487
“And yet, notwithstanding these precautions, I remained for some time	378.8348888465275
in a terrible agitation of mind. But my fears were this time	460.91217376852734
ill-founded; I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind	350.77560976744314
I dreaded.	464.57238062506997
“I took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_, in order that my	399.40126847819914
suspicions might not be noticed.	473.8440335282286
“The evening came on, and with it darkness; but however profound was	412.2809083707149
this darkness, my eyes began to accustom themselves to it. I saw, amid	407.79893659404934
the shadows, the table sink through the floor; a quarter of an hour	351.26100069771644
later it reappeared, bearing my supper. In an instant, thanks to the	316.5713163049554
lamp, my chamber was once more lighted.	308.7259938912281
“I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have	395.5188387284065
anything soporific introduced into them. Two eggs and some fruit	365.6831129544264
composed my repast; then I drew another glass of water from my	423.3638238211036
protecting fountain, and drank it.	418.30102207862876
“At the first swallow, it appeared to me not to have the same taste as	487.94374597440054
in the morning. Suspicion instantly seized me. I paused, but I had	470.52119267078024
already drunk half a glass.	441.9180093325091
“I threw the rest away with horror, and waited, with the dew of fear	341.9139487907153
upon my brow.	394.0444530613703
“No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that	431.8521512357894
fountain, and had taken advantage of my confidence in it, the better to	328.6444460482715
assure my ruin, so coolly resolved upon, so cruelly pursued.	362.10755166989514
“Half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear;	351.31261850904286
but as I had only drunk half a glass of the water, I contended longer,	401.36732537160776
and instead of falling entirely asleep, I sank into a state of	346.29223606438364
drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me,	294.91169045531086
while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly.	308.68046400618437
“I dragged myself toward the bed, to seek the only defense I had	376.47774814811066
left—my saving knife; but I could not reach the bolster. I sank on my	378.1996477474696
knees, my hands clasped round one of the bedposts; then I felt that I	393.9944324681469
was lost.”	329.1646676416195
Felton became frightfully pale, and a convulsive tremor crept through	407.4135324236296
his whole body.	477.211126665275
“And what was most frightful,” continued Milady, her voice altered, as	471.53961088263463
if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute, “was	488.5458912590742
that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that	490.6270395388346
threatened me; was that my soul, if I may say so, waked in my sleeping	364.06241268467926
body; was that I saw, that I heard. It is true that all was like a	336.0907524400045
dream, but it was not the less frightful.	488.9640919242041
“I saw the lamp ascend, and leave me in darkness; then I heard the	362.1416938159824
well-known creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but	339.7058160748235
twice.	326.47075787637334
“I felt instinctively that someone approached me; it is said that the	412.2048129109196
doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the	412.49614357619157
serpent.	482.1865819769848
“I wished to make an effort; I attempted to cry out. By an incredible	389.59418079281653
effort of will I even raised myself up, but only to sink down again	352.71144880714627
immediately, and to fall into the arms of my persecutor.”	358.83400491308583
“Tell me who this man was!” cried the young officer.	364.40391821747505
Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in	442.7943348113986
Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital; but she would not	425.23924779996867
spare him a single pang. The more profoundly she wounded his heart, the	389.63228917535037
more certainly he would avenge her. She continued, then, as if she had	391.5558983903271
not heard his exclamation, or as if she thought the moment was not yet	354.7927702468236
come to reply to it.	466.4569003166388
“Only this time it was no longer an inert body, without feeling, that	353.33865212918573
the villain had to deal with. I have told you that without being able	334.67412518650235
to regain the complete exercise of my faculties, I retained the sense	331.1592368610667
of my danger. I struggled, then, with all my strength, and doubtless	424.3435557056116
opposed, weak as I was, a long resistance, for I heard him cry out,	345.20832284759854
‘These miserable Puritans! I knew very well that they tired out their	313.180771535184
executioners, but I did not believe them so strong against their	329.9588362655722
lovers!’	480.9501598769692
“Alas! this desperate resistance could not last long. I felt my	455.0863586625281
strength fail, and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the	486.8592297925493
coward to prevail, but my swoon.”	488.7525616654747
Felton listened without uttering any word or sound, except an inward	353.2349158152091
expression of agony. The sweat streamed down his marble forehead, and	365.1174419496254
his hand, under his coat, tore his breast.	376.4718792012065
“My first impulse, on coming to myself, was to feel under my pillow for	467.631663441926
the knife I had not been able to reach; if it had not been useful for	313.20458492699186
defense, it might at least serve for expiation.	381.2127084488844
“But on taking this knife, Felton, a terrible idea occurred to me. I	313.6870094870512
have sworn to tell you all, and I will tell you all. I have promised	477.9036566295185
you the truth; I will tell it, were it to destroy me.”	305.8142094312227
“The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man, did it	307.02833757311157
not?” cried Felton.	331.49946227062884
“Yes,” said Milady. “The idea was not that of a Christian, I knew; but	488.03973322099404
without doubt, that eternal enemy of our souls, that lion roaring	456.04888987556683
constantly around us, breathed it into my mind. In short, what shall I	380.55556732419234
say to you, Felton?” continued Milady, in the tone of a woman accusing	357.04113981500893
herself of a crime. “This idea occurred to me, and did not leave me; it	359.4083837183905
is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment.”	433.6512156503841
“Continue, continue!” said Felton; “I am eager to see you attain your	490.02728081926995
vengeance!”	491.94982547379925
“Oh, I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible. I had no	298.21189653853514
doubt he would return the following night. During the day I had nothing	471.30092366874544
to fear.	475.9047963508077
“When the hour of breakfast came, therefore, I did not hesitate to eat	425.3201187096599
and drink. I had determined to make believe sup, but to eat nothing. I	374.9710222637566
was forced, then, to combat the fast of the evening with the	299.55875649130905
nourishment of the morning.	433.6862001806331
“Only I concealed a glass of water, which remained after my breakfast,	357.01705867549344
thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained	407.1477819132176
forty-eight hours without eating or drinking.	448.9425455775676
“The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to	348.81615305537156
strengthen the resolution I had formed; only I took care that my face	392.9278460265664
should not betray the thoughts of my heart, for I had no doubt I was	423.73058438903035
watched. Several times, even, I felt a smile on my lips. Felton, I dare	464.38782452704254
not tell you at what idea I smiled; you would hold me in horror—”	369.72036088204334
“Go on! go on!” said Felton; “you see plainly that I listen, and that I	411.0275742137104
am anxious to know the end.”	338.5487005814747
“Evening came; the ordinary events took place. During the darkness, as	436.4537670649969
before, my supper was brought. Then the lamp was lighted, and I sat	324.2795067080546
down to table. I only ate some fruit. I pretended to pour out water	339.87493434068335
from the jug, but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass. The	487.47527410306895
substitution was made so carefully that my spies, if I had any, could	445.55271450181317
have no suspicion of it.	410.9958901395101
“After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding	402.6334952511566
evening; but this time, as I yielded to fatigue, or as if I had become	294.5618082516663
familiarized with danger, I dragged myself toward my bed, let my robe	375.1934207667173
fall, and lay down.	308.67710469717184
“I found my knife where I had placed it, under my pillow, and while	398.1926078098961
feigning to sleep, my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively.	464.3994033144206
“Two hours passed away without anything fresh happening. Oh, my God!	430.87825514265637
who could have said so the evening before? I began to fear that he	471.52992047267793
would not come.	482.4789183919527
“At length I saw the lamp rise softly, and disappear in the depths of	480.32001495106294
the ceiling; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity, but I	391.57509831514767
made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity.	342.35551230176884
“Nearly ten minutes passed; I heard no other noise but the beating of	470.45627480075007
my own heart. I implored heaven that he might come.	342.66408843204636
“At length I heard the well-known noise of the door, which opened and	302.21460322462275
shut; I heard, notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet, a step	319.35483066897814
which made the floor creak; I saw, notwithstanding the darkness, a	332.4354647050577
shadow which approached my bed.”	486.524514380866
“Haste! haste!” said Felton; “do you not see that each of your words	332.79946712689207
burns me like molten lead?”	364.7752367923035
“Then,” continued Milady, “then I collected all my strength; I recalled	327.5924493568665
to my mind that the moment of vengeance, or rather, of justice, had	332.46167340193324
struck. I looked upon myself as another Judith; I gathered myself up,	371.054320726976
my knife in my hand, and when I saw him near me, stretching out his	397.61743971514574
arms to find his victim, then, with the last cry of agony and despair,	328.2901195870876
I struck him in the middle of his breast.	341.61306329227756
“The miserable villain! He had foreseen all. His breast was covered	316.65692764526324
with a coat-of-mail; the knife was bent against it.	390.67484263391134
“‘Ah, ah!’ cried he, seizing my arm, and wresting from me the weapon	392.7193813044221
that had so badly served me, ‘you want to take my life, do you, my	381.1242455032467
pretty Puritan? But that’s more than dislike, that’s ingratitude! Come,	478.06383033201973
come, calm yourself, my sweet girl! I thought you had softened. I am	485.507640612567
not one of those tyrants who detain women by force. You don’t love me.	311.7310427962279
With my usual fatuity I doubted it; now I am convinced. Tomorrow you	389.55855274453586
shall be free.’	296.1305521569149
“I had but one wish; that was that he should kill me.	442.7489388110969
“‘Beware!’ said I, ‘for my liberty is your dishonor.’	310.2040670053095
“‘Explain yourself, my pretty sibyl!’	319.5857555835872
“‘Yes; for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything. I will	457.02688240884606
proclaim the violence you have used toward me. I will describe my	340.219759577985
captivity. I will denounce this place of infamy. You are placed on	390.8474444722811
high, my Lord, but tremble! Above you there is the king; above the king	472.3448074788221
there is God!’	344.62964694957464
“However perfect master he was over himself, my persecutor allowed a	415.27499384028044
movement of anger to escape him. I could not see the expression of his	322.0882036864803
countenance, but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed.	343.30889645981193
“‘Then you shall not leave this place,’ said he.	392.47774241811635
“‘Very well,’ cried I, ‘then the place of my punishment will be that of	309.4884346078623
my tomb. I will die here, and you will see if a phantom that accuses is	293.5917396543404
not more terrible than a living being that threatens!’	396.29159991648635
“‘You shall have no weapon left in your power.’	328.7756434008249
“‘There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every	301.36000498247915
creature who has the courage to use it. I will allow myself to die with	316.4010030585326
hunger.’	473.7416348243048
“‘Come,’ said the wretch, ‘is not peace much better than such a war as	458.51955756872565
that? I will restore you to liberty this moment; I will proclaim you a	460.5621797684255
piece of immaculate virtue; I will name you the Lucretia of England.’	341.28151989646875
“‘And I will say that you are the Sextus. I will denounce you before	426.0206042368464
men, as I have denounced you before God; and if it be necessary that,	401.66899406118597
like Lucretia, I should sign my accusation with my blood, I will sign	305.0932886447064
it.’	338.89057577705347
“‘Ah!’ said my enemy, in a jeering tone, ‘that’s quite another thing.	396.7573449642296
My faith! everything considered, you are very well off here. You shall	476.39457514724563
want for nothing, and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be	321.8629495189566
your own fault.’	383.208992029284
“At these words he retired. I heard the door open and shut, and I	315.0438951707367
remained overwhelmed, less, I confess it, by my grief than by the	454.29809852583367
mortification of not having avenged myself.	298.7263053116228
“He kept his word. All the day, all the next night passed away without	394.9682853147346
my seeing him again. But I also kept my word with him, and I neither	393.010125099226
ate nor drank. I was, as I told him, resolved to die of hunger.	343.8680638702266
“I passed the day and the night in prayer, for I hoped that God would	342.5343039810895
pardon me my suicide.	333.4752694158323
“The second night the door opened; I was lying on the floor, for my	324.48139179564475
strength began to abandon me.	356.5714501211204
“At the noise I raised myself up on one hand.	404.7316486197608
“‘Well,’ said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear	331.57287095280094
not to be recognized, ‘well! Are we softened a little? Will we not pay	422.98874374574336
for our liberty with a single promise of silence? Come, I am a good	463.7640489936623
sort of a prince,’ added he, ‘and although I like not Puritans I do	414.3186701589657
them justice; and it is the same with Puritanesses, when they are	468.48201574211976
pretty. Come, take a little oath for me on the cross; I won’t ask	440.73649220991507
anything more of you.’	425.0427308679375
“‘On the cross,’ cried I, rising, for at that abhorred voice I had	382.50124956513434
recovered all my strength, ‘on the cross I swear that no promise, no	404.67643424786
menace, no force, no torture, shall close my mouth! On the cross I	329.940848741482
swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer, as a thief of honor, as	341.58490436725197
a base coward! On the cross I swear, if I ever leave this place, to	384.38887275665985
call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race!’	427.597096892359
“‘Beware!’ said the voice, in a threatening accent that I had never yet	458.00471540325196
heard. ‘I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in	426.1310989091969
the last extremity to close your mouth, or at least to prevent anyone	312.4417973066491
from believing a word you may utter.’	314.81312082967133
“I mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter.	435.052673730365
“He saw that it was a merciless war between us—a war to the death.	370.2670981145301
“‘Listen!’ said he. ‘I give you the rest of tonight and all day	381.57891032661666
tomorrow. Reflect: promise to be silent, and riches, consideration,	323.30210224928
even honor, shall surround you; threaten to speak, and I will condemn	451.63300844002936
you to infamy.’	298.38932935916176
“‘You?’ cried I. ‘You?’	420.0834484108998
“‘To interminable, ineffaceable infamy!’	433.3922630036127
“‘You?’ repeated I. Oh, I declare to you, Felton, I thought him mad!	463.9543232592125
“‘Yes, yes, I!’ replied he.	436.6031436954835
“‘Oh, leave me!’ said I. ‘Begone, if you do not desire to see me dash	351.95955824119693
my head against that wall before your eyes!’	363.43139595661677
“‘Very well, it is your own doing. Till tomorrow evening, then!’	478.81454499187305
“‘Till tomorrow evening, then!’ replied I, allowing myself to fall, and	460.3224060760536
biting the carpet with rage.”	373.2534159733362
Felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture; and Milady saw,	477.9003001554279
with the joy of a demon, that his strength would fail him perhaps	348.6498665137531
before the end of her recital.	412.3807160159183
Chapter LVII.	350.1775944101671
MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY	444.8517401409137
After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man	306.020559490673
who listened to her, Milady continued her recital.	418.3835865621581
“It was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything. I	396.63039566813535
suffered frightful torments. At times there passed before me clouds	464.03778279332096
which pressed my brow, which veiled my eyes; this was delirium.	379.24352856679013
“When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I	397.8799993236749
thanked God, for I thought I was about to die.	454.2722549891554
“In the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open. Terror	472.2937066335811
recalled me to myself.	371.57123251380233
“He entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask. He was masked	429.2105775377712
likewise; but I knew his step, I knew his voice, I knew him by that	314.7292414923155
imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse	453.84014280712205
of humanity.	417.81594931473415
“‘Well,’ said he to me, ‘have you made your mind up to take the oath I	292.87031405026954
requested of you?’	459.73868694593534
“‘You have said Puritans have but one word. Mine you have heard, and	472.0854109188962
that is to pursue you—on earth to the tribunal of men, in heaven to the	295.17025198249434
tribunal of God.’	350.9398109555182
“‘You persist, then?’	361.61863138996887
“‘I swear it before the God who hears me. I will take the whole world	306.49125878754336
as a witness of your crime, and that until I have found an avenger.’	381.25507549912174
“‘You are a prostitute,’ said he, in a voice of thunder, ‘and you shall	482.16125749446803
undergo the punishment of prostitutes! Branded in the eyes of the world	352.6547253829072
you invoke, try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor	338.99821725389324
mad!’	319.1420685986258
“Then, addressing the man who accompanied him, ‘Executioner,’ said he,	318.1974560605284
‘do your duty.’”	443.1533062083535
“Oh, his name, his name!” cried Felton. “His name, tell it me!”	302.5024094244798
“Then in spite of my cries, in spite of my resistance—for I began to	314.77616451090546
comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death—the	378.74455732483614
executioner seized me, threw me on the floor, fastened me with his	372.0671840965742
bonds, and suffocated by sobs, almost without sense, invoking God, who	399.1286637141726
did not listen to me, I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and	296.05481513931096
shame. A burning fire, a red-hot iron, the iron of the executioner, was	437.7167485147836
imprinted on my shoulder.”	309.6132141705516
Felton uttered a groan.	349.77767359611926
“Here,” said Milady, rising with the majesty of a queen, “here, Felton,	488.1056541800463
behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl, the victim of	349.075559668021
the brutality of a villain. Learn to know the heart of men, and	343.3238465983461
henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust	358.8830665116093
vengeance.”	375.41284747859095
Milady, with a rapid gesture, opened her robe, tore the cambric that	305.41436163451385
covered her bosom, and red with feigned anger and simulated shame,	490.51252040542425
showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that	476.4079455562772
beautiful shoulder.	371.78986094298
“But,” cried Felton, “that is a _fleur-de-lis_ which I see there.”	432.1592466564929
“And therein consisted the infamy,” replied Milady. “The brand of	378.9604149742948
England!—it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on	439.33506752493565
me, and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the	442.0069325371224
kingdom; but the brand of France!—oh, by that, by _that_ I was branded	321.0819717043327
indeed!”	422.2143189599816
This was too much for Felton.	337.69908994629975
Pale, motionless, overwhelmed by this frightful revelation, dazzled by	310.7286847301936
the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him	328.1664452800857
with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime, he ended by falling on	331.9206105640028
his knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and	407.4108450526137
holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus	341.4459154799501
to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace. The brand disappeared;	441.5790224386327
the beauty alone remained.	453.78667227396954
“Pardon! Pardon!” cried Felton, “oh, pardon!”	377.272296552119
Milady read in his eyes _love! love!_	309.73796374757575
“Pardon for what?” asked she.	393.4576962410793
“Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors.”	340.57775653580404
Milady held out her hand to him.	391.49417220880844
“So beautiful! so young!” cried Felton, covering that hand with his	459.2227226889578
kisses.	490.29995038812547
Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a	365.9534275281805
king.	412.5472130145771
Felton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her	490.9013525710477
feet.	430.24641334183855
He no longer loved her; he adored her.	355.57466101562267
When this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her	379.5619012085975
self-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her	427.8804696768606
recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were	339.98479860491
only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he	454.92415267849026
said, “Ah, now! I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name	444.8769665067319
of your true executioner. For to me there is but one; the other was an	324.8651630738384
instrument, that was all.”	451.10772626697843
“What, brother!” cried Milady, “must I name him again? Have you not yet	427.6238248734801
divined who he is?”	422.8669816154142
“What?” cried Felton, “he—again he—always he? What—the truly guilty?”	368.7868655051653
“The truly guilty,” said Milady, “is the ravager of England, the	385.7179204684354
persecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many	469.38158820404226
women—he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to	311.0113387659878
make England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and	292.10368930988085
will betray them tomorrow—”	436.74548951404597
“Buckingham! It is, then, Buckingham!” cried Felton, in a high state of	353.5666825328672
excitement.	330.75229124311466
Milady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the	399.2930246965031
shame which this name recalled to her.	300.4780788560683
“Buckingham, the executioner of this angelic creature!” cried Felton.	377.9676618021081
“And thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him, my God! And thou hast	350.6000268643799
left him noble, honored, powerful, for the ruin of us all!”	405.63475044417277
“God abandons him who abandons himself,” said Milady.	372.6928739352186
“But he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the	488.4562223824818
damned!” said Felton, with increasing exultation. “He wills that human	308.86105856803624
vengeance should precede celestial justice.”	469.0897019060154
“Men fear him and spare him.”	360.17533083461996
“I,” said Felton, “I do not fear him, nor will I spare him.”	480.6143944839808
The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy.	355.24008699103996
“But how can Lord de Winter, my protector, my father,” asked Felton,	389.941516072347
“possibly be mixed up with all this?”	303.2324289927274
“Listen, Felton,” resumed Milady, “for by the side of base and	334.3645629684904
contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures. I	380.74853219190464
had an affianced husband, a man whom I loved, and who loved me—a heart	412.10182941681046
like yours, Felton, a man like you. I went to him and told him all; he	406.1959875891303
knew me, that man did, and did not doubt an instant. He was a nobleman,	377.0522937697407
a man equal to Buckingham in every respect. He said nothing; he only	330.49326781560114
girded on his sword, wrapped himself in his cloak, and went straight to	421.4744099678992
Buckingham Palace.	369.83114869477055
“Yes, yes,” said Felton; “I understand how he would act. But with such	319.63299491932133
men it is not the sword that should be employed; it is the poniard.”	379.9604122918733
“Buckingham had left England the day before, sent as ambassador to	437.0272568127034
Spain, to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I., who was	346.5234340690516
then only Prince of Wales. My affianced husband returned.	336.1229771576482
“‘Hear me,’ said he; ‘this man has gone, and for the moment has	378.757657808139
consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to	359.50000628998777
have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own	408.16681863568306
honor and that of his wife.’”	447.49724531657796
“Lord de Winter!” cried Felton.	351.11569623671875
“Yes,” said Milady, “Lord de Winter; and now you can understand it all,	418.0616655937156
can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before	409.91262751447636
his return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came	297.4148799949423
the blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I	364.1260448818003
accuse nobody.”	443.2948440489931
“Oh, what an abyss; what an abyss!” cried Felton.	459.8113429638787
“Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The	442.9924914835978
terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of	355.6972798135856
thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain	336.093588790471
this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was	481.9108417222186
sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in	397.3655277316176
his hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to	444.8380850967863
remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England.	429.597875018838
Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I	305.30361320792014
was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at	328.02795935023516
Portsmouth.”	340.46076615603
“Well?” said Felton.	325.55338798493403
“Well; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke	341.1616058878322
of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him	383.8870547954319
that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman. The noble and	402.0141916473276
pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me. Lord de	315.3462729549178
Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that	351.1925716368665
it was his interest to believe it. He caused me to be arrested, had me	368.5653187706221
conducted hither, and placed me under your guard. You know the rest.	403.2028476792857
The day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after	389.6227992263613
tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous. Oh, the train is well laid;	333.8942748322514
the plot is clever. My honor will not survive it! You see, then,	444.4831396623779
Felton, I can do nothing but die. Felton, give me that knife!”	460.3860587943258
And at these words, as if all her strength was exhausted, Milady sank,	470.285423454275
weak and languishing, into the arms of the young officer, who,	324.8186748907363
intoxicated with love, anger, and voluptuous sensations hitherto	416.8151855637975
unknown, received her with transport, pressed her against his heart,	300.7452468391664
all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth, bewildered by the	454.430212345438
contact with that palpitating bosom.	305.29541732116013
“No, no,” said he. “No, you shall live honored and pure; you shall live	314.628701117104
to triumph over your enemies.”	424.84198265985333
Milady put him from her slowly with her hand, while drawing him nearer	491.5928289985749
with her look; but Felton, in his turn, embraced her more closely,	394.44423385193033
imploring her like a divinity.	369.2975600537807
“Oh, death, death!” said she, lowering her voice and her eyelids, “oh,	445.7648691149129
death, rather than shame! Felton, my brother, my friend, I conjure	347.65723398366316
you!”	394.58876058479126
“No,” cried Felton, “no; you shall live and you shall be avenged.”	480.98649963490294
“Felton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me! Felton, abandon me!	370.7791254228329
Felton, let me die!”	464.0338228387683
“Well, then, we will live and die together!” cried he, pressing his	392.9818111678228
lips to those of the prisoner.	415.6144323828913
Several strokes resounded on the door; this time Milady really pushed	417.5512944895785
him away from her.	292.39414673190595
“Hark,” said she, “we have been overheard! Someone is coming! All is	469.38566186813193
over! We are lost!”	346.68137502078537
“No,” said Felton; it is only the sentinel warning me that they are	396.7578141128178
about to change the guard.”	371.39119966959476
“Then run to the door, and open it yourself.”	401.3155949023014
Felton obeyed; this woman was now his whole thought, his whole soul.	455.2487132837542
He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a	316.1843601319244
watch-patrol.	397.1639377151126
“Well, what is the matter?” asked the young lieutenant.	407.63232946048896
“You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out,” said the	320.0053107497896
soldier; “but you forgot to leave me the key. I heard you cry out,	361.6793658605127
without understanding what you said. I tried to open the door, but it	476.3699204764443
was locked inside; then I called the sergeant.”	395.53762525723664
“And here I am,” said the sergeant.	380.9552670451185
Felton, quite bewildered, almost mad, stood speechless.	427.53901810239097
Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the	375.9327584222011
scene. She ran to the table, and seizing the knife which Felton had	302.07389206535186
laid down, exclaimed, “And by what right will you prevent me from	305.68775679543023
dying?”	479.99483685915175
“Great God!” exclaimed Felton, on seeing the knife glitter in her hand.	478.4768495697938
At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	461.01166364727897
corridor. The baron, attracted by the noise, in his chamber gown, his	387.51156264821634
sword under his arm, stood in the doorway.	332.1281723282972
“Ah,” said he, “here we are, at the last act of the tragedy. You see,	401.72717490392114
Felton, the drama has gone through all the phases I named; but be easy,	328.5004758082829
no blood will flow.”	454.9096244317865
Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate	322.65999760576295
and terrible proof of her courage.	482.59980539811306
“You are mistaken, my Lord, blood will flow; and may that blood fall	442.1833976018267
back on those who cause it to flow!”	476.3731909951805
Felton uttered a cry, and rushed toward her. He was too late; Milady	308.02508407248655
had stabbed herself.	384.82017711592397
But the knife had fortunately, we ought to say skillfully, come in	482.8380053296688
contact with the steel busk, which at that period, like a cuirass,	488.27322642183026
defended the chests of women. It had glided down it, tearing the robe,	403.78529414545983
and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs. Milady’s	404.157637288551
robe was not the less stained with blood in a second.	338.048075073466
Milady fell down, and seemed to be in a swoon.	318.3158646610672
Felton snatched away the knife.	412.70103776878204
“See, my Lord,” said he, in a deep, gloomy tone, “here is a woman who	448.19098990337
was under my guard, and who has killed herself!”	442.06450171133247
“Be at ease, Felton,” said Lord de Winter. “She is not dead; demons do	459.1262092192778
not die so easily. Be tranquil, and go wait for me in my chamber.”	350.15481769253375
“But, my Lord—”	417.3408858694219
“Go, sir, I command you!”	300.8948304990733
At this injunction from his superior, Felton obeyed; but in going out,	293.9141695371596
he put the knife into his bosom.	432.6842118173514
As to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who	301.77404961335355
waited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner,	451.6962885250254
who was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone.	458.84343504371645
Meanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions, as	422.9753444255999
the wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to	402.34161033551186
find a physician.	301.27247999115747
Chapter LVIII.	453.2067728249574
ESCAPE	440.79901765892623
As Lord de Winter had thought, Milady’s wound was not dangerous. So	310.3266235286927
soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned	431.03108421501975
to her assistance she opened her eyes.	419.7965300795083
It was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain—not a very	432.0737016372052
difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady. Thus the poor	326.76588528560296
woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner, whom, notwithstanding	491.3689100369959
her hints, she persisted in watching all night.	366.8218415318955
But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking.	441.2142755328133
There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers.	412.5300754618813
If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he	437.5357559876114
would take him, in the mental disposition in which he now found	426.8319996906898
himself, for a messenger sent by the devil.	489.7877204526698
Milady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope—her	435.6394241777533
only means of safety.	316.7351975334285
But Lord de Winter might suspect him; Felton himself might now be	355.59836771908044
watched!	430.2990429439399
Toward four o’clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the	461.6156381456065
time Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The	293.53319953135616
doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of	411.3284078145845
it; he only satisfied himself by Milady’s pulse that the case was not	345.92610572865516
serious.	354.3251187670778
In the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in	422.54136763573877
the night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her.	296.8615304295419
She had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast	463.55902329644516
hour; but Felton did not come.	406.5178970600797
Were her fears realized? Was Felton, suspected by the baron, about to	443.9469840347868
fail her at the decisive moment? She had only one day left. Lord de	320.3077038134499
Winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third, and it was	327.1832578410822
now the morning of the twenty-second.	489.05947698633935
Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner.	367.0629778552259
Although she had eaten nothing in the morning, the dinner was brought	417.214114945
in at its usual time. Milady then perceived, with terror, that the	452.33305067584405
uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed.	364.27871326719145
Then she ventured to ask what had become of Felton.	324.8888012805488
She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback.	367.65521091448875
She inquired if the baron was still at the castle. The soldier replied	361.6558210561536
that he was, and that he had given orders to be informed if the	339.059278426357
prisoner wished to speak to him.	328.10838894519884
Milady replied that she was too weak at present, and that her only	488.0403099535548
desire was to be left alone.	407.18556836892276
The soldier went out, leaving the dinner served.	318.30460910435727
Felton was sent away. The marines were removed. Felton was then	376.16539708345084
mistrusted.	400.356754341178
This was the last blow to the prisoner.	312.75679038466296
Left alone, she arose. The bed, which she had kept from prudence and	345.8652262398803
that they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of	340.67569162915845
fire. She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed	444.39500409469497
over the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might	455.8361190528671
still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.	436.8862390039648
Milady smiled with joy. She was free now to give way to her transports	410.313538368581
without being observed. She traversed her chamber with the excitement	489.0826128724085
of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage. _Certes_,	382.25366799242863
if the knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought,	332.40085579499
not of killing herself, but of killing the baron.	332.67627249629413
At six o’clock Lord de Winter came in. He was armed at all points. This	349.2499526991444
man, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple	333.0434371183991
gentleman, had become an admirable jailer. He appeared to foresee all,	395.7168249684876
to divine all, to anticipate all.	445.061578731969
A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	417.9924806997036
mind.	428.5700332722216
“Ay!” said he, “I see; but you shall not kill me today. You have no	301.5479719583144
longer a weapon; and besides, I am on my guard. You had begun to	327.0488313734019
pervert my poor Felton. He was yielding to your infernal influence; but	437.37119529577
I will save him. He will never see you again; all is over. Get your	378.75892497539803
clothes together. Tomorrow you will go. I had fixed the embarkation for	359.420569983909
the twenty-fourth; but I have reflected that the more promptly the	370.68204345802724
affair takes place the more sure it will be. Tomorrow, by twelve	432.04006946349267
o’clock, I shall have the order for your exile, signed, _Buckingham_.	368.251178927797
If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship, my	430.68565140506416
sergeant will blow your brains out. He has orders to do so. If when on	436.6153644661193
the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits	338.78566198410016
you, the captain will have you thrown into the sea. That is agreed	399.1122430313535
upon.	386.5728464380417
“_Au revoir_, then; that is all I have to say today. Tomorrow I will	475.02946637352323
see you again, to take my leave.” With these words the baron went out.	386.570326276742
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain	364.86656356827046
on her lips, but rage in her heart.	466.6434486917192
Supper was served. Milady felt that she stood in need of all her	433.73360333440434
strength. She did not know what might take place during this night	338.9418962273865
which approached so menacingly—for large masses of cloud rolled over	468.3521587855
the face of the sky, and distant lightning announced a storm.	466.571456719461
The storm broke about ten o’clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing	413.5861229871501
nature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the	321.90964217246244
air like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her that	299.35346288857176
the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the	436.84656293551757
branches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the	373.0585380726802
hurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature,	303.3378700225086
which also seemed to groan with despair.	421.96419715307303
All at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash	486.61468191031764
of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.	397.6707611556693
She ran to the window and opened it.	422.1284115326232
“Felton!” cried she. “I am saved.”	389.55071198330575
“Yes,” said Felton; “but silence, silence! I must have time to file	433.21333746470714
through these bars. Only take care that I am not seen through the	451.33466980317644
wicket.”	311.5560922589709
“Oh, it is a proof that the Lord is on our side, Felton,” replied	312.0146264169358
Milady. “They have closed up the grating with a board.”	354.43140155456507
“That is well; God has made them senseless,” said Felton.	485.25367156782625
“But what must I do?” asked Milady.	381.67913187270506
“Nothing, nothing, only shut the window. Go to bed, or at least lie	394.0555422572985
down in your clothes. As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the	460.52042139893877
panes of glass. But will you be able to follow me?”	305.63342353894416
“Oh, yes!”	392.5431018449991
“Your wound?”	363.67477242782684
“Gives me pain, but will not prevent my walking.”	464.64859519745403
“Be ready, then, at the first signal.”	442.46379662482275
Milady shut the window, extinguished the lamp, and went, as Felton had	452.6739024438557
desired her, to lie down on the bed. Amid the moaning of the storm she	407.6237308747688
heard the grinding of the file upon the bars, and by the light of every	328.09234330002084
flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes.	461.47164751173193
She passed an hour without breathing, panting, with a cold sweat upon	303.41929972254405
her brow, and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement	310.9689947377594
she heard in the corridor.	403.19684056503
There are hours which last a year.	465.4575905558926
At the expiration of an hour, Felton tapped again.	327.13012725729317
Milady sprang out of bed and opened the window. Two bars removed formed	354.2631553083216
an opening for a man to pass through.	306.95866548939813
“Are you ready?” asked Felton.	315.24311565949904
“Yes. Must I take anything with me?”	306.4270694754251
“Money, if you have any.”	321.3181137211913
“Yes; fortunately they have left me all I had.”	454.38505954501
“So much the better, for I have expended all mine in chartering a	390.6519323117563
vessel.”	376.159059587871
“Here!” said Milady, placing a bag full of louis in Felton’s hands.	451.3080009361202
Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall.	447.31871535166647
“Now,” said he, “will you come?”	339.1458368026115
“I am ready.”	421.79380800528077
Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body	353.67951529319885
through the window. She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss	387.89336485755234
by a ladder of ropes. For the first time an emotion of terror reminded	319.7449145753244
her that she was a woman.	490.6979182978263
The dark space frightened her.	475.51664161481904
“I expected this,” said Felton.	465.20835816139225
“It’s nothing, it’s nothing!” said Milady. “I will descend with my eyes	474.8452447896019
shut.”	473.05828216788007
“Have you confidence in me?” said Felton.	455.9362665957042
“You ask that?”	391.12729332197375
“Put your two hands together. Cross them; that’s right!”	412.37807988072257
Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then	481.8034552007671
with a cord over the handkerchief.	410.31287182184263
“What are you doing?” asked Milady, with surprise.	298.3965578333558
“Pass your arms around my neck, and fear nothing.”	382.62640072480804
“But I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to	364.59441462856125
pieces.”	443.31004834020814
“Don’t be afraid. I am a sailor.”	482.7335796180357
Not a second was to be lost. Milady passed her two arms round Felton’s	432.8333028642649
neck, and let herself slip out of the window. Felton began to descend	435.7244178915634
the ladder slowly, step by step. Despite the weight of two bodies, the	396.0518761146097
blast of the hurricane shook them in the air.	366.28525976392405
All at once Felton stopped.	490.7040925364847
“What is the matter?” asked Milady.	319.09946382027357
“Silence,” said Felton, “I hear footsteps.”	474.90167342991214
“We are discovered!”	312.11089652727344
There was a silence of several seconds.	367.81408038824634
“No,” said Felton, “it is nothing.”	296.60290932100185
“But what, then, is the noise?”	377.88276923551336
“That of the patrol going their rounds.”	324.15312035996004
“Where is their road?”	443.1553219028455
“Just under us.”	381.62230237796456
“They will discover us!”	405.62958108517057
“No, if it does not lighten.”	416.18974945957746
“But they will run against the bottom of the ladder.”	445.47791141807653
“Fortunately it is too short by six feet.”	460.32144038184816
“Here they are! My God!”	418.37232935815433
“Silence!”	296.4724573380308
Both remained suspended, motionless and breathless, within twenty paces	450.12076081601487
of the ground, while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and	326.10204954808955
talking. This was a terrible moment for the fugitives.	361.5369789325945
The patrol passed. The noise of their retreating footsteps and the	414.80171008726654
murmur of their voices soon died away.	361.3130467533187
“Now,” said Felton, “we are safe.”	403.31878909411137
Milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted.	328.94210645771784
Felton continued to descend. Near the bottom of the ladder, when he	396.75134648160923
found no more support for his feet, he clung with his hands; at length,	463.0556435798423
arrived at the last step, he let himself hang by the strength of his	422.2688414779932
wrists, and touched the ground. He stooped down, picked up the bag of	411.06302336354673
money, and placed it between his teeth. Then he took Milady in his	320.5388083046392
arms, and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the	306.781875617403
patrol had taken. He soon left the pathway of the patrol, descended	403.8774539917981
across the rocks, and when arrived on the edge of the sea, whistled.	473.8540796898078
A similar signal replied to him; and five minutes after, a boat	348.8319745588675
appeared, rowed by four men.	437.7081395150941
The boat approached as near as it could to the shore; but there was not	392.27950235267895
depth enough of water for it to touch land. Felton walked into the sea	395.36448754878637
up to his middle, being unwilling to trust his precious burden to	424.8890087745848
anybody.	432.8935809488678
Fortunately the storm began to subside, but still the sea was	415.41875033387873
disturbed. The little boat bounded over the waves like a nut-shell.	372.6251308314512
“To the sloop,” said Felton, “and row quickly.”	427.9594136530666
The four men bent to their oars, but the sea was too high to let them	327.03991487177785
get much hold of it.	416.0536679390742
However, they left the castle behind; that was the principal thing. The	377.9386132702155
night was extremely dark. It was almost impossible to see the shore	450.8130269061233
from the boat; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from	338.9666467026291
the shore.	394.2622159394748
A black point floated on the sea. That was the sloop. While the boat	425.3347023084932
was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it, Felton	475.37925958091813
untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Milady’s hands	423.7528273836066
together. When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and	430.29849688913237
sprinkled it over her face.	391.26134509720407
Milady breathed a sigh, and opened her eyes.	439.085446225458
“Where am I?” said she.	467.4240502240498
“Saved!” replied the young officer.	376.7558349731047
“Oh, saved, saved!” cried she. “Yes, there is the sky; here is the sea!	481.374960075157
The air I breathe is the air of liberty! Ah, thanks, Felton, thanks!”	456.07757398546187
The young man pressed her to his heart.	299.82560783970376
“But what is the matter with my hands!” asked Milady; “it seems as if	345.6775353691215
my wrists had been crushed in a vice.”	331.2504642015656
Milady held out her arms; her wrists were bruised.	346.366667160749
“Alas!” said Felton, looking at those beautiful hands, and shaking his	486.88507567380907
head sorrowfully.	357.61444161606136
“Oh, it’s nothing, nothing!” cried Milady. “I remember now.”	360.76897240336507
Milady looked around her, as if in search of something.	416.4061448964958
“It is there,” said Felton, touching the bag of money with his foot.	299.65932039403964
They drew near to the sloop. A sailor on watch hailed the boat; the	363.46121972289535
boat replied.	457.3972152965848
“What vessel is that?” asked Milady.	491.2868991097439
“The one I have hired for you.”	350.6170854220367
“Where will it take me?”	378.8936634486921
“Where you please, after you have put me on shore at Portsmouth.”	314.16605457582347
“What are you going to do at Portsmouth?” asked Milady.	351.9716510362779
“Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,” said Felton, with a gloomy	448.69058404114014
smile.	433.6962601247102
“What orders?” asked Milady.	441.33125977667055
“You do not understand?” asked Felton.	342.7861811872507
“No; explain yourself, I beg.”	374.7127393371125
“As he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me	292.2297651977193
in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your	396.17301907312617
transportation.”	399.1977839374449
“But if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?”	323.3995094678652
“How could I know what I was the bearer of?”	422.8260262625858
“That’s true! And you are going to Portsmouth?”	360.3225528962394
“I have no time to lose. Tomorrow is the twenty-third, and Buckingham	476.638688375375
sets sail tomorrow with his fleet.”	455.91799922702194
“He sets sail tomorrow! Where for?”	331.15093183365275
“For La Rochelle.”	445.75187710072333
“He need not sail!” cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of	489.1302808013136
mind.	452.8306532560589
“Be satisfied,” replied Felton; “he will not sail.”	315.24845696717944
Milady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart of	358.71735099240055
this young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full	422.1218987040881
length.	485.5792095566087
“Felton,” cried she, “you are as great as Judas Maccabeus! If you die,	458.4667330449475
I will die with you; that is all I can say to you.”	403.4313436664965
“Silence!” cried Felton; “we are here.”	351.86671928384055
In fact, they touched the sloop.	330.7798325321855
Felton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the	354.94151245395454
sailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated.	422.0948306206046
An instant after they were on the deck.	408.0828763728993
“Captain,” said Felton, “this is the person of whom I spoke to you, and	429.2922212346044
whom you must convey safe and sound to France.”	431.85131352071966
“For a thousand pistoles,” said the captain.	296.71175002860514
“I have paid you five hundred of them.”	391.84551256333884
“That’s correct,” said the captain.	304.6490610092006
“And here are the other five hundred,” replied Milady, placing her hand	324.3862233899598
upon the bag of gold.	388.813458596547
“No,” said the captain, “I make but one bargain; and I have agreed with	320.7964941136113
this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till	376.49602206903506
we arrive at Boulogne.”	402.3372637150297
“And shall we arrive there?”	349.74470886027774
“Safe and sound, as true as my name’s Jack Butler.”	298.4699186606979
“Well,” said Milady, “if you keep your word, instead of five hundred, I	378.71214293885237
will give you a thousand pistoles.”	465.217136774817
“Hurrah for you, then, my beautiful lady,” cried the captain; “and may	452.63980100195045
God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship!”	329.14443711608624
“Meanwhile,” said Felton, “convey me to the little bay of—; you know it	479.89762539897697
was agreed you should put in there.”	416.8673619718666
The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers, and toward	297.6422414115386
seven o’clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay	351.54880898356146
that had been named.	481.0394917925587
During this passage, Felton related everything to Milady—how, instead	358.1603109947553
of going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had	433.85048051085465
returned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the	456.3182452292963
interstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and	377.3906841554316
how, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder. Milady knew	346.98043710744804
the rest.	440.44752485223876
On her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project; but at	334.9200249077459
the first words which issued from her mouth, she plainly saw that the	386.2899538247732
young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged.	294.8751731756086
It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten o’clock; if	471.68794683398403
he did not return by ten o’clock she was to sail.	434.21678842327907
In that case, and supposing he was at liberty, he was to rejoin her in	294.2854159897217
France, at the convent of the Carmelites at Béthune.	413.09868583579026
Chapter LIX.	433.01481314569645
WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH	446.69267655077533
AUGUST 23, 1628	475.2828492902225
Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk	303.4689735531152
takes leave of his sister, kissing her hand.	448.43950783143015
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness, only an	372.27257963197405
unusual fire beamed from his eyes, like the effects of a fever; his	414.60742662289687
brow was more pale than it generally was; his teeth were clenched, and	431.7288482004593
his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark	304.7202660282012
was at work within him.	317.49889364253545
As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land, he kept	434.23963961006143
his face toward Milady, who, standing on the deck, followed him with	457.3482370933915
her eyes. Both were free from the fear of pursuit; nobody ever came	443.4485064242763
into Milady’s apartment before nine o’clock, and it would require three	326.5904752170323
hours to go from the castle to London.	301.7104624304278
Felton jumped onshore, climbed the little ascent which led to the top	476.5931811981076
of the cliff, saluted Milady a last time, and took his course toward	442.44292683015783
the city.	474.81942097691325
At the end of a hundred paces, the ground began to decline, and he	429.80077829054983
could only see the mast of the sloop.	323.18824159087757
He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth, which he saw at	486.1011439739167
nearly half a league before him, standing out in the haze of the	440.63680761386195
morning, with its houses and towers.	312.4811497094056
Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a	451.14605913398
forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the	301.7127600777372
wind.	350.6518604338484
Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations	470.7209474510084
against the favorite of James I. and Charles I., furnished by two years	336.79591990028337
of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans.	434.10292710903036
When he compared the public crimes of this minister—startling crimes,	409.28694898483275
European crimes, if so we may say—with the private and unknown crimes	360.37955961865373
with which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable	426.0272659809856
of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of	476.7016943429513
whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so	329.9503544553586
strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and	455.97796541290177
imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying	454.1859601280084
glass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible	389.6565723818352
by the side of an ant.	351.3549317397708
The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he	329.96979530509384
left behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved,	382.76757997299654
or rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced,	430.31328490636804
present fatigue—all together exalted his mind above human feeling.	426.6912082578249
He entered Portsmouth about eight o’clock in the morning. The whole	412.2555176357418
population was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the	344.9006064884243
port; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.	387.6694322069029
Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty, covered with dust, and	418.42042091909957
streaming with perspiration. His countenance, usually so pale, was	418.7425877026034
purple with heat and passion. The sentinel wanted to repulse him; but	407.7976757111277
Felton called to the officer of the post, and drawing from his pocket	424.28719470896755
the letter of which he was the bearer, he said, “A pressing message	340.64633440089005
from Lord de Winter.”	376.6071475203767
At the name of Lord de Winter, who was known to be one of his Grace’s	386.92453736329117
most intimate friends, the officer of the post gave orders to let	392.6243400213004
Felton pass, who, besides, wore the uniform of a naval officer.	375.08535988726294
Felton darted into the palace.	392.49603442982425
At the moment he entered the vestibule, another man was entering	300.3012379184582
likewise, dusty, out of breath, leaving at the gate a post horse,	403.45599683287986
which, on reaching the palace, tumbled on his foreknees.	481.44550471798823
Felton and he addressed Patrick, the duke’s confidential lackey, at the	318.98571480316144
same moment. Felton named Lord de Winter; the unknown would not name	473.58872226660947
anybody, and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make	292.5829535618436
himself known. Each was anxious to gain admission before the other.	311.4351870153384
Patrick, who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service, and in	364.0853159165151
relations of friendship with the duke, gave the preference to the one	451.7759122062467
who came in his name. The other was forced to wait, and it was easily	482.9521298688394
to be seen how he cursed the delay.	474.8780790443204
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies	391.63592111630703
from La Rochelle, headed by the Prince de Soubise, and introduced him	343.5752415780431
into a closet where Buckingham, just out of the bath, was finishing his	337.96914379583995
toilet, upon which, as at all times, he bestowed extraordinary	391.7783067919222
attention.	369.38565320710575
“Lieutenant Felton, from Lord de Winter,” said Patrick.	374.773151742858
“From Lord de Winter!” repeated Buckingham; “let him come in.”	423.71159523558333
Felton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a	315.61503344915616
rich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet	427.30901914059314
doublet embroidered with pearls.	340.3922288748122
“Why didn’t the baron come himself?” demanded Buckingham. “I expected	419.21282072790643
him this morning.”	458.49806602376134
“He desired me to tell your Grace,” replied Felton, “that he very much	388.04563426759864
regretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard	426.14503644932574
he is obliged to keep at the castle.”	295.4220167966272
“Yes, I know that,” said Buckingham; “he has a prisoner.”	418.60778173875724
“It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace,” replied	382.9102141333841
Felton.	421.8238202112672
“Well, then, speak!”	484.5585609729846
“That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself, my	377.9562500354083
Lord!”	315.0155103051614
“Leave us, Patrick,” said Buckingham; “but remain within sound of the	407.157219286462
bell. I shall call you presently.”	415.7375346620904
Patrick went out.	481.25393023030864
“We are alone, sir,” said Buckingham; “speak!”	380.48677010266465
“My Lord,” said Felton, “the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day	437.45579491873104
to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young	462.01540688597237
woman named Charlotte Backson.”	425.5289234756278
“Yes, sir; and I answered him, to bring or send me that order and I	459.5126613153839
would sign it.”	476.33877320775656
“Here it is, my Lord.”	295.19998085477226
“Give it to me,” said the duke.	344.03595217758124
And taking it from Felton, he cast a rapid glance over the paper, and	443.940876373422
perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him, he	374.49387697155805
placed it on the table, took a pen, and prepared to sign it.	412.62980828816416
“Pardon, my Lord,” said Felton, stopping the duke; “but does your Grace	379.94127477754034
know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this	434.8149397676635
young woman?”	362.96336101435327
“Yes, sir, I know it,” replied the duke, dipping the quill in the ink.	353.3227138393731
“Then your Grace knows her real name?” asked Felton, in a sharp tone.	328.619992632145
“I know it”; and the duke put the quill to the paper. Felton grew pale.	484.9463220799963
“And knowing that real name, my Lord,” replied Felton, “will you sign	388.472794355871
it all the same?”	472.9720138933672
“Doubtless,” said Buckingham, “and rather twice than once.”	453.4490541769112
“I cannot believe,” continued Felton, in a voice that became more sharp	297.2820600745826
and rough, “that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this	481.4802335482693
relates.”	475.32186297418184
“I know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.”	430.23199250573634
“And will your Grace sign that order without remorse?”	330.5197215998271
Buckingham looked at the young man haughtily.	357.327430862258
“Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and	470.77086511884056
that I am very foolish to answer them?”	457.52236996806073
“Reply to them, my Lord,” said Felton; “the circumstances are more	384.9506587213876
serious than you perhaps believe.”	460.74491174228206
Buckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter,	317.75508308125495
undoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened.	425.8385448182106
“Without remorse,” said he. “The baron knows, as well as myself, that	312.1749807835035
Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very	462.6942271829989
favorably to commute her punishment to transportation.” The duke put	461.5762331505111
his pen to the paper.	477.79312423353946
“You will not sign that order, my Lord!” said Felton, making a step	356.3236159664505
toward the duke.	299.9601783693233
“I will not sign this order! And why not?”	480.65221874682254
“Because you will look into yourself, and you will do justice to the	462.13251743872684
lady.”	346.4336321589667
“I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn,” said Buckingham.	468.78767282279637
“This lady is infamous.”	351.0308507012967
“My Lord, Milady de Winter is an angel; you know that she is, and I	418.18060936710594
demand her liberty of you.”	362.71833576662084
“Bah! Are you mad, to talk to me thus?” said Buckingham.	367.26641845145116
“My Lord, excuse me! I speak as I can; I restrain myself. But, my Lord,	297.86211009448243
think of what you’re about to do, and beware of going too far!”	340.68049151564935
“What do you say? God pardon me!” cried Buckingham, “I really think he	338.64196310776276
threatens me!”	454.81054090435725
“No, my Lord, I still plead. And I say to you: one drop of water	428.1596352079637
suffices to make the full vase overflow; one slight fault may draw down	456.3557269964325
punishment upon the head spared, despite many crimes.”	343.195918416026
“Mr. Felton,” said Buckingham, “you will withdraw, and place yourself	441.8459377669816
at once under arrest.”	313.2366036357333
“You will hear me to the end, my Lord. You have seduced this young	450.301944976782
girl; you have outraged, defiled her. Repair your crimes toward her;	361.76411555251696
let her go free, and I will exact nothing else from you.”	390.714967087476
“You will exact!” said Buckingham, looking at Felton with astonishment,	344.3802081534936
and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced	459.0133783729393
them.	463.99235654357864
“My Lord,” continued Felton, becoming more excited as he spoke, “my	322.54335027060597
Lord, beware! All England is tired of your iniquities; my Lord, you	482.6419194172639
have abused the royal power, which you have almost usurped; my Lord,	302.6060643017787
you are held in horror by God and men. God will punish you hereafter,	317.75420948453257
but I will punish you here!”	476.18980358432344
“Ah, this is too much!” cried Buckingham, making a step toward the	309.57626168402294
door.	444.78348823668586
Felton barred his passage.	466.7188574651567
“I ask it humbly of you, my Lord,” said he; “sign the order for the	350.85706753454247
liberation of Milady de Winter. Remember that she is a woman whom you	464.7782018805
have dishonored.”	342.131161011552
“Withdraw, sir,” said Buckingham, “or I will call my attendant, and	441.8523914719488
have you placed in irons.”	380.9286928064916
“You shall not call,” said Felton, throwing himself between the duke	292.8494173674593
and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver. “Beware, my Lord,	432.90864484550605
you are in the hands of God!”	476.8387212435116
“In the hands of the devil, you mean!” cried Buckingham, raising his	445.83195335380117
voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely	346.5022414005225
shouting.	486.3470500221067
“Sign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,” said Felton,	417.4508815953586
holding out a paper to the duke.	318.0504062560084
“By force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!”	323.87696939156893
“Sign, my Lord!”	309.7548959466994
“Never.”	306.21244533878365
“Never?”	375.8735702472214
“Help!” shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his	490.30835659250556
sword.	438.7842964158469
But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with	456.3979526365725
which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he	374.0680524071786
was upon the duke.	435.4893381891693
At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, “A letter from France,	454.0418348683495
my Lord.”	435.034785363718
“From France!” cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from	474.010295162717
whom that letter came.	481.03323141908743
Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his	374.17649654899805
side up to the handle.	311.73179676110834
“Ah, traitor,” cried Buckingham, “you have killed me!”	345.05445898616654
“Murder!” screamed Patrick.	301.7648406994546
Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door	418.4271050725141
free, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said, the	385.53333806118303
deputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as	478.7974674498189
possible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he	424.7958827733537
met Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained	305.71855071340997
with blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat,	329.2390832946793
crying, “I knew it! I guessed it! But too late by a minute,	444.239474798273
unfortunate, unfortunate that I am!”	422.50214981664806
Felton made no resistance. Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of	447.0016291774499
the guards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little	422.33574336059445
terrace commanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the duke’s	452.94764193818276
chamber.	382.9977257894468
At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom	398.4258073911287
Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber.	343.7911475650364
He found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the	478.41946416785237
wound.	363.6093429751803
“Laporte,” said the duke, in a dying voice, “Laporte, do you come from	334.71046546639474
her?”	403.0736861436142
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of	491.97673467643773
Austria, “but too late, perhaps.”	324.0694200195048
“Silence, Laporte, you may be overheard. Patrick, let no one enter. Oh,	406.045165688129
I cannot tell what she says to me! My God, I am dying!”	401.880039976451
And the duke swooned.	343.26123825569266
Meanwhile, Lord de Winter, the deputies, the leaders of the expedition,	304.7475267603623
the officers of Buckingham’s household, had all made their way into the	353.1645635247045
chamber. Cries of despair resounded on all sides. The news, which	442.2480592743419
filled the palace with tears and groans, soon became known, and spread	311.26050715991727
itself throughout the city.	400.46967949470763
The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had	355.15988028605216
taken place.	292.410232197338
Lord de Winter tore his hair.	355.30473006981595
“Too late by a minute!” cried he, “too late by a minute! Oh, my God, my	430.43243458718024
God! what a misfortune!”	293.60937104133717
He had been informed at seven o’clock in the morning that a rope ladder	440.86828309465545
floated from one of the windows of the castle; he had hastened to	307.5159756591488
Milady’s chamber, had found it empty, the window open, and the bars	399.83616197890314
filed, had remembered the verbal caution D’Artagnan had transmitted to	359.5432359529711
him by his messenger, had trembled for the duke, and running to the	419.95770618097055
stable without taking time to have a horse saddled, had jumped upon the	383.74257077138213
first he found, had galloped off like the wind, had alighted below in	426.89456192414775
the courtyard, had ascended the stairs precipitately, and on the top	490.4116230559819
step, as we have said, had encountered Felton.	377.05065090381936
The duke, however, was not dead. He recovered a little, reopened his	369.7878180491953
eyes, and hope revived in all hearts.	483.8741881316268
“Gentlemen,” said he, “leave me alone with Patrick and Laporte—ah, is	395.8207483695047
that you, De Winter? You sent me a strange madman this morning! See the	467.9730567273919
state in which he has put me.”	345.13925316866835
“Oh, my Lord!” cried the baron, “I shall never console myself.”	467.97492138718053
“And you would be quite wrong, my dear De Winter,” said Buckingham,	422.6594711670424
holding out his hand to him. “I do not know the man who deserves being	436.4833654774633
regretted during the whole life of another man; but leave us, I pray	295.11984605626117
you.”	293.62690232528143
The baron went out sobbing.	370.8817747723531
There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and	399.93439846987735
Patrick. A physician was sought for, but none was yet found.	325.02799785809094
“You will live, my Lord, you will live!” repeated the faithful servant	341.5104523610661
of Anne of Austria, on his knees before the duke’s sofa.	484.5490177375489
“What has she written to me?” said Buckingham, feebly, streaming with	357.76849761667944
blood, and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved, “what has	469.458699639799
she written to me? Read me her letter.”	474.01171993360197
“Oh, my Lord!” said Laporte.	319.0991521343581
“Obey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?”	308.6951277513549
Laporte broke the seal, and placed the paper before the eyes of the	401.4688181268926
duke; but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing.	414.0080760232686
“Read!” said he, “read! I cannot see. Read, then! For soon, perhaps, I	357.7149113998911
shall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to	363.62711484624015
me.”	456.37932302483
Laporte made no further objection, and read:	323.53072522008245
“MY LORD, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you	436.98735544284324
and for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to	376.15327233866344
countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against	316.33177474095874
France, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is	294.6728590238206
the ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your	453.17844019216864
love for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great	349.99441562168283
catastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord,	381.01711729607274
for which I should never console myself.	412.6257764494709
    “Be careful of your life, which is menaced, and which will be dear	376.257491132921
    to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you.	412.5056768017207
“Your affectionate	374.69111210200043
“ANNE”	423.03517544192914
Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the	477.6640694088242
reading of the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a	425.04362756921876
bitter disappointment, he asked, “Have you nothing else to say to me by	372.92228791673347
the living voice, Laporte?”	414.12769955685064
“The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself, for she had	375.31482773473135
advice that your assassination would be attempted.”	470.45970572926956
“And is that all—is that all?” replied Buckingham, impatiently.	386.7223084394231
“She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you.”	454.32046073585224
“Ah,” said Buckingham, “God be praised! My death, then, will not be to	372.81231111042996
her as the death of a stranger!”	405.71207708248124
Laporte burst into tears.	324.63315003872344
“Patrick,” said the duke, “bring me the casket in which the diamond	371.40723166162786
studs were kept.”	439.05957786054853
Patrick brought the object desired, which Laporte recognized as having	343.7250187106612
belonged to the queen.	396.8158970506599
“Now the scent bag of white satin, on which her cipher is embroidered	435.1488456459675
in pearls.”	437.92487932514246
Patrick again obeyed.	344.7235839025032
“Here, Laporte,” said Buckingham, “these are the only tokens I ever	467.09146866938534
received from her—this silver casket and these two letters. You will	318.07692222739854
restore them to her Majesty; and as a last memorial”—he looked round	351.98775512463044
for some valuable object—“you will add—”	401.08828198555904
He still sought; but his eyes, darkened by death, encountered only the	458.61405475604033
knife which had fallen from the hand of Felton, still smoking with the	468.39751727832663
blood spread over its blade.	461.25773141376817
“And you will add to them this knife,” said the duke, pressing the hand	483.10015246211077
of Laporte. He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the	477.9015305550477
bottom of the silver casket, and to let the knife fall into it, making	428.6286226145111
a sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak; then, in a last	418.3720743137393
convulsion, which this time he had not the power to combat, he slipped	323.74043616865856
from the sofa to the floor.	300.0190595099151
Patrick uttered a loud cry.	442.2719054034184
Buckingham tried to smile a last time; but death checked his thought,	381.86553264578924
which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love.	384.52133135243025
At this moment the duke’s surgeon arrived, quite terrified; he was	356.65571726662074
already on board the admiral’s ship, where they had been obliged to	448.54193869994026
seek him.	475.7829402035194
He approached the duke, took his hand, held it for an instant in his	298.12738371837247
own, and letting it fall, “All is useless,” said he, “he is dead.”	345.41187490917804
“Dead, dead!” cried Patrick.	385.00216136019446
At this cry all the crowd re-entered the apartment, and throughout the	399.10008678041316
palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult.	341.85757567473985
As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead, he ran to Felton,	337.9801069764275
whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace.	443.7783431556411
“Wretch!” said he to the young man, who since the death of Buckingham	344.37804077756834
had regained that coolness and self-possession which never after	317.4493767978023
abandoned him, “wretch! what have you done?”	403.0826671735266
“I have avenged myself!” said he.	437.10562959941626
“Avenged yourself,” said the baron. “Rather say that you have served as	465.8314932155706
an instrument to that accursed woman; but I swear to you that this	422.8847104849293
crime shall be her last.”	404.16392189253423
“I don’t know what you mean,” replied Felton, quietly, “and I am	440.1838249293603
ignorant of whom you are speaking, my Lord. I killed the Duke of	361.3668733661534
Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain;	467.76747025031034
I have punished him for his injustice, that is all.”	335.4427150048647
De Winter, stupefied, looked on while the soldiers bound Felton, and	316.93920630811664
could not tell what to think of such insensibility.	422.75016822384555
One thing alone, however, threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton.	377.0485882557065
At every noise he heard, the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the	323.2921308799903
step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms, to	419.9323163699098
accuse herself, and die with him.	491.7777843316186
All at once he started. His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea,	473.1575082406069
commanded by the terrace where he was. With the eagle glance of a	466.2472725191411
sailor he had recognized there, where another would have seen only a	428.5818706705579
gull hovering over the waves, the sail of a sloop which was directed	466.6121129492336
toward the coast of France.	352.5261131370199
He grew deadly pale, placed his hand upon his heart, which was	446.73693732407173
breaking, and at once perceived all the treachery.	341.6380138764831
“One last favor, my Lord!” said he to the baron.	455.1184933741765
“What?” asked his Lordship.	482.2739686945132
“What o’clock is it?”	427.11315855905167
The baron drew out his watch. “It wants ten minutes to nine,” said he.	428.8852193626698
Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half. As soon as she	367.93645922718
heard the cannon which announced the fatal event, she had ordered the	311.88878475226056
anchor to be weighed. The vessel was making way under a blue sky, at	400.35620648545563
great distance from the coast.	463.3457804865729
“God has so willed it!” said he, with the resignation of a fanatic; but	384.8117069464574
without, however, being able to take his eyes from that ship, on board	446.95652348217953
of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of	404.8247646017318
her to whom he had sacrificed his life.	425.983245300848
De Winter followed his look, observed his feelings, and guessed all.	409.55009026144745
“Be punished _alone_, for the first, miserable man!” said Lord de	337.43622174120935
Winter to Felton, who was being dragged away with his eyes turned	363.0588424358042
toward the sea; “but I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I	448.4508237130334
have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved.”	384.0602873840879
Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable.	342.11098062786584
As to Lord de Winter, he descended the stairs rapidly, and went	415.52062113287076
straight to the port.	378.47416231178056
Chapter LX.	415.7090618704043
IN FRANCE	419.05206344414916
The first fear of the King of England, Charles I., on learning of the	319.42776347959625
death of the duke, was that such terrible news might discourage the	363.85298882647976
Rochellais; he tried, says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_, to conceal it	340.5285504325347
from them as long as possible, closing all the ports of his kingdom,	323.3661766286767
and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army	435.0969269510442
which Buckingham was getting together had gone, taking upon himself, in	350.21390450196947
default of Buckingham, to superintend the departure.	475.5469564481672
He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England	418.2295622794561
the ambassadors of Denmark, who had taken their leave, and the regular	314.73123611240777
ambassador of Holland, who was to take back to the port of Flushing the	350.60205997712507
Indian merchantmen of which Charles I. had made restitution to the	297.81673591798517
United Provinces.	334.10876109304746
But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the	370.87014394235314
event—that is to say, till two o’clock in the afternoon—two vessels had	441.45447510693197
already left the port, the one bearing, as we know, Milady, who,	353.79205803109824
already anticipating the event, was further confirmed in that belief by	422.45496745871446
seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral’s ship.	297.1173734515953
As to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and	356.927742110828
how it set sail.	385.18988426281044
During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only	315.0254088224083
the king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in	330.6120340083064
camp than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of	338.99304159858997
St. Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort	480.6073933678234
of only twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of	410.98125914048495
the king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his	486.53864052360484
royal lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of	295.1799409108554
September.	307.4656015994936
M. de Tréville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his	419.7450785582333
portmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire	482.00278839878206
and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris,	382.61048188591934
it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the	324.8506298155528
escort.	353.1198223905897
The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de	313.25651986917813
Tréville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it. It was	461.8138902379529
then that D’Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred	301.78753061394247
upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers—for without that	484.1075143669859
circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his	364.4046819751485
companions left it.	422.0515902443842
It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had	421.86424778512946
for a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the	305.32466297329773
convent of Béthune with Milady, her mortal enemy. Aramis therefore had	405.3218067104335
written immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had	429.4280150647178
such fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme.	477.71739885547436
Bonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or	377.74640324003366
Belgium. They had not long to wait for an answer. Eight or ten days	463.1996147921203
afterward Aramis received the following letter:	476.3109456357927
“MY DEAR COUSIN, Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw	360.96046110680686
our little servant from the convent of Béthune, the air of which you	437.4724721928667
think is bad for her. My sister sends you this authorization with great	409.3643128194302
pleasure, for she is very partial to the little girl, to whom she	387.5658345458308
intends to be more serviceable hereafter.	404.5138581681708
“I salute you,	467.0839284133018
“MARIE MICHON”	471.4648170275613
To this letter was added an order, conceived in these terms:	357.4628957523493
“At the Louvre, August 10, 1628	468.7993411333051
“The superior of the convent of Béthune will place in the hands of the	404.64944530586735
person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the	352.405032684324
convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage.	318.42149609601887
“ANNE”	314.0553032690859
It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a	413.5871378823466
seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but	435.5168590643516
Aramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his	475.38100709384764
eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos, begged his friends not to	395.47497286348886
revert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was	346.7951581909248
said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to	477.5988446382263
interfere in such affairs.	442.3552469173824
There was no further question, therefore, about Marie Michon among the	300.86716168991984
four Musketeers, who besides had what they wanted: that was, the order	357.902660281496
to withdraw Mme. Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of	408.5136240500183
Béthune. It was true that this order would not be of great use to them	415.0629870063324
while they were in camp at La Rochelle; that is to say, at the other	451.1639018570121
end of France. Therefore D’Artagnan was going to ask leave of absence	348.56443477685076
of M. de Tréville, confiding to him candidly the importance of his	361.5998384114289
departure, when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three	406.3144431913248
friends that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of	481.6029527351317
twenty Musketeers, and that they formed part of the escort.	463.0699059746935
Their joy was great. The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage,	405.5679083732244
and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth.	330.08452281933984
The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgères to Mauzes; and there	407.945313218541
the king and his minister took leave of each other with great	465.51041497434477
demonstrations of friendship.	382.51705130622815
The king, however, who sought distraction, while traveling as fast as	443.8256057989189
possible—for he was anxious to be in Paris by the twenty-third—stopped	454.9534799993316
from time to time to fly the magpie, a pastime for which the taste had	423.74903087329045
been formerly inspired in him by de Luynes, and for which he had always	365.5052149843821
preserved a great predilection. Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen,	458.6657470883399
when this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the	452.22332043480674
other four cursed it heartily. D’Artagnan, in particular, had a	379.9204709652338
perpetual buzzing in his ears, which Porthos explained thus: “A very	303.7409780891952
great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you	352.4863292886878
somewhere.”	330.3301032577698
At length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third, in the	303.9480411614273
night. The king thanked M. de Tréville, and permitted him to distribute	444.1033132807828
furloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should	397.2377875537013
not appear in any public place, under penalty of the Bastille.	298.9127704825975
The first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four	488.99957306498834
friends. Still further, Athos obtained of M. de Tréville six days	433.99097781757166
instead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights—for	436.99478653284325
they set out on the twenty-fourth at five o’clock in the evening, and	415.5871378269534
as a further kindness M. de Tréville post-dated the leave to the	417.77262300787635
morning of the twenty-fifth.	433.712110232084
“Good Lord!” said D’Artagnan, who, as we have often said, never	425.2951543536147
stumbled at anything. “It appears to me that we are making a great	449.6989567234011
trouble of a very simple thing. In two days, and by using up two or	489.6656792699753
three horses (that’s nothing; I have plenty of money), I am at Béthune.	367.94315144701125
I present my letter from the queen to the superior, and I bring back	471.83501510131873
the dear treasure I go to seek—not into Lorraine, not into Belgium, but	310.02068346062435
to Paris, where she will be much better concealed, particularly while	446.4192109528458
the cardinal is at La Rochelle. Well, once returned from the country,	488.5863454698632
half by the protection of her cousin, half through what we have	420.8230924466353
personally done for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire.	296.1481484900394
Remain, then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless	332.05691215519977
fatigue. Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition	386.7750714493897
requires.”	407.6176730177793
To this Athos replied quietly: “We also have money left—for I have not	362.5230502439865
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and Porthos and Aramis have not	348.05169164751584
eaten all theirs. We can therefore use up four horses as well as one.	470.92275041197615
But consider, D’Artagnan,” added he, in a tone so solemn that it made	386.17896298906203
the young man shudder, “consider that Béthune is a city where the	374.17537373303696
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings	408.18662210449986
misery with her. If you had only to deal with four men, D’Artagnan, I	404.65553048812586
would allow you to go alone. You have to do with that woman! We four	433.6551240389149
will go; and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in	430.20172891436073
sufficient number.”	404.4790211184522
“You terrify me, Athos!” cried D’Artagnan. “My God! what do you fear?”	487.85982869094744
“Everything!” replied Athos.	396.2718338663992
D’Artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like	338.8837065389227
that of Athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued	488.4655199799088
their route as fast as their horses could carry them, but without	294.4595722049035
adding another word.	465.26905491371775
On the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering Arras, and as	348.2662454996332
D’Artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a	377.54383527966377
glass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just	384.1114377051659
had a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the	433.4112308487587
road to Paris. At the moment he passed through the gateway into the	435.1173711473881
street, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although	471.51901527186135
it was in the month of August, and lifted his hat, which the traveler	445.031429333035
seized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it	346.6964600549077
eagerly over his eyes.	301.2008877531646
D’Artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and	393.99726344347425
let his glass fall.	298.318623403009
“What is the matter, monsieur?” said Planchet. “Oh, come, gentlemen, my	418.26700111261744
master is ill!”	366.08747946803095
The three friends hastened toward D’Artagnan, who, instead of being	348.5350895156734
ill, ran toward his horse. They stopped him at the door.	320.7582345842537
“Well, where the devil are you going now?” cried Athos.	397.3371040528343
“It is he!” cried D’Artagnan, pale with anger, and with the sweat on	480.2841816550014
his brow, “it is he! let me overtake him!”	345.16953035094525
“He? What he?” asked Athos.	379.5214434680778
“He, that man!”	317.22869604615727
“What man?”	342.8326074725066
“That cursed man, my evil genius, whom I have always met with when	455.6769290308631
threatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman	474.613669339421
when I met her for the first time, he whom I was seeking when I	484.45641060135813
offended our Athos, he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux	419.0038822437085
was abducted. I have seen him; that is he! I recognized him when the	469.7372092381155
wind blew upon his cloak.”	491.184359049889
“The devil!” said Athos, musingly.	347.3748278713536
“To saddle, gentlemen! to saddle! Let us pursue him, and we shall	449.63596125143613
overtake him!”	336.02052412054553
“My dear friend,” said Aramis, “remember that he goes in an opposite	304.30965425592257
direction from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse,	454.8630267698444
and ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without	438.4724562548911
even a chance of overtaking him. Let the man go, D’Artagnan; let us	357.0435178004062
save the woman.”	309.07309296027967
“Monsieur, monsieur!” cried a hostler, running out and looking after	391.755729499135
the stranger, “monsieur, here is a paper which dropped out of your hat!	416.99173929869914
Eh, monsieur, eh!”	337.03574453017086
“Friend,” said D’Artagnan, “a half-pistole for that paper!”	447.97850075081766
“My faith, monsieur, with great pleasure! Here it is!”	337.93549015019806
The hostler, enchanted with the good day’s work he had done, returned	335.6067806583368
to the yard. D’Artagnan unfolded the paper.	487.0011406528695
“Well?” eagerly demanded all his three friends.	337.4540048279639
“Nothing but one word!” said D’Artagnan.	374.4864011926899
“Yes,” said Aramis, “but that one word is the name of some town or	394.63953084057243
village.”	378.82592607481905
“_Armentières_,” read Porthos; “Armentières? I don’t know such a	440.0738165401424
place.”	327.74635954417977
“And that name of a town or village is written in her hand!” cried	459.05718612021866
Athos.	378.16768954091117
“Come on, come on!” said D’Artagnan; “let us keep that paper carefully,	445.88263650243823
perhaps I have not thrown away my half-pistole. To horse, my friends,	364.30316395407243
to horse!”	395.84753080347355
And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Béthune.	302.7209391768879
Chapter LXI.	428.85504803532876
THE CARMELITE CONVENT AT BÉTHUNE	427.17724430995565
Great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes	354.61712081376334
them surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to	461.1942736006148
the moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their	301.73201914267753
impious fortunes.	477.88390618582264
It was thus with Milady. She escaped the cruisers of both nations, and	429.4818123472603
arrived at Boulogne without accident.	295.2096821844621
When landing at Portsmouth, Milady was an Englishwoman whom the	429.4145221032978
persecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle; when landing at	463.89013070121234
Boulogne, after a two days’ passage, she passed for a Frenchwoman whom	339.91804076220177
the English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France.	417.24999614479975
Milady had, likewise, the best of passports—her beauty, her noble	310.5844296816479
appearance, and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles.	359.84094073265254
Freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant	479.51376676117434
manners of an old governor of the port, who kissed her hand, she only	374.19958948707676
remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter,	436.0329613856506
conceived in the following terms:	385.9802284215557
“_To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu, in his camp	365.9112240524925
before La Rochelle_.	457.2502114777002
“MONSEIGNEUR, Let your Eminence be reassured. His Grace the Duke of	294.05464592240645
Buckingham _will not set out_ for France.	359.8100140761417
“MILADY DE ——	410.76440360552704
“BOULOGNE, evening of the twenty-fifth.	470.9226872623326
“P.S.—According to the desire of your Eminence, I report to the convent	303.22583639386914
of the Carmelites at Béthune, where I will await your orders.”	323.838682431153
Accordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey. Night	418.64620170802283
overtook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn. At five o’clock the	461.3463549707434
next morning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered	339.32526993403934
Béthune. She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites, and went	408.86079228631274
thither immediately.	360.89157837054495
The superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinal’s order. The	448.2225505297633
abbess assigned her a chamber, and had breakfast served.	374.19538814901057
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks,	482.83672774480846
fixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for	364.993246852529
her by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his	481.653605120172
name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair. The ever-new	462.3132208682713
passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those	305.7773410772736
clouds which float in the heavens, reflecting sometimes azure,	299.5404540031726
sometimes fire, sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest, and	455.48056495135404
which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and	461.55427962071803
death.	401.5587505937012
After breakfast, the abbess came to pay her a visit. There is very	371.189488719515
little amusement in the cloister, and the good superior was eager to	365.161971641638
make the acquaintance of her new boarder.	350.134769138872
Milady wished to please the abbess. This was a very easy matter for a	298.6019225974526
woman so really superior as she was. She tried to be agreeable, and she	447.31859613457107
was charming, winning the good superior by her varied conversation and	374.1326146840447
by the graces of her whole personality.	447.93212594926206
The abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular	472.7209289857856
delight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the	484.8498252657495
extremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much	431.52524530608474
difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the	349.49305104519203
noise of the world dies away.	429.3992250958731
Milady, on the contrary, was quite conversant with all aristocratic	355.3301914978355
intrigues, amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years.	338.9829894797165
She made it her business, therefore, to amuse the good abbess with the	401.28059475617613
worldly practices of the court of France, mixed with the eccentric	470.6596420300059
pursuits of the king; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the	376.94393229884184
lords and ladies of the court, whom the abbess knew perfectly by name,	458.45387945647286
touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham,	377.68664948484025
talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little.	338.3048908357307
But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without	338.51393550934745
replying a word. Milady, however, saw that this sort of narrative	486.514895509335
amused her very much, and kept at it; only she now let her conversation	333.66287043410983
drift toward the cardinal.	296.00392864753866
But she was greatly embarrassed. She did not know whether the abbess	319.5702710891501
was a royalist or a cardinalist; she therefore confined herself to a	411.8637845644144
prudent middle course. But the abbess, on her part, maintained a	309.8845414914202
reserve still more prudent, contenting herself with making a profound	438.05520024127486
inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the	399.3322659430291
name of his Eminence.	355.27694911428506
Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life; she	456.7662517308336
resolved, then, to risk something in order that she might know how to	301.5433794968068
act afterward. Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good	320.4968059698631
abbess would go, she began to tell a story, obscure at first, but very	427.012775684874
circumstantial afterward, about the cardinal, relating the amours of	410.34725956365213
the minister with Mme. d’Aiguillon, Marion de Lorme, and several other	488.5535194144783
gay women.	447.206116902963
The abbess listened more attentively, grew animated by degrees, and	340.1678967628485
smiled.	472.31593291193167
“Good,” thought Milady; “she takes a pleasure in my conversation. If	338.29657187123667
she is a cardinalist, she has no fanaticism, at least.”	381.5469460452602
She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal	308.8416679934272
upon his enemies. The abbess only crossed herself, without approving or	400.41189473314387
disapproving.	454.0128117307871
This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather	367.948162891223
royalist than cardinalist. Milady therefore continued, coloring her	428.0875116757402
narrations more and more.	474.3471637364888
“I am very ignorant of these matters,” said the abbess, at length; “but	313.87256977305935
however distant from the court we may be, however remote from the	430.7303313080491
interests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of	483.8819478307473
what you have related. And one of our boarders has suffered much from	336.39916607087133
the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal!”	394.00473152998995
“One of your boarders?” said Milady; “oh, my God! Poor woman! I pity	348.0265852347785
her, then.”	461.3857705642912
“And you have reason, for she is much to be pitied. Imprisonment,	341.60683594654046
menaces, ill treatment—she has suffered everything. But after all,”	390.2685325278541
resumed the abbess, “Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives	305.0299616368807
for acting thus; and though she has the look of an angel, we must not	393.24138381124817
always judge people by the appearance.”	428.1136019285528
“Good!” said Milady to herself; “who knows! I am about, perhaps, to	356.52442960773976
discover something here; I am in the vein.”	372.74984395764125
She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor.	420.3726173630557
“Alas,” said Milady, “I know it is so. It is said that we must not	404.00933025424627
trust to the face; but in what, then, shall we place confidence, if not	378.95838957583646
in the most beautiful work of the Lord? As for me, I shall be deceived	382.9668251119518
all my life perhaps, but I shall always have faith in a person whose	412.2581223194024
countenance inspires me with sympathy.”	412.30944529891315
“You would, then, be tempted to believe,” said the abbess, “that this	436.4194176683709
young person is innocent?”	456.8962586870334
“The cardinal pursues not only crimes,” said she: “there are certain	338.4021254492866
virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses.”	450.0826645637935
“Permit me, madame, to express my surprise,” said the abbess.	437.34958081531795
“At what?” said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness.	432.5896048692781
“At the language you use.”	441.39076494229073
“What do you find so astonishing in that language?” said Milady,	376.6205001313102
smiling.	442.47998360389875
“You are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet—”	468.14751487051313
“And yet I speak ill of him,” replied Milady, finishing the thought of	451.64595606442333
the superior.	402.537436076572
“At least you don’t speak well of him.”	489.0865746231824
“That is because I am not his friend,” said she, sighing, “but his	296.68981842417924
victim!”	458.9672274485267
“But this letter in which he recommends you to me?”	359.19343660857476
“Is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which	470.52647842494923
he will release me by one of his satellites.”	347.8057691297634
“But why have you not fled?”	456.2888200090566
“Whither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which	446.14324839767335
the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his	326.716214584302
hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a	432.80880336639586
woman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?”	343.28464106527804
“No, that is true; but she—that is another thing; I believe she is	330.74668492255796
detained in France by some love affair.”	313.9271498072008
“Ah,” said Milady, with a sigh, “if she loves she is not altogether	380.3555766115436
wretched.”	472.1418774306345
“Then,” said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, “I	355.0411085313593
behold another poor victim?”	425.109791223784
“Alas, yes,” said Milady.	462.7587780231212
The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh	356.8728701576719
thought suggested itself to her mind.	384.2105329772803
“You are not an enemy of our holy faith?” said she, hesitatingly.	385.4952414352087
“Who—I?” cried Milady; “I a Protestant? Oh, no! I call to witness the	327.6734968017616
God who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!”	403.5133781723794
“Then, madame,” said the abbess, smiling, “be reassured; the house in	377.8673271584521
which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in	302.7571901661747
our power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here,	384.8902472577
moreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt,	453.0809203325381
in consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and	480.8772569666738
well-behaved.”	351.7459692068093
“What is her name?”	450.01910091490385
“She was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I	426.0751352275505
have not tried to discover her other name.”	423.5605298932235
“Kitty!” cried Milady. “What? Are you sure?”	305.70496656189704
“That she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?”	346.16140005573345
Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that	389.6392293910689
this might be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the	366.2879363061558
remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of	443.6460351220612
vengeance disordered the features of Milady, which, however,	402.43532997416827
immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this	358.78007879182474
woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose.	294.32711339658164
“And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a	354.8075966271011
sympathy?” asked Milady.	394.9437019652776
“Why, this evening,” said the abbess; “today even. But you have been	396.1139102004238
traveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you	422.3181076874241
rose at five o’clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and	316.4257609051548
sleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.”	380.2957321980831
Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained	349.22082560290727
as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her	342.675054281431
heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the	412.48505071428707
offer of the superior. During the last fifteen days she had experienced	399.83649832129964
so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still	359.0754562190717
capable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.	310.15278796700284
She therefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked	296.20901578191433
by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought	300.1725365827359
to her thoughts. She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the	449.33559788795736
cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. She had	378.29506545084195
succeeded; D’Artagnan was then in her power!	365.0922380770669
One thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her	354.6091282034345
husband, the Comte de la Fère, whom she had believed dead, or at least	344.0243593397634
expatriated, and whom she found again in Athos—the best friend of	399.02574500851375
D’Artagnan.	322.00811653164055
But alas, if he was the friend of D’Artagnan, he must have lent him his	375.52274174397223
assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated	384.81963441168057
the project of his Eminence; if he was the friend of D’Artagnan, he was	345.4838792030729
the enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving	395.4742249587516
him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer.	326.32098540638765
All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady; so, rocked by	403.3732675180145
them, she soon fell asleep.	376.0479216195644
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed.	320.1682121060051
She opened her eyes, and saw the abbess, accompanied by a young woman	491.6582114687526
with light hair and delicate complexion, who fixed upon her a look full	463.77827156916226
of benevolent curiosity.	410.0616850691024
The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her. Each examined	390.2917573010053
the other with great attention, while exchanging the customary	379.2301090302222
compliments; both were very handsome, but of quite different styles of	386.00082127010563
beauty. Milady, however, smiled in observing that she excelled the	440.8784571831291
young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing. It is true	402.59315602277945
that the habit of a novice, which the young woman wore, was not very	345.02373517304284
advantageous in a contest of this kind.	361.8953987147685
The abbess introduced them to each other. When this formality was	447.26757645853763
ended, as her duties called her to chapel, she left the two young women	360.6654433251066
alone.	375.1744238212124
The novice, seeing Milady in bed, was about to follow the example of	398.15095291522874
the superior; but Milady stopped her.	385.9480822453927
“How, madame,” said she, “I have scarcely seen you, and you already	335.2243612779335
wish to deprive me of your company, upon which I had counted a little,	460.5902362232457
I must confess, for the time I have to pass here?”	340.07453588845533
“No, madame,” replied the novice, “only I thought I had chosen my time	326.8307477742154
ill; you were asleep, you are fatigued.”	381.2088185524144
“Well,” said Milady, “what can those who sleep wish for—a happy	439.6802310647578
awakening? This awakening you have given me; allow me, then, to enjoy	472.8468476477152
it at my ease,” and taking her hand, she drew her toward the armchair	346.9442940988008
by the bedside.	357.1571847808507
The novice sat down.	317.2132664499667
“How unfortunate I am!” said she; “I have been here six months without	437.87068355654117
the shadow of recreation. You arrive, and your presence was likely to	391.9902608419455
afford me delightful company; yet I expect, in all probability, to quit	333.75634999564573
the convent at any moment.”	362.76714709597314
“How, you are going soon?” asked Milady.	458.37327548747646
“At least I hope so,” said the novice, with an expression of joy which	422.1113077995303
she made no effort to disguise.	385.8649831112297
“I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal,”	473.7626535936426
continued Milady; “that would have been another motive for sympathy	312.76222192584714
between us.”	324.55983060984863
“What I have heard, then, from our good mother is true; you have	435.2696393229742
likewise been a victim of that wicked priest.”	409.28814164604694
“Hush!” said Milady; “let us not, even here, speak thus of him. All my	483.32335221562255
misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before	312.9357723369701
a woman whom I thought my friend, and who betrayed me. Are you also the	316.0121463679192
victim of a treachery?”	357.14100391317083
“No,” said the novice, “but of my devotion—of a devotion to a woman I	396.96934161455715
loved, for whom I would have laid down my life, for whom I would give	463.265013289906
it still.”	417.005682847886
“And who has abandoned you—is that it?”	399.98290886789715
“I have been sufficiently unjust to believe so; but during the last two	402.1422879047917
or three days I have obtained proof to the contrary, for which I thank	351.38728315195794
God—for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me.	424.98032658208933
But you, madame, you appear to be free,” continued the novice; “and if	329.1395689153601
you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so.”	425.85399901299377
“Whither would you have me go, without friends, without money, in a	295.66632486681505
part of France with which I am unacquainted, and where I have never	344.67290167532445
been before?”	433.8737696352747
“Oh,” cried the novice, “as to friends, you would have them wherever	375.53073782436496
you want, you appear so good and are so beautiful!”	471.58170513200963
“That does not prevent,” replied Milady, softening her smile so as to	395.9618749196215
give it an angelic expression, “my being alone or being persecuted.”	337.2498357182622
“Hear me,” said the novice; “we must trust in heaven. There always	398.31577626229677
comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before	317.5255798419072
God; and see, perhaps it is a happiness for you, humble and powerless	304.8103407331963
as I am, that you have met with me, for if I leave this place, well—I	487.11744041916313
have powerful friends, who, after having exerted themselves on my	431.8980725934951
account, may also exert themselves for you.”	441.5659755501355
“Oh, when I said I was alone,” said Milady, hoping to make the novice	433.6978123507832
talk by talking of herself, “it is not for want of friends in high	327.0000606327384
places; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal. The	437.5385715892314
queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister. I have	389.6552959069245
proof that her Majesty, notwithstanding her excellent heart, has more	451.5338639138073
than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons	468.43036262885573
who had served her.”	364.75558988810485
“Trust me, madame; the queen may appear to have abandoned those	421.5733873206755
persons, but we must not put faith in appearances. The more they are	478.9586984862776
persecuted, the more she thinks of them; and often, when they least	387.61661158624497
expect it, they have proof of a kind remembrance.”	415.4906608806154
“Alas!” said Milady, “I believe so; the queen is so good!”	393.3601723007063
“Oh, you know her, then, that lovely and noble queen, that you speak of	395.06321240789816
her thus!” cried the novice, with enthusiasm.	320.9239235154609
“That is to say,” replied Milady, driven into her entrenchment, “that I	337.93887470822085
have not the honor of knowing her personally; but I know a great number	438.56248336603767
of her most intimate friends. I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange;	469.6461250491911
I met Monsieur Dujart in England; I know Monsieur de Tréville.”	490.9962809261603
“Monsieur de Tréville!” exclaimed the novice, “do you know Monsieur de	404.3812265843503
Tréville?”	381.941225162381
“Yes, perfectly well—intimately even.”	369.47714203422413
“The captain of the king’s Musketeers?”	349.784409784989
“The captain of the king’s Musketeers.”	465.3862118734572
“Why, then, only see!” cried the novice; “we shall soon be well	470.1616444531338
acquainted, almost friends. If you know Monsieur de Tréville, you must	485.7085250724785
have visited him?”	483.9241912983689
“Often!” said Milady, who, having entered this track, and perceiving	450.8673629408722
that falsehood succeeded, was determined to follow it to the end.	293.3583684328523
“With him, then, you must have seen some of his Musketeers?”	394.926252049788
“All those he is in the habit of receiving!” replied Milady, for whom	411.6448272067209
this conversation began to have a real interest.	480.8037435033892
“Name a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my	355.69146774988684
friends.”	453.5390730084225
“Well!” said Milady, embarrassed, “I know Monsieur de Louvigny,	421.24176365707365
Monsieur de Courtivron, Monsieur de Ferussac.”	325.68764927685027
The novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, “Don’t	444.57337950083627
you know a gentleman named Athos?”	311.34805019250797
Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and	411.33209847704495
mistress as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing	427.5764835904615
the hand of the novice, and devouring her with looks.	404.547933322034
“What is the matter? Good God!” asked the poor woman, “have I said	329.367840585641
anything that has wounded you?”	433.757768600305
“No; but the name struck me, because I also have known that gentleman,	488.5463577049467
and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know	425.67804379672606
him well.”	354.4466166634879
“Oh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, Messieurs	382.32233363547874
Porthos and Aramis!”	304.83748558508506
“Indeed! you know them likewise? I know them,” cried Milady, who began	327.3633300981681
to feel a chill penetrate her heart.	400.3365950244368
“Well, if you know them, you know that they are good and free	439.2861270892247
companions. Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of	340.7616038589707
help?”	310.58720011181873
“That is to say,” stammered Milady, “I am not really very intimate with	442.893597810858
any of them. I know them from having heard one of their friends,	442.3283124284151
Monsieur d’Artagnan, say a great deal about them.”	408.3869425558978
“You know Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried the novice, in her turn seizing	480.5773465006265
the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes.	344.9384197798583
Then remarking the strange expression of Milady’s countenance, she	435.7853863966293
said, “Pardon me, madame; you know him by what title?”	423.6959196594488
“Why,” replied Milady, embarrassed, “why, by the title of friend.”	417.0465816562147
“You deceive me, madame,” said the novice; “you have been his	340.9502615081638
mistress!”	360.88728107040464
“It is you who have been his mistress, madame!” cried Milady, in her	393.0549036733797
turn.	338.52018381887217
“I?” said the novice.	330.87821357664944
“Yes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!”	405.80530381602307
The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror.	449.7875957581972
“Oh, do not deny it! Answer!” continued Milady.	302.47990651271886
“Well, yes, madame,” said the novice, “Are we rivals?”	326.5243491843558
The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under	446.0387205525247
any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but	329.4100603789041
she was absorbed by jealousy.	298.6165220244404
“Speak, madame!” resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she	487.84611567700597
might not have been believed capable. “Have you been, or are you, his	376.11004686922047
mistress?”	294.81516871327005
“Oh, no!” cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her	312.46020877705223
truth. “Never, never!”	413.09092429843884
“I believe you,” said Mme. Bonacieux; “but why, then, did you cry out	440.07360181339817
so?”	355.1131617483226
“Do you not understand?” said Milady, who had already overcome her	372.85171052692317
agitation and recovered all her presence of mind.	457.03891071766975
“How can I understand? I know nothing.”	315.5510985354339
“Can you not understand that Monsieur d’Artagnan, being my friend,	374.19979483219964
might take me into his confidence?”	320.788301056216
“Truly?”	297.97705813327
“Do you not perceive that I know all—your abduction from the little	317.10239421671054
house at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their	296.5973692034515
useless inquiries up to this moment? How could I help being astonished	357.2974486391142
when, without having the least expectation of such a thing, I meet you	364.88044186720515
face to face—you, of whom we have so often spoken together, you whom he	402.7292082768307
loves with all his soul, you whom he had taught me to love before I had	462.9122682145501
seen you! Ah, dear Constance, I have found you, then; I see you at	383.48108248129705
last!”	445.25117069506246
And Milady stretched out her arms to Mme. Bonacieux, who, convinced by	427.60810655402815
what she had just said, saw nothing in this woman whom an instant	397.3586568526249
before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend.	392.19665943003145
“Oh, pardon me, pardon me!” cried she, sinking upon the shoulders of	376.30484465643207
Milady. “Pardon me, I love him so much!”	475.58805842520206
These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace.	334.3702203150133
Certainly, if Milady’s strength had been equal to her hatred, Mme.	480.90516455005434
Bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive. But not being able	326.3012997581807
to stifle her, she smiled upon her.	401.96347714162545
“Oh, you beautiful, good little creature!” said Milady. “How delighted	489.5922222237085
I am to have found you! Let me look at you!” and while saying these	425.51872603015005
words, she absolutely devoured her by her looks. “Oh, yes it is you	457.57390617607587
indeed! From what he has told me, I know you now. I recognize you	479.0889587812419
perfectly.”	331.85700108962504
The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty	475.60723125632893
was behind the rampart of that pure brow, behind those brilliant eyes	324.9706755045329
in which she read nothing but interest and compassion.	409.4491865229983
“Then you know what I have suffered,” said Mme. Bonacieux, “since he	445.59007892669507
has told you what he has suffered; but to suffer for him is happiness.”	416.9767522324013
Milady replied mechanically, “Yes, that is happiness.” She was thinking	428.17035163928
of something else.	381.5586564621834
“And then,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “my punishment is drawing to a	455.6599526079301
close. Tomorrow, this evening, perhaps, I shall see him again; and then	408.7543678561823
the past will no longer exist.”	315.47725218606877
“This evening?” asked Milady, roused from her reverie by these words.	408.82274703063877
“What do you mean? Do you expect news from him?”	322.7223069771802
“I expect himself.”	443.97597779241227
“Himself? D’Artagnan here?”	377.14435720121577
“Himself!”	477.41667239981007
“But that’s impossible! He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the	452.7468001160914
cardinal. He will not return till after the taking of the city.”	296.1001196203887
“Ah, you fancy so! But is there anything impossible for my D’Artagnan,	374.28065806781274
the noble and loyal gentleman?”	474.460349271283
“Oh, I cannot believe you!”	433.78231348947634
“Well, read, then!” said the unhappy young woman, in the excess of her	367.9095795107168
pride and joy, presenting a letter to Milady.	420.4254904870454
“The writing of Madame de Chevreuse!” said Milady to herself. “Ah, I	348.374804303955
always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter!”	327.5339006022036
And she greedily read the following few lines:	399.6362143691062
MY DEAR CHILD, Hold yourself ready. _Our friend_ will see you soon, and	307.57674543039764
he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which	444.3123715322696
your safety required you should be concealed. Prepare, then, for your	420.2851627784818
departure, and never despair of us.	402.68609128052145
    Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful	299.3900527518277
    as ever. Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning	346.3806896109538
    he has given.	395.10929330685286
“Yes, yes,” said Milady; “the letter is precise. Do you know what that	442.2566259027561
warning was?”	362.3825191768521
“No, I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh	484.92259233706267
machinations of the cardinal.”	360.21292761788067
“Yes, that’s it, no doubt!” said Milady, returning the letter to Mme.	486.3458719734493
Bonacieux, and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom.	343.93389678762867
At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse.	487.4763376550481
“Oh!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, darting to the window, “can it be he?”	326.7944548009097
Milady remained still in bed, petrified by surprise; so many unexpected	416.5228136270337
things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a	355.77070680159164
loss.	428.9870657882457
“He, he!” murmured she; “can it be he?” And she remained in bed with	314.7795554168626
her eyes fixed.	296.55428242588386
“Alas, no!” said Mme. Bonacieux; “it is a man I don’t know, although he	471.05499705214936
seems to be coming here. Yes, he checks his pace; he stops at the gate;	480.87338562340943
he rings.”	384.9417309814056
Milady sprang out of bed.	319.1283461985577
“You are sure it is not he?” said she.	407.8685600632291
“Yes, yes, very sure!”	333.4035714944253
“Perhaps you did not see well.”	339.1002999531406
“Oh, if I were to see the plume of his hat, the end of his cloak, I	304.93204414706764
should know _him!_”	469.1469909011569
Milady was dressing herself all the time.	414.2673473627116
“Yes, he has entered.”	475.68039480692
“It is for you or me!”	486.86867848486656
“My God, how agitated you seem!”	451.04984409564497
“Yes, I admit it. I have not your confidence; I fear the cardinal.”	467.6847990578722
“Hush!” said Mme. Bonacieux; “somebody is coming.”	349.1033559699258
Immediately the door opened, and the superior entered.	460.894178628371
“Did you come from Boulogne?” demanded she of Milady.	473.0769251266557
“Yes,” replied she, trying to recover her self-possession. “Who wants	354.5378625730176
me?”	310.487696294226
“A man who will not tell his name, but who comes from the cardinal.”	325.3442233983483
“And who wishes to speak with me?”	378.7092993367012
“Who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne.”	408.22820205484106
“Then let him come in, if you please.”	293.15500610319145
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Mme. Bonacieux. “Can it be bad news?”	313.48861699493676
“I fear it.”	359.3115334917007
“I will leave you with this stranger; but as soon as he is gone, if you	321.69232190130805
will permit me, I will return.”	428.0525966032659
“_Permit_ you? I _beseech_ you.”	489.20017855438005
The superior and Mme. Bonacieux retired.	349.1671502868236
Milady remained alone, with her eyes fixed upon the door. An instant	306.04962734435986
later, the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs, steps drew	393.9895166541637
near, the door opened, and a man appeared.	358.6901901088345
Milady uttered a cry of joy; this man was the Comte de Rochefort—the	311.14937198577735
demoniacal tool of his Eminence.	405.5940212066462
Chapter LXII.	352.2059288838182
TWO VARIETIES OF DEMONS	468.51362334607626
Ah,” cried Milady and Rochefort together, “it is you!”	362.2569338901216
“Yes, it is I.”	377.16797778836326
“And you come?” asked Milady.	304.649751651703
“From La Rochelle; and you?”	351.22728004043154
“From England.”	404.8569646056237
“Buckingham?”	324.987172905119
“Dead or desperately wounded, as I left without having been able to	386.19711674527593
hear anything of him. A fanatic has just assassinated him.”	386.24679538941615
“Ah,” said Rochefort, with a smile; “this is a fortunate chance—one	358.97625077237024
that will delight his Eminence! Have you informed him of it?”	302.1997622746173
“I wrote to him from Boulogne. But what brings you here?”	358.7332834499148
“His Eminence was uneasy, and sent me to find you.”	298.36886196094014
“I only arrived yesterday.”	340.3340326041788
“And what have you been doing since yesterday?”	393.80898694572403
“I have not lost my time.”	436.4386796256116
“Oh, I don’t doubt that.”	335.10441771930044
“Do you know whom I have encountered here?”	393.1574703033598
“No.”	488.52548785589795
“Guess.”	391.3436518959993
“How can I?”	425.7179924392361
“That young woman whom the queen took out of prison.”	444.5184404126645
“The mistress of that fellow D’Artagnan?”	394.7398663370477
“Yes; Madame Bonacieux, with whose retreat the cardinal was	429.9245823743373
unacquainted.”	408.33657680604244
“Well, well,” said Rochefort, “here is a chance which may pair off with	295.02389802915803
the other! Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man!”	302.19220540668897
“Imagine my astonishment,” continued Milady, “when I found myself face	468.770978532985
to face with this woman!”	384.5431437674191
“Does she know you?”	292.09934358491984
“No.”	431.7433940337283
“Then she looks upon you as a stranger?”	473.74744858999543
Milady smiled. “I am her best friend.”	403.1598692778314
“Upon my honor,” said Rochefort, “it takes you, my dear countess, to	464.37265018842663
perform such miracles!”	381.60449306177543
“And it is well I can, Chevalier,” said Milady, “for do you know what	433.839314653519
is going on here?”	479.7727294704357
“No.”	381.29451736765054
“They will come for her tomorrow or the day after, with an order from	350.31450207587176
the queen.”	317.9885679813429
“Indeed! And who?”	454.3638128344113
“D’Artagnan and his friends.”	381.5520075862488
“Indeed, they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to	425.8717792356042
the Bastille.”	345.33802521899463
“Why is it not done already?”	429.9495960826123
“What would you? The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I	319.88432782618713
cannot comprehend.”	357.3475076223648
“Indeed!”	400.8950955712867
“Yes.”	490.2236650490278
“Well, then, tell him this, Rochefort. Tell him that our conversation	443.9283655382073
at the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men; tell him	354.8622863299656
that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by	339.64718111497837
violence the safe-conduct which he had given me; tell him they warned	478.7797779762138
Lord de Winter of my journey to England; that this time they nearly	350.05033378876226
foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs; tell him that	309.86699757749045
among these four men two only are to be feared—D’Artagnan and Athos;	407.16939025947306
tell him that the third, Aramis, is the lover of Madame de Chevreuse—he	295.1137616743399
may be left alone, we know his secret, and it may be useful; as to the	322.5676733897839
fourth, Porthos, he is a fool, a simpleton, a blustering booby, not	467.3134490986938
worth troubling himself about.”	451.4609507683802
“But these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle?”	313.2179954883311
“I thought so, too; but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received	296.1327134793128
from Madame the Constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show	371.56019855519224
me, leads me to believe that these four men, on the contrary, are on	417.4718413505847
the road hither to take her away.”	435.41472754471044
“The devil! What’s to be done?”	357.84986193704583
“What did the cardinal say about me?”	406.9621278657632
“I was to take your dispatches, written or verbal, and return by post;	295.8758044058488
and when he shall know what you have done, he will advise what you have	295.0927847489198
to do.”	311.5464016021904
“I must, then, remain here?”	447.80718630833985
“Here, or in the neighborhood.”	372.4723893424177
“You cannot take me with you?”	480.363562711608
“No, the order is imperative. Near the camp you might be recognized;	361.74499686637114
and your presence, you must be aware, would compromise the cardinal.”	426.9408732482897
“Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?”	483.93726265872743
“Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the	412.0156036974529
cardinal; let me know always where to find you.”	432.0567967219806
“Observe, it is probable that I may not be able to remain here.”	364.65922221639033
“Why?”	314.0174509340744
“You forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute.”	300.6476970051323
“That’s true; but is this little woman, then, to escape his Eminence?”	355.6281989261671
“Bah!” said Milady, with a smile that belonged only to herself; “you	334.432707141534
forget that I am her best friend.”	372.5836531110756
“Ah, that’s true! I may then tell the cardinal, with respect to this	363.0231746811005
little woman—”	461.0644093429967
“That he may be at ease.”	300.73997210156693
“Is that all?”	468.33425516830744
“He will know what that means.”	404.96824911668557
“He will guess, at least. Now, then, what had I better do?”	377.5172942597205
“Return instantly. It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the	459.3640118234522
trouble of a little diligence.”	329.0976148993592
“My chaise broke down coming into Lilliers.”	341.1186573092589
“Capital!”	356.9687322664688
“What, _capital?_”	302.14451534387433
“Yes, I want your chaise.”	469.13384207543515
“And how shall I travel, then?”	405.35239170898916
“On horseback.”	327.78633041891163
“You talk very comfortably,—a hundred and eighty leagues!”	470.21227573574595
“What’s that?”	463.3029407921364
“One can do it! Afterward?”	434.62461916755564
“Afterward? Why, in passing through Lilliers you will send me your	449.9519919329493
chaise, with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal.”	347.199539299748
“Well.”	449.90354898375557
“You have, no doubt, some order from the cardinal about you?”	326.6743122439787
“I have my _full power_.”	378.49909857507043
“Show it to the abbess, and tell her that someone will come and fetch	394.4852137483841
me, either today or tomorrow, and that I am to follow the person who	484.7200166505295
presents himself in your name.”	343.82073245090356
“Very well.”	395.94566957532885
“Don’t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess.”	419.84671977626215
“To what purpose?”	491.6246812576561
“I am a victim of the cardinal. It is necessary to inspire confidence	310.6198442109376
in that poor little Madame Bonacieux.”	452.8611644796197
“That’s true. Now, will you make me a report of all that has happened?”	383.67855119731803
“Why, I have related the events to you. You have a good memory; repeat	302.27569053377493
what I have told you. A paper may be lost.”	292.54872180567935
“You are right; only let me know where to find you that I may not run	466.59958420474015
needlessly about the neighborhood.”	427.81251848914985
“That’s correct; wait!”	489.7895631296189
“Do you want a map?”	362.57320439407727
“Oh, I know this country marvelously!”	351.273056741458
“You? When were you here?”	359.7229884010061
“I was brought up here.”	478.91144888666133
“Truly?”	436.41178662956423
“It is worth something, you see, to have been brought up somewhere.”	401.30874383694714
“You will wait for me, then?”	473.2719961822273
“Let me reflect a little! Ay, that will do—at Armentières.”	474.4483405722765
“Where is that Armentières?”	426.09794162232697
“A little town on the Lys; I shall only have to cross the river, and I	399.30585219863497
shall be in a foreign country.”	403.3845882592575
“Capital! but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of	380.48502550381954
danger.”	328.17200939793713
“That is well understood.”	346.1797124664171
“And in that case, how shall I know where you are?”	486.0020636093906
“You do not want your lackey?”	381.872775186595
“Is he a sure man?”	380.3619837541126
“To the proof.”	485.07201292816484
“Give him to me. Nobody knows him. I will leave him at the place I	297.2509286007838
quit, and he will conduct you to me.”	336.88226137638895
“And you say you will wait for me at Armentières?”	373.595079687335
“At Armentières.”	332.40465993398396
“Write that name on a bit of paper, lest I should forget it. There is	356.05472750542083
nothing compromising in the name of a town. Is it not so?”	476.54954376181706
“Eh, who knows? Never mind,” said Milady, writing the name on half a	452.13327203422125
sheet of paper; “I will compromise myself.”	446.66684127257406
“Well,” said Rochefort, taking the paper from Milady, folding it, and	452.5975981608191
placing it in the lining of his hat, “you may be easy. I will do as	415.6958834055112
children do, for fear of losing the paper—repeat the name along the	463.1267140721992
route. Now, is that all?”	400.4984471580151
“I believe so.”	431.22511962830805
“Let us see: Buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation	433.2697535379468
with the cardinal overheard by the four Musketeers; Lord de Winter	414.6442606667649
warned of your arrival at Portsmouth; D’Artagnan and Athos to the	301.7929198523688
Bastille; Aramis the lover of Madame de Chevreuse; Porthos an ass;	319.65821778469564
Madame Bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as	302.61963083767847
possible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim	340.6802060064585
of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;	310.58299014975233
Armentières, on the banks of the Lys. Is that all, then?”	422.3874523981817
“In truth, my dear Chevalier, you are a miracle of memory. _A propos_,	294.6540971000833
add one thing—”	308.3135544320633
“What?”	341.41780124911315
“I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden.	470.6637558609957
Say that I am permitted to walk in those woods. Who knows? Perhaps I	360.7154855911394
shall stand in need of a back door for retreat.”	316.7299798109356
“You think of everything.”	294.82570943585694
“And you forget one thing.”	308.71468746201975
“What?”	378.2177598326112
“To ask me if I want money.”	441.13448223185776
“That’s true. How much do you want?”	391.9990428003265
“All you have in gold.”	490.8599519515265
“I have five hundred pistoles, or thereabouts.”	476.24818068411645
“I have as much. With a thousand pistoles one may face everything.	434.59735596752313
Empty your pockets.”	358.7806556869927
“There.”	358.1142389420979
“Right. And you go—”	423.71582797760766
“In an hour—time to eat a morsel, during which I shall send for a post	410.72677334597427
horse.”	467.5831444125715
“Capital! Adieu, Chevalier.”	404.6101838546489
“Adieu, Countess.”	479.97923652958826
“Commend me to the cardinal.”	443.4137351195053
“Commend me to Satan.”	478.3495489180569
Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated. An hour afterward	329.4344500845616
Rochefort set out at a grand gallop; five hours after that he passed	361.6010339977655
through Arras.	468.58431789612183
Our readers already know how he was recognized by D’Artagnan, and how	344.0869914227381
that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given	489.595109874404
fresh activity to their journey.	391.80743357777794
Chapter LXIII.	314.9001757925308
THE DROP OF WATER	422.82346094503487
Rochefort had scarcely departed when Mme. Bonacieux re-entered. She	448.00705524252794
found Milady with a smiling countenance.	348.1035013377408
“Well,” said the young woman, “what you dreaded has happened. This	444.40362960392906
evening, or tomorrow, the cardinal will send someone to take you away.”	363.89364901145314
“Who told you that, my dear?” asked Milady.	378.9891810958752
“I heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself.”	395.9992557906391
“Come and sit down close to me,” said Milady.	354.9934693686665
“Here I am.”	301.159582130715
“Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears us.”	409.1300877558575
“Why all these precautions?”	374.04320242294176
“You shall know.”	464.626632068376
Milady arose, went to the door, opened it, looked in the corridor, and	360.3463774663452
then returned and seated herself close to Mme. Bonacieux.	411.02140115283555
“Then,” said she, “he has well played his part.”	391.2360775092609
“Who has?”	328.81081962703746
“He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from	307.1649156378029
the cardinal.”	460.03445324374707
“It was, then, a part he was playing?”	298.12519858674045
“Yes, my child.”	343.5147684294637
“That man, then, was not—”	410.9677973621898
“That man,” said Milady, lowering her voice, “is my brother.”	463.8357688046913
“Your brother!” cried Mme. Bonacieux.	385.84621455978083
“No one must know this secret, my dear, but yourself. If you reveal it	342.52340584840357
to anyone in the world, I shall be lost, and perhaps yourself	371.83113083253374
likewise.”	397.5177635180548
“Oh, my God!”	296.05051376216016
“Listen. This is what has happened: My brother, who was coming to my	340.0750562157423
assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary, met with the	415.3173968880831
emissary of the cardinal, who was coming in search of me. He followed	489.41913535041795
him. At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword, and	471.8340888908018
required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was	347.85781456970824
the bearer. The messenger resisted; my brother killed him.”	414.86016814108535
“Oh!” said Mme. Bonacieux, shuddering.	321.7091751369385
“Remember, that was the only means. Then my brother determined to	357.7948748947655
substitute cunning for force. He took the papers, and presented himself	348.86444377118596
here as the emissary of the cardinal, and in an hour or two a carriage	345.57877479291454
will come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence.”	370.8106163450969
“I understand. It is your brother who sends this carriage.”	345.63739897672167
“Exactly; but that is not all. That letter you have received, and which	295.89265312310107
you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse—”	409.3343041309753
“Well?”	317.0430214740091
“It is a forgery.”	474.3304562975588
“How can that be?”	453.419047805764
“Yes, a forgery; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance	407.0078912168443
when they come to fetch you.”	444.61254967708123
“But it is D’Artagnan that will come.”	405.7252287725319
“Do not deceive yourself. D’Artagnan and his friends are detained at	402.620494013374
the siege of La Rochelle.”	446.9535323019552
“How do you know that?”	314.29437835724394
“My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of	377.17353172897595
Musketeers. You would have been summoned to the gate; you would have	479.8767133138893
believed yourself about to meet friends; you would have been abducted,	447.5002427361999
and conducted back to Paris.”	447.13011038545784
“Oh, my God! My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities. I feel,	474.64823288594846
if this continues,” said Mme. Bonacieux, raising her hands to her	356.7734779639146
forehead, “I shall go mad!”	365.5213093784357
“Stop—”	432.634721591259
“What?”	407.9443731583438
“I hear a horse’s steps; it is my brother setting off again. I should	403.167771865233
like to offer him a last salute. Come!”	432.42451185353735
Milady opened the window, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to join	488.46307285304647
her. The young woman complied.	425.27161243321905
Rochefort passed at a gallop.	387.761484904225
“Adieu, brother!” cried Milady.	339.20290078749304
The chevalier raised his head, saw the two young women, and without	459.4863824176542
stopping, waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady.	354.5968790867458
“The good George!” said she, closing the window with an expression of	348.15771805598837
countenance full of affection and melancholy. And she resumed her seat,	413.47738585754644
as if plunged in reflections entirely personal.	430.59447867409386
“Dear lady,” said Mme. Bonacieux, “pardon me for interrupting you; but	293.16021685960214
what do you advise me to do? Good heaven! You have more experience than	424.47654675329454
I have. Speak; I will listen.”	381.1538126914787
“In the first place,” said Milady, “it is possible I may be deceived,	433.79485689967964
and that D’Artagnan and his friends may really come to your	325.35585166949056
assistance.”	313.0055319237554
“Oh, that would be too much!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “so much happiness	295.06409272493823
is not in store for me!”	326.7512065276976
“Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time, a sort of	380.8088684288458
race, which should arrive first. If your friends are the more speedy,	449.4914317852589
you are to be saved; if the satellites of the cardinal, you are lost.”	486.5716606755017
“Oh, yes, yes; lost beyond redemption! What, then, to do? What to do?”	460.31511785449857
“There would be a very simple means, very natural—”	315.8162031885197
“Tell me what!”	431.43567508857217
“To wait, concealed in the neighborhood, and assure yourself who are	359.05419086436814
the men who come to ask for you.”	363.249989336708
“But where can I wait?”	445.6059131288723
“Oh, there is no difficulty in that. I shall stop and conceal myself a	322.341789589943
few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me. Well, I take you with	448.27184801937966
me; we conceal ourselves, and wait together.”	332.9607574373373
“But I shall not be allowed to go; I am almost a prisoner.”	312.15462464149647
“As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the	305.9070426711851
cardinal, no one will believe you anxious to follow me.”	481.3493104814547
“Well?”	394.67263345043375
“Well! The carriage is at the door; you bid me adieu; you mount the	429.73145413525776
step to embrace me a last time; my brother’s servant, who comes to	335.90608271486667
fetch me, is told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion,	385.6440767962401
and we set off at a gallop.”	337.0584487935037
“But D’Artagnan! D’Artagnan! if he comes?”	381.24009510568015
“Shall we not know it?”	421.44540977770475
“How?”	298.17394927732795
“Nothing easier. We will send my brother’s servant back to Béthune,	420.9002851799733
whom, as I told you, we can trust. He shall assume a disguise, and	461.9290615522467
place himself in front of the convent. If the emissaries of the	448.36917598350095
cardinal arrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur d’Artagnan	488.4450449641295
and his friends, he will bring them to us.”	408.3526321363527
“He knows them, then?”	301.599415746182
“Doubtless. Has he not seen Monsieur d’Artagnan at my house?”	384.8846963256861
“Oh, yes, yes; you are right. Thus all may go well—all may be for the	353.2483056932769
best; but we do not go far from this place?”	428.08025631062935
“Seven or eight leagues at the most. We will keep on the frontiers, for	430.67388188070896
instance; and at the first alarm we can leave France.”	414.7819793069608
“And what can we do there?”	434.6543791404522
“Wait.”	472.3198730950928
“But if they come?”	355.29780477717856
“My brother’s carriage will be here first.”	401.3210908199481
“If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes	408.7647421554957
for you—at dinner or supper, for instance?”	313.2258868381
“Do one thing.”	403.9886367382693
“What is that?”	336.0300898895036
“Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together	419.91207164295554
as possible, you ask her permission to share my repast.”	294.15524433382325
“Will she permit it?”	457.99594402693185
“What inconvenience can it be?”	457.7668496374255
“Oh, delightful! In this way we shall not be separated for an instant.”	364.91407186563384
“Well, go down to her, then, to make your request. I feel my head a	448.65545635231126
little confused; I will take a turn in the garden.”	394.06471864639883
“Go; and where shall I find you?”	478.78710197129425
“Here, in an hour.”	468.01262882989477
“Here, in an hour. Oh, you are so kind, and I am so grateful!”	380.63867042949886
“How can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so	302.25299171722554
amiable? Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?”	333.09725422284777
“Dear D’Artagnan! Oh, how he will thank you!”	373.72298748490743
“I hope so. Now, then, all is agreed; let us go down.”	413.97344569627126
“You are going into the garden?”	417.61845649457865
“Yes.”	364.44049988971216
“Go along this corridor, down a little staircase, and you are in it.”	376.9240314444363
“Excellent; thank you!”	310.867750877963
And the two women parted, exchanging charming smiles.	301.0952918997259
Milady had told the truth—her head was confused, for her ill-arranged	414.2900434483494
plans clashed one another like chaos. She required to be alone that she	423.5611338817108
might put her thoughts a little into order. She saw vaguely the future;	473.1759222865033
but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her	312.96950083484387
ideas, as yet confused, a distinct form and a regular plan.	339.54452124378776
What was most pressing was to get Mme. Bonacieux away, and convey her	374.0277674960011
to a place of safety, and there, if matters required, make her a	305.26578235015006
hostage. Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible	387.4983632325292
duel, in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did	372.3014958971302
animosity.	338.75677931326743
Besides, she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on—that this issue	330.7989411337149
was near, and could not fail to be terrible.	402.30158667062807
The principal thing for her, then, was, as we have said, to keep Mme.	364.37115435671086
Bonacieux in her power. Mme. Bonacieux was the very life of D’Artagnan.	341.4359364369892
This was more than his life, the life of the woman he loved; this was,	299.0692953345082
in case of ill fortune, a means of temporizing and obtaining good	322.4358993823946
conditions.	418.5636472807612
Now, this point was settled; Mme. Bonacieux, without any suspicion,	350.96017576102406
accompanied her. Once concealed with her at Armentières, it would be	345.082627008699
easy to make her believe that D’Artagnan had not come to Béthune. In	359.37232177398477
fifteen days at most, Rochefort would be back; besides, during that	314.94429214580623
fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge	327.26336174548186
herself on the four friends. She would not be weary, thank God! for she	326.83917185284383
should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of	453.52057433182586
her character—perfecting a beautiful vengeance.	443.36231067927565
Revolving all this in her mind, she cast her eyes around her, and	436.55120374948035
arranged the topography of the garden in her head. Milady was like a	397.2710656177732
good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat, and	458.60118303970376
who is quite prepared, according to the chances of the battle, to march	448.34689247255545
forward or to beat a retreat.	467.99079622206295
At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her; it was Mme.	349.18152184733555
Bonacieux’s. The good abbess had naturally consented to her request;	354.63052776738704
and as a commencement, they were to sup together.	373.25972564210423
On reaching the courtyard, they heard the noise of a carriage which	462.07797196085994
stopped at the gate.	487.4808008234096
Milady listened.	302.6756019792141
“Do you hear anything?” said she.	441.83224691546957
“Yes, the rolling of a carriage.”	360.38127922785236
“It is the one my brother sends for us.”	308.58481816778
“Oh, my God!”	395.36844527304044
“Come, come! courage!”	422.3488707910849
The bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken.	394.1654797482217
“Go to your chamber,” said she to Mme. Bonacieux; “you have perhaps	446.63663955383765
some jewels you would like to take.”	409.1746106364521
“I have his letters,” said she.	480.9958088463825
“Well, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some	375.21816412471856
supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our	471.62476280571263
strength up.”	320.00656333892044
“Great God!” said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, “my	316.11637100220486
heart beats so I cannot walk.”	309.6087638129347
“Courage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be	466.4052193202941
safe; and think that what you are about to do is for _his_ sake.”	365.36186535118014
“Yes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single	358.165013521484
word; go, I will rejoin you.”	366.27340275555343
Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort’s	471.5135057210556
lackey, and gave him his instructions.	467.1507246324527
He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear,	358.4118656747352
the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the	375.80761474155446
convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was	392.33028813013556
situated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross	359.352440144159
the garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said,	379.2644636318717
Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France.	491.3183794022059
If the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been	390.3200053003595
agreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her	440.99182291550284
adieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux.	465.10844793265875
Mme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any,	372.7340865127352
Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her	437.42542295809193
instructions.	323.84224934905075
Milady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn	360.38251673777313
by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort’s lackey would	358.3342657994755
precede it, as courier.	335.5475842712156
Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any	484.17143719608714
suspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female	343.07584634469254
could be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de	412.8674010258602
Winter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown to	350.778445937676
her, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so	417.996469855281
fatal a share in the misfortune of her life.	438.3553111826335
“You see,” said she, when the lackey had gone out, “everything is	472.63188414462024
ready. The abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by	364.0045627356328
order of the cardinal. This man goes to give his last orders; take the	301.69298934963734
least thing, drink a finger of wine, and let us be gone.”	412.30220985391065
“Yes,” said Mme. Bonacieux, mechanically, “yes, let us be gone.”	439.6676978915537
Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite, poured her a small glass	411.85489077509646
of Spanish wine, and helped her to the wing of a chicken.	474.5910609303055
“See,” said she, “if everything does not second us! Here is night	364.0561816160203
coming on; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody	414.08073362324717
can guess where we are. Come, courage! take something.”	442.6402923311345
Mme. Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically, and just touched the	327.2590926133514
glass with her lips.	432.1370351678246
“Come, come!” said Milady, lifting hers to her mouth, “do as I do.”	424.6243342176535
But at the moment the glass touched her lips, her hand remained	311.10838765445396
suspended; she heard something on the road which sounded like the	415.5484283011408
rattling of a distant gallop. Then it grew nearer, and it seemed to	451.449153262934
her, almost at the same time, that she heard the neighing of horses.	450.21230956807244
This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper	436.90801681341475
in the midst of a happy dream; she grew pale and ran to the window,	325.3556134282518
while Mme. Bonacieux, rising all in a tremble, supported herself upon	318.00894689732525
her chair to avoid falling. Nothing was yet to be seen, only they heard	413.127804856759
the galloping draw nearer.	346.88951527832023
“Oh, my God!” said Mme. Bonacieux, “what is that noise?”	418.45343112222093
“That of either our friends or our enemies,” said Milady, with her	343.4327757722801
terrible coolness. “Stay where you are, I will tell you.”	343.0605971506446
Mme. Bonacieux remained standing, mute, motionless, and pale as a	402.64517896561335
statue.	443.54430429497717
The noise became louder; the horses could not be more than a hundred	470.8199723856452
and fifty paces distant. If they were not yet to be seen, it was	293.49421981266937
because the road made an elbow. The noise became so distinct that the	472.71011604672486
horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs.	293.773516636082
Milady gazed with all the power of her attention; it was just light	441.8962309926213
enough for her to see who was coming.	304.02059061273593
All at once, at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced	452.399479169125
hats and the waving of feathers; she counted two, then five, then eight	485.85227451526225
horsemen. One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his	486.33201430063014
horse.	302.01373183683097
Milady uttered a stifled groan. In the first horseman she recognized	347.3204922316529
D’Artagnan.	327.7269644695012
“Oh, my God, my God,” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “what is it?”	469.4010620281283
“It is the uniform of the cardinal’s Guards. Not an instant to be lost!	343.44762292288766
Fly, fly!”	378.9589882656968
“Yes, yes, let us fly!” repeated Mme. Bonacieux, but without being able	344.6071131940175
to make a step, glued as she was to the spot by terror.	454.87651483091105
They heard the horsemen pass under the windows.	398.2236114049114
“Come, then, come, then!” cried Milady, trying to drag the young woman	401.33013349440654
along by the arm. “Thanks to the garden, we yet can flee; I have the	485.68929269452394
key, but make haste! in five minutes it will be too late!”	476.912215593825
Mme. Bonacieux tried to walk, made two steps, and sank upon her knees.	377.47938273392305
Milady tried to raise and carry her, but could not do it.	459.58071270389087
At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage, which at the	325.0733768505737
approach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop. Then three or four	354.06670867549485
shots were fired.	316.76558427644295
“For the last time, will you come?” cried Milady.	475.509963352054
“Oh, my God, my God! you see my strength fails me; you see plainly I	442.92862142903687
cannot walk. Flee alone!”	388.76868821567257
“Flee alone, and leave you here? No, no, never!” cried Milady.	383.4332363964252
All at once she paused, a livid flash darted from her eyes; she ran to	480.3327109404146
the table, emptied into Mme. Bonacieux’s glass the contents of a ring	363.75423104025367
which she opened with singular quickness. It was a grain of a reddish	408.86713096090807
color, which dissolved immediately.	414.76390372391495
Then, taking the glass with a firm hand, she said, “Drink. This wine	488.9240701130791
will give you strength, drink!” And she put the glass to the lips of	385.2464688258758
the young woman, who drank mechanically.	357.2493680346688
“This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself,” said Milady,	482.82838879715933
replacing the glass upon the table, with an infernal smile, “but, my	333.13600757702386
faith! we do what we can!” And she rushed out of the room.	350.67842249103194
Mme. Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her; she was	478.38287203426546
like people who dream they are pursued, and who in vain try to walk.	473.93015201799824
A few moments passed; a great noise was heard at the gate. Every	427.565974570388
instant Mme. Bonacieux expected to see Milady, but she did not return.	327.67332239549313
Several times, with terror, no doubt, the cold sweat burst from her	474.0181977383395
burning brow.	478.4587337157306
At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates; the	392.37815991004237
noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs. There was a great	318.04964242470186
murmur of voices which continued to draw near, amid which she seemed to	311.45209923730505
hear her own name pronounced.	431.3388733634466
All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy, and darted toward the door;	357.4893612066615
she had recognized the voice of D’Artagnan.	382.67682040079785
“D’Artagnan! D’Artagnan!” cried she, “is it you? This way! this way!”	453.96684367113085
“Constance? Constance?” replied the young man, “where are you? where	449.3435331167118
are you? My God!”	338.9303462115825
At the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than	407.46710189473526
opened; several men rushed into the chamber. Mme. Bonacieux had sunk	477.0010065914366
into an armchair, without the power of moving.	332.7092794323171
D’Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,	429.1753324610353
and fell on his knees before his mistress. Athos replaced his in his	450.4867140816352
belt; Porthos and Aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,	467.31450771840093
returned them to their scabbards.	298.6840115879209
“Oh, D’Artagnan, my beloved D’Artagnan! You have come, then, at last!	357.2158136107155
You have not deceived me! It is indeed thee!”	414.46789223831
“Yes, yes, Constance. Reunited!”	365.2315092684055
“Oh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! I hoped in silence.	360.2241479738434
I was not willing to fly. Oh, I have done well! How happy I am!”	294.58023639616727
At this word _she_, Athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.	307.248433221631
“_She!_ What she?” asked D’Artagnan.	439.4367686066231
“Why, my companion. She who out of friendship for me wished to take me	359.8079231589343
from my persecutors. She who, mistaking you for the cardinal’s Guards,	358.8771100214801
has just fled away.”	436.83872028813516
“Your companion!” cried D’Artagnan, becoming more pale than the white	488.3686823939957
veil of his mistress. “Of what companion are you speaking, dear	429.203138566846
Constance?”	476.82845701485485
“Of her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself	364.5405693219568
your friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything.”	331.0930052932385
“Her name, her name!” cried D’Artagnan. “My God, can you not remember	337.9042584966011
her name?”	463.6454574633484
“Yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. Stop—but—it is very	361.80819269139266
strange—oh, my God, my head swims! I cannot see!”	457.895760512657
“Help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold,” cried D’Artagnan.	386.5942579337756
“She is ill! Great God, she is losing her senses!”	377.4961337936219
While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong	362.4935435561216
voice, Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped	470.0373800712458
at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the	378.0433271981884
countenance of Athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising	357.360689783834
from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the	409.6027831311601
glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.	388.1673318779344
“Oh!” said Athos, “oh, no, it is impossible! God would not permit such	439.8740675519414
a crime!”	408.7768796963709
“Water, water!” cried D’Artagnan. “Water!”	298.1800227389771
“Oh, poor woman, poor woman!” murmured Athos, in a broken voice.	459.67016167860646
Mme. Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of D’Artagnan.	451.2121334830056
“She revives!” cried the young man. “Oh, my God, my God, I thank thee!”	369.2497183505743
“Madame!” said Athos, “madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass	402.24893894246236
is this?”	457.6782511707921
“Mine, monsieur,” said the young woman, in a dying voice.	380.05489219185284
“But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?”	450.744745370241
“She.”	408.8824671665093
“But who is _she?_”	351.72022419019095
“Oh, I remember!” said Mme. Bonacieux, “the Comtesse de Winter.”	341.89551650624827
The four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos	428.3292555727723
dominated all the rest.	320.30059721348795
At that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a	357.945918548608
fearful agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of	398.82573035235043
Porthos and Aramis.	355.3025026001157
D’Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be	314.97456323472267
described.	437.8787131142792
“And what do you believe?” His voice was stifled by sobs.	433.04925162940987
“I believe everything,” said Athos, biting his lips till the blood	462.5408331428498
sprang to avoid sighing.	380.0670303371317
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “where art thou? Do not	419.047654373027
leave me! You see I am dying!”	408.0921717854192
D’Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in	411.13327336829764
both his own, and hastened to her. Her beautiful face was distorted	377.8763866606495
with agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive	294.7976921777535
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.	391.70644370973366
“In the name of heaven, run, call! Aramis! Porthos! Call for help!”	362.2996140920775
“Useless!” said Athos, “useless! For the poison which _she_ pours there	397.86460430589455
is no antidote.”	463.64159455700417
“Yes, yes! Help, help!” murmured Mme. Bonacieux; “help!”	369.6102195996209
Then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man	385.55648967276613
between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul	337.92731197411354
passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.	319.261428334194
“Constance, Constance!” cried D’Artagnan.	467.4805556308246
A sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme. Bonacieux, and dwelt for an	344.84394420440026
instant on the lips of D’Artagnan. That sigh was the soul, so chaste	399.3894933616069
and so loving, which reascended to heaven.	433.6789831889483
D’Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. The young man	417.3265298286227
uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy	460.74194821332117
as herself.	328.529531207436
Porthos wept; Aramis pointed toward heaven; Athos made the sign of the	364.0817602633389
cross.	372.2949081553518
At that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those	430.5983263255423
in the chamber. He looked around him and saw Mme. Bonacieux dead, and	314.0025929250049
D’Artagnan in a swoon. He appeared just at that moment of stupor which	448.3479548238052
follows great catastrophes.	336.9641123751908
“I was not deceived,” said he; “here is Monsieur d’Artagnan; and you	331.4779483832724
are his friends, Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.”	379.69645785842863
The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger	362.36572089737354
with astonishment. It seemed to all three that they knew him.	397.83871626366033
“Gentlemen,” resumed the newcomer, “you are, as I am, in search of a	453.8190009472894
woman who,” added he, with a terrible smile, “must have passed this	452.5279336884412
way, for I see a corpse.”	468.71391587881556
The three friends remained mute—for although the voice as well as the	435.7923156945103
countenance reminded them of someone they had seen, they could not	436.7070070408316
remember under what circumstances.	474.47651320456225
“Gentlemen,” continued the stranger, “since you do not recognize a man	407.67837184397547
who probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself. I am Lord	441.9925619750526
de Winter, brother-in-law of that _woman_.”	292.29533602304394
The three friends uttered a cry of surprise.	360.91160077774396
Athos rose, and offering him his hand, “Be welcome, my Lord,” said he,	401.44432082298204
“you are one of us.”	321.9370179324684
“I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth,” said Lord de Winter.	442.711609205543
“I arrived three hours after her at Boulogne. I missed her by twenty	383.06495302520136
minutes at St. Omer. Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her. I	438.1197512435146
was going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you	411.17568434318196
gallop past. I recognized Monsieur d’Artagnan. I called to you, but you	294.9776716838767
did not answer me; I wished to follow you, but my horse was too much	392.30302402199686
fatigued to go at the same pace with yours. And yet it appears, in	483.0642946340044
spite of all your diligence, you have arrived too late.”	344.9488647776135
“You see!” said Athos, pointing to Mme. Bonacieux dead, and to	312.643892696085
D’Artagnan, whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life.	411.7396630732397
“Are they both dead?” asked Lord de Winter, sternly.	388.9025319600897
“No,” replied Athos, “fortunately Monsieur d’Artagnan has only	399.7076534101926
fainted.”	487.78252109140954
“Ah, indeed, so much the better!” said Lord de Winter.	479.33150770660603
At that moment D’Artagnan opened his eyes. He tore himself from the	387.90112051238
arms of Porthos and Aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the	430.15966725838166
corpse of his mistress.	425.5166455260277
Athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,	446.1476948497914
embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to	387.84531608997315
him with his noble and persuasive voice, “Friend, be a man! Women weep	458.42315394434115
for the dead; men avenge them!”	353.5516352352215
“Oh, yes!” cried D’Artagnan, “yes! If it be to avenge her, I am ready	436.1147885429216
to follow you.”	447.72027270634015
Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance	468.80380895578844
restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis	473.1444106770085
to go and fetch the superior.	460.6757918097461
The two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much	462.53619060301844
upset by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against	366.05364290153796
all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.	388.3850632041359
“Madame,” said Athos, passing his arm under that of D’Artagnan, “we	293.33939868319493
abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. She was	436.83283428519684
an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. Treat her as one of	401.8225454882038
your sisters. We will return someday to pray over her grave.”	313.8734098797669
D’Artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos, and sobbed aloud.	442.63164082632267
“Weep,” said Athos, “weep, heart full of love, youth, and life! Alas,	419.8225014299283
would I could weep like you!”	322.76004666444925
And he drew away his friend, as affectionate as a father, as consoling	418.6416729346756
as a priest, noble as a man who has suffered much.	316.7321093695483
All five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their	413.92878966922467
way to the town of Béthune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped	354.7986689503411
before the first inn they came to.	306.60603478489367
“But,” said D’Artagnan, “shall we not pursue that woman?”	473.81178785120323
“Later,” said Athos. “I have measures to take.”	393.4805753024558
“She will escape us,” replied the young man; “she will escape us, and	339.89276281618993
it will be your fault, Athos.”	334.0490169638409
“I will be accountable for her,” said Athos.	441.80561707871095
D’Artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he	354.78512463304116
lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.	308.1635454268127
Porthos and Aramis regarded each other, not understanding this	336.4661382798919
assurance of Athos.	465.1369052520725
Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of	304.7103674620082
D’Artagnan.	363.994254847568
“Now, gentlemen,” said Athos, when he had ascertained there were five	297.75773760489375
chambers free in the hôtel, “let everyone retire to his own apartment.	438.78941511191806
D’Artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. I take charge of	358.09140208165144
everything; be easy.”	329.6050918500051
“It appears, however,” said Lord de Winter, “if there are any measures	361.8131087449796
to take against the countess, it concerns me; she is my sister-in-law.”	318.26725243972453
“And me,” said Athos, “—she is my wife!”	374.346919326919
D’Artagnan smiled—for he understood that Athos was sure of his	446.9177121282972
vengeance when he revealed such a secret. Porthos and Aramis looked at	454.8276547521833
each other, and grew pale. Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad.	333.04140702208707
“Now, retire to your chambers,” said Athos, “and leave me to act. You	391.228943481422
must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. Only,	346.0372709616287
D’Artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from	473.7505894487946
that man’s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of—”	489.31324362207675
“Ah,” said D’Artagnan, “I comprehend! that name written in her hand.”	399.0572231012266
“You see, then,” said Athos, “there is a god in heaven still!”	368.2563235992557
Chapter LXIV.	421.6382073475082
THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK	413.80612265761
The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only	458.57612716642745
rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that	340.42290298555304
extraordinary man.	314.938690033144
Possessed by one single thought—that of the promise he had made, and of	459.94423367812476
the responsibility he had taken—he retired last to his chamber, begged	406.14132484204447
the host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined	313.67099787753426
every line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different	444.81505337969503
roads from Béthune to Armentières, and summoned the lackeys.	302.9238401134926
Planchet, Grimaud, Bazin, and Mousqueton presented themselves, and	464.8051969944016
received clear, positive, and serious orders from Athos.	377.5173914742606
They must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to	486.24036152036103
Armentières—each by a different route. Planchet, the most intelligent	429.2131175266346
of the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon	351.4192794501835
which the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be	451.15245083481614
remembered, by Rochefort’s servant.	407.2826632457922
Athos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been	425.56819894129205
in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of	423.6650698044647
them different and essential qualities. Then, lackeys who ask questions	384.8535604613211
inspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among	385.6991863775239
those to whom they address themselves. Besides, Milady knew the	454.497271704341
masters, and did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys	423.45500070658227
knew Milady perfectly.	486.97262548244623
All four were to meet the next day at eleven o’clock. If they had	478.6146467956037
discovered Milady’s retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth	425.854182804783
was to return to Béthune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide	448.0715487296735
to the four friends. These arrangements made, the lackeys retired.	376.8826594765673
Athos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself	380.3274886071313
in his cloak, and left the hôtel. It was nearly ten o’clock. At ten	304.52257800874156
o’clock in the evening, it is well known, the streets in provincial	449.2029117710524
towns are very little frequented. Athos nevertheless was visibly	449.10094853554745
anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question. At length he	372.1981490953658
met a belated passenger, went up to him, and spoke a few words to him.	406.5434919908432
The man he addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few	316.9532364907573
words of the Musketeer by pointing. Athos offered the man half a	302.7569738964558
pistole to accompany him, but the man refused.	305.29571573522765
Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his	462.7452775528911
finger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly	445.29631747568675
embarrassed. Nevertheless, as the crossroads offered him a better	360.2704706101339
chance than any other place of meeting somebody, he stood still. In a	468.9842887792795
few minutes a night watch passed. Athos repeated to him the same	450.70344719942045
question he had asked the first person he met. The night watch evinced	350.74202784005337
the same terror, refused, in his turn, to accompany Athos, and only	455.4277596592327
pointed with his hand to the road he was to take.	316.06279779944833
Athos walked in the direction indicated, and reached the suburb	343.7697269057976
situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he	427.18052997668036
and his friends had entered it. There he again appeared uneasy and	457.79717899733464
embarrassed, and stopped for the third time.	327.5889572785007
Fortunately, a mendicant passed, who, coming up to Athos to ask	340.78753445872246
charity, Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was	438.29334587431083
going. The mendicant hesitated at first, but at the sight of the piece	475.16925749985074
of silver which shone in the darkness he consented, and walked on	294.6629867738862
before Athos.	377.64500863807876
Arrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house,	467.8515929251355
isolated, solitary, and dismal. Athos went toward the house, while the	304.4044017099233
mendicant, who had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could	354.9272202011997
carry him.	442.21363955678186
Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid	491.21341105366366
the red color in which the house was painted. No light appeared through	300.9586139863979
the chinks of the shutters; no noise gave reason to believe that it was	320.600902556836
inhabited. It was dark and silent as the tomb.	465.4206522381499
Three times Athos knocked without receiving an answer. At the third	389.6637426243551
knock, however, steps were heard inside. The door at length was opened,	392.00327413597336
and a man appeared, of high stature, pale complexion, and black hair	357.7075968254298
and beard.	413.7432032899893
Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice, then the tall man	372.90423478758987
made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in. Athos immediately	368.7054900585495
profited by the permission, and the door was closed behind him.	363.1184754610578
The man whom Athos had come so far to seek, and whom he had found with	489.46223900689336
so much trouble, introduced him into his laboratory, where he was	352.38692105858803
engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a	394.93331594129506
skeleton. All the frame was adjusted except the head, which lay on the	339.34037065438406
table.	358.30018977865114
All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house	336.7464467674635
occupied himself with the study of natural science. There were large	407.8947743949773
bottles filled with serpents, ticketed according to their species;	466.27529880032137
dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood,	488.9412595831327
and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs, doubtless possessed of virtues	347.98816320799995
unknown to common men, were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in	457.20520723829816
the corners of the apartment. There was no family, no servant; the tall	484.3649579878175
man alone inhabited this house.	481.68295456077925
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have	469.98454188278964
described, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down	311.63256426253855
near him.	470.17103167749326
Then he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he	385.218617802927
required of him. But scarcely had he expressed his request when the	420.8167636490143
unknown, who remained standing before the Musketeer, drew back with	449.9671161392366
signs of terror, and refused. Then Athos took from his pocket a small	378.6545285743748
paper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and	437.00748087416923
a seal, and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these	367.5577308288198
signs of repugnance. The tall man had scarcely read these lines, seen	378.99858534153105
the signature, and recognized the seal, when he bowed to denote that he	396.2811736997562
had no longer any objection to make, and that he was ready to obey.	452.086392627424
Athos required no more. He arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same	303.93754178645366
way he came, re-entered the hôtel, and went to his apartment.	368.4918468615635
At daybreak D’Artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be	310.9596239289667
done.	476.6202979073478
“To wait,” replied Athos.	440.07470245420694
Some minutes after, the superior of the convent sent to inform the	421.03820786162635
Musketeers that the burial would take place at midday. As to the	379.44131239678626
poisoner, they had heard no tidings of her whatever, only that she must	467.59897065913515
have made her escape through the garden, on the sand of which her	348.4854653516672
footsteps could be traced, and the door of which had been found shut.	489.56557245242794
As to the key, it had disappeared.	411.0291040749274
At the hour appointed, Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to	398.6649447464185
the convent; the bells tolled, the chapel was open, the grating of the	380.82261112752565
choir was closed. In the middle of the choir the body of the victim,	377.0854268328916
clothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed. On each side of the choir	381.57998219722856
and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the	305.94387992253036
whole community of the Carmelites, who listened to the divine service,	298.21556059802356
and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests, without seeing	439.5474695284636
the profane, or being seen by them.	432.2540248933576
At the door of the chapel D’Artagnan felt his courage fall anew, and	472.8916716985477
returned to look for Athos; but Athos had disappeared.	467.98198003497964
Faithful to his mission of vengeance, Athos had requested to be	299.1571811908709
conducted to the garden; and there upon the sand following the light	296.949632312518
steps of this woman, who left sharp tracks wherever she went, he	462.06257309935154
advanced toward the gate which led into the wood, and causing it to be	471.8741544203417
opened, he went out into the forest.	365.24353398906453
Then all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage	410.00316649858837
had disappeared encircled the forest. Athos followed the road for some	434.07622776928315
time, his eyes fixed upon the ground; slight stains of blood, which	355.3205810669613
came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage	315.5481306787811
as a courier, or from one of the horses, dotted the road. At the end of	339.5356246247817
three-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of Festubert, a larger	310.73430106817744
bloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. Between the	387.2188615595921
forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was	441.9236507377282
the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped	349.1488516189248
here. At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the	317.9848902491886
carriage.	314.25822466690863
Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos	406.53001828084746
returned to the hôtel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him.	311.6829988860095
Everything was as Athos had foreseen.	293.2535736717179
Planchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the	384.5206357291966
stains of blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had	326.87752542873795
halted. But he had gone farther than Athos—for at the village of	483.4519285552967
Festubert, while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to	343.88855863088736
ask a question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded	374.3621191043396
man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged	340.6352922629933
to stop, unable to go further. The accident was set down to the account	309.8864891702895
of robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood. The man remained in	368.58916461342676
the village; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her	406.4273224357763
journey.	471.9004220872524
Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her, and found	365.1835816330657
him. He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles; and from Fromelles she	442.4997901838327
had set out for Armentières. Planchet took the crossroad, and by seven	379.3683816626577
o’clock in the morning he was at Armentières.	394.0259821704236
There was but one tavern, the Post. Planchet went and presented himself	374.4637675641006
as a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation. He had	361.6433191961192
not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned	345.83265890214824
that a woman had come there alone about eleven o’clock the night	306.79729583806886
before, had engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hôtel,	451.0501858346448
and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.	338.7326993541343
Planchet had no need to learn more. He hastened to the rendezvous,	467.9960246060303
found the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the	299.15907272252514
outlets of the hôtel, and came to find Athos, who had just received	331.9056474426345
this information when his friends returned.	465.5965140578919
All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild	457.26010747150434
countenance of Aramis.	292.3207822440214
“What is to be done?” asked D’Artagnan.	397.3401962196436
“To wait!” replied Athos.	292.92879055303627
Each retired to his own apartment.	392.269206982577
At eight o’clock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled,	329.9516727527831
and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for	379.7240992592884
the expedition.	425.2557846391276
In an instant all five were ready. Each examined his arms, and put them	429.6395339030564
in order. Athos came down last, and found D’Artagnan already on	408.4924138743876
horseback, and growing impatient.	446.14481611693725
“Patience!” cried Athos; “one of our party is still wanting.”	403.2775844640836
The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought	465.19732407470053
vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.	404.10538772525274
At this moment Planchet brought out Athos’s horse; the Musketeer leaped	337.48650272525936
lightly into the saddle.	388.7602771207084
“Wait for me,” cried he, “I will soon be back,” and he set off at a	346.38948760060913
gallop.	407.41159576097454
In a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,	383.0399783850063
and wrapped in a large red cloak.	307.416825910396
Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another	295.36284360568186
inquiringly. Neither could give the others any information, for all	466.8497853846095
were ignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced	337.42725190727333
that all was as it should be, as it was done by the order of Athos.	301.8860220376177
At nine o’clock, guided by Planchet, the little cavalcade set out,	378.07380153754144
taking the route the carriage had taken.	367.9714998922344
It was a melancholy sight—that of these six men, traveling in silence,	418.3128040432724
each plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as	305.22233605180753
chastisement.	473.65635347864554
Chapter LXV.	410.7326630823899
TRIAL	328.9101624987996
It was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,	384.0438386108835
concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.	467.9806306007382
Occasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along	383.68293980615914
the horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary;	423.8199595060189
the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.	310.7981338046987
Every minute Athos was forced to restrain D’Artagnan, constantly in	350.6985454637538
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which	343.2701038664689
in an instant he again departed from. He had but one thought—to go	479.2480898720482
forward; and he went.	426.54057172108884
They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where	489.83313365710944
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg. At	351.8259581785602
Herlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.	429.12932601767784
Several times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis tried to talk with the	389.32968812517714
man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him	410.13517882586996
he bowed, without response. The travelers then comprehended that there	300.32446902625946
must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and	455.63068496162407
ceased to address themselves to him.	401.99087359741725
The storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly,	356.91764815340105
the thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,	318.1237391058331
whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.	362.6346060179278
The cavalcade trotted on more sharply.	448.4731595088845
A little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst. They spread	473.5502857586189
their cloaks. There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it	375.70037296348426
amid torrents of rain.	340.3186809531749
D’Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of	378.3531612352648
his cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his	293.6112077974105
burning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.	339.3930947716476
The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the	393.54354759837923
Post, a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk	409.9538048328716
with which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into	410.2470890829742
the middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.	296.7421742074361
Athos recognized Grimaud.	358.00005455583823
“What’s the manner?” cried Athos. “Has she left Armentières?”	414.3201780602991
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D’Artagnan ground his teeth.	399.04132449627014
“Silence, D’Artagnan!” said Athos. “I have charged myself with this	372.62303867451976
affair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.”	485.5423010388249
“Where is she?” asked Athos.	392.25001431501835
Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys. “Far from	301.39428247609493
here?” asked Athos.	473.5443446029395
Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.	480.7555003114187
“Alone?” asked Athos.	447.7893099739265
Grimaud made the sign yes.	387.14646369915454
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “she is alone within half a league of us, in	315.1914128077853
the direction of the river.”	467.1272056196858
“That’s well,” said D’Artagnan. “Lead us, Grimaud.”	389.47145505225524
Grimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the	440.205573145269
cavalcade.	460.3010514639013
At the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet,	484.5561959289571
which they forded.	370.9439996476192
By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.	428.06382285801374
“Is she there, Grimaud?” asked Athos.	308.08448353126795
Grimaud shook his head negatively.	322.81086283495176
“Silence, then!” cried Athos.	390.1384451562473
And the troop continued their route.	468.1987036339018
Another flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm,	454.0104462942637
and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a	378.50186995191655
little isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces	417.71807907606285
of a ferry.	407.51114693405617
One window was lighted.	374.7630362038312
“Here we are!” said Athos.	308.4107824880731
At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and	416.75267487333105
came towards them. It was Mousqueton. He pointed his finger to the	321.95421041617004
lighted window.	452.4175265616632
“She is there,” said he.	337.1533509989726
“And Bazin?” asked Athos.	463.115240094432
“While I watched the window, he guarded the door.”	320.7125727072103
“Good!” said Athos. “You are good and faithful servants.”	457.3225549267124
Athos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced	338.23765070026184
toward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to	356.70679551330306
go toward the door.	373.9141677316379
The little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three	448.1351895055759
feet high. Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which	323.05159576287826
was without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.	414.41821293533604
He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the	490.3313104901735
curtain.	312.1825930033985
By the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated	315.4841972290485
upon a stool near a dying fire. Her elbows were placed upon a mean	457.0426119131841
table, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as	465.782681763214
ivory.	408.36898850537455
He could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed	297.5831177915855
over the lips of Athos. He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.	426.36046043598606
At this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to	407.9521382926683
the panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.	456.6593844583171
Athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee	391.20186297618943
and hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and	389.0978994443542
Athos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.	437.04759388197704
Milady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than	414.3804906562171
Athos, D’Artagnan stood on the threshold.	456.59227962583907
Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D’Artagnan, believing she might have	426.7560793184782
means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his	323.0375041847199
belt; but Athos raised his hand.	388.3578463825596
“Put back that weapon, D’Artagnan!” said he; “this woman must be tried,	319.4119222115862
not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be	403.1482738120612
satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.”	443.325446168982
D’Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful	412.004983462106
gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind D’Artagnan entered	415.14443952183683
Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.	372.5546778049581
The four lackeys guarded the door and the window.	440.9428898092228
Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure	416.79283772734107
this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a	324.4125439066424
terrible cry.	368.075092225052
“What do you want?” screamed Milady.	298.9597437039584
“We want,” said Athos, “Charlotte Backson, who first was called	419.8089146654405
Comtesse de la Fère, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of	472.74624410170617
Sheffield.”	301.335773659969
“That is I! that is I!” murmured Milady, in extreme terror; “what do	478.0500212487251
you want?”	300.9924622987281
“We wish to judge you according to your crime,” said Athos; “you shall	389.3810053444515
be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d’Artagnan,	378.653326552046
it is for you to accuse her first.”	310.0556098232474
D’Artagnan advanced.	460.4400752957158
“Before God and before men,” said he, “I accuse this woman of having	380.9472872052462
poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.”	341.77665146057205
He turned towards Porthos and Aramis.	318.5722268691998
“We bear witness to this,” said the two Musketeers, with one voice.	429.3624514137132
D’Artagnan continued: “Before God and before men, I accuse this woman	474.3434639007936
of having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from	398.0250581915278
Villeroy, with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends.	461.89199978627005
God preserved me, but a man named Brisemont died in my place.”	478.2031422408181
“We bear witness to this,” said Porthos and Aramis, in the same manner	449.30274323377057
as before.	418.0461200533197
“Before God and before men, I accuse this woman of having urged me to	329.73724420373986
the murder of the Baron de Wardes; but as no one else can attest the	374.67104392530405
truth of this accusation, I attest it myself. I have done.” And	336.3252434844101
D’Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and	341.4417911070949
Aramis.	341.086940135825
“Your turn, my Lord,” said Athos.	440.25470376155147
The baron came forward.	395.64351572686456
“Before God and before men,” said he, “I accuse this woman of having	351.31739792507784
caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham.”	466.3501254108412
“The Duke of Buckingham assassinated!” cried all present, with one	375.59118734116737
voice.	326.6959935456087
“Yes,” said the baron, “assassinated. On receiving the warning letter	446.193297533391
you wrote to me, I had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a	448.11907798326115
loyal servant. She corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his	343.7493594522206
hand; she made him kill the duke. And at this moment, perhaps, Felton	471.6267829792828
is paying with his head for the crime of this fury!”	471.17759424158214
A shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown	415.6476004485921
crimes.	469.8067329444693
“That is not all,” resumed Lord de Winter. “My brother, who made you	430.5899353393154
his heir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid	404.8345315259765
traces all over the body. My sister, how did your husband die?”	414.370403677174
“Horror!” cried Porthos and Aramis.	484.75967139996595
“Assassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I	352.9718537133737
demand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I	440.00047649272733
will execute it myself.”	490.45714490313765
And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of D’Artagnan, leaving	316.4102255714426
the place free for another accuser.	341.0436318492866
Milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her	413.5419866305558
ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.	337.6657680723518
“My turn,” said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the	424.6023160333495
sight of the serpent—“my turn. I married that woman when she was a	454.0099246042722
young girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family;	423.20685851801113
I gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that	360.82825843480794
this woman was branded—this woman was marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ on	346.90767190173216
her left shoulder.”	332.72715915316655
“Oh,” said Milady, raising herself, “I defy you to find any tribunal	343.44130242904276
which pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find	333.77611939152735
him who executed it.”	463.76853731673634
“Silence!” said a hollow voice. “It is for me to reply to that!” And	488.129052283915
the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn.	328.12829496510096
“What man is that? What man is that?” cried Milady, suffocated by	424.9485134101
terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid	385.7503154454523
countenance as if alive.	333.3140199762779
All eyes were turned towards this man—for to all except Athos he was	297.0604211945627
unknown.	370.33354334150226
Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for	334.6738600235596
he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the	405.4148558191149
horrible drama then unfolded.	292.7697752007423
After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table	294.73864244782726
alone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.	475.73350466533617
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face,	327.31788179451314
framed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was	373.3163518983952
icy impassibility. Then she suddenly cried, “Oh, no, no!” rising and	410.38836535683504
retreating to the very wall. “No, no! it is an infernal apparition! It	466.72218068154064
is not he! Help, help!” screamed she, turning towards the wall, as if	363.01443319702446
she would tear an opening with her hands.	475.4263590493149
“Who are you, then?” cried all the witnesses of this scene.	416.06232258115
“Ask that woman,” said the man in the red cloak, “for you may plainly	392.2457207841436
see she knows me!”	385.64944141943
“The executioner of Lille, the executioner of Lille!” cried Milady, a	409.9242815451851
prey to insensate terror, and clinging with her hands to the wall to	357.9342966560763
avoid falling.	491.1639173844178
Everyone drew back, and the man in the red cloak remained standing	356.9066637159191
alone in the middle of the room.	319.69302316661015
“Oh, grace, grace, pardon!” cried the wretch, falling on her knees.	348.44271042452857
The unknown waited for silence, and then resumed, “I told you well that	298.0355601525323
she would know me. Yes, I am the executioner of Lille, and this is my	300.7065953788449
history.”	441.78697706881235
All eyes were fixed upon this man, whose words were listened to with	414.5433889698119
anxious attention.	351.43442573505183
“That woman was once a young girl, as beautiful as she is today. She	332.42768003476186
was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar. A young	374.4907755637954
priest, with a simple and trustful heart, performed the duties of the	452.0764031428881
church of that convent. She undertook his seduction, and succeeded; she	450.30267340619775
would have seduced a saint.	412.43203920407313
“Their vows were sacred and irrevocable. Their connection could not	310.2558305823002
last long without ruining both. She prevailed upon him to leave the	300.8099887705465
country; but to leave the country, to fly together, to reach another	474.6643929921685
part of France, where they might live at ease because unknown, money	428.6422270297369
was necessary. Neither had any. The priest stole the sacred vases, and	345.6883767153211
sold them; but as they were preparing to escape together, they were	467.93601794609117
both arrested.	337.72143534821686
“Eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer, and escaped.	302.2745256079142
The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment, and to be	332.49210139985775
branded. I was executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has	360.225288986179
said. I was obliged to brand the guilty one; and he, gentlemen, was my	293.30872396787345
brother!	383.8032547787852
“I then swore that this woman who had ruined him, who was more than his	353.5223984036787
accomplice, since she had urged him to the crime, should at least share	376.1689555868612
his punishment. I suspected where she was concealed. I followed her, I	447.77366520552823
caught her, I bound her; and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon	309.8075199638805
her that I had imprinted upon my poor brother.	484.3332414817415
“The day after my return to Lille, my brother in his turn succeeded in	442.249863766815
making his escape; I was accused of complicity, and was condemned to	374.6322424371639
remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner. My poor brother	397.5633128024912
was ignorant of this sentence. He rejoined this woman; they fled	399.15904800917997
together into Berry, and there he obtained a little curacy. This woman	312.23333733191095
passed for his sister.	347.3449912469579
“The Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated	476.63564406534766
saw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her—amorous to such a	393.41572176590245
degree that he proposed to marry her. Then she quitted him she had	412.62139250451645
ruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the Comtesse de la	438.47945840164243
Fère—”	358.1925471979157
All eyes were turned towards Athos, whose real name that was, and who	452.42669342131285
made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had	481.9256564475137
said.	322.2669496161173
“Then,” resumed he, “mad, desperate, determined to get rid of an	378.05011667088496
existence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness, my	416.39460617520064
poor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had	399.37262921331114
condemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that	368.87757985614866
same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.	294.2899215614377
“To do justice to them who had condemned me, they kept their word. As	367.32354188714834
soon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty.	356.11383668797237
“That is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which	431.11848614881364
she was branded.”	336.2481089939927
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Athos, “what is the penalty you demand	305.1280008348192
against this woman?”	461.30981814323036
“The punishment of death,” replied D’Artagnan.	342.71417005961166
“My Lord de Winter,” continued Athos, “what is the penalty you demand	350.4890026708316
against this woman?”	365.2238263429674
“The punishment of death,” replied Lord de Winter.	432.95851541448377
“Messieurs Porthos and Aramis,” repeated Athos, “you who are her	326.83592671019034
judges, what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?”	344.8242763251239
“The punishment of death,” replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice.	392.57548507943505
Milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several	387.65110825036004
paces upon her knees toward her judges.	302.148213902385
Athos stretched out his hand toward her.	408.21734808494114
“Charlotte Backson, Comtesse de la Fère, Milady de Winter,” said he,	349.1516271102141
“your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven. If you know a	380.9847731692398
prayer, say it—for you are condemned, and you shall die.”	433.3678770252285
At these words, which left no hope, Milady raised herself in all her	399.86056448935636
pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. She felt that	350.42989671179663
a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her	340.02092277698415
away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. She did not, therefore,	454.38737236642714
even attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.	331.199032655103
Lord de Winter, D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, went out close	302.0432903086363
behind her. The lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was	466.2926208339703
left solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky	407.82006027167137
lamp burning sadly on the table.	407.6946194570902
Chapter LXVI.	349.155381286935
EXECUTION	438.25584827397336
It was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened	297.4668948092892
by the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of	430.220496288693
Armentières, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of	403.8354086183029
its houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. In front of them the	327.8590717603841
Lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin; while on the other	446.1068368420191
side was a black mass of trees, profiled on a stormy sky, invaded by	321.5120221732915
large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night.	413.17437029253836
On the left was an old abandoned mill, with its motionless wings, from	354.8056443964135
the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill, periodical, and	340.1755931036769
monotonous cry. On the right and on the left of the road, which the	444.4146577908115
dismal procession pursued, appeared a few low, stunted trees, which	362.6244738451176
looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at	365.10204816911994
this sinister hour.	414.08924820768783
From time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its	396.1151167601014
whole width, darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees, and	403.0803054730933
like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two	469.61999185895286
parts. Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. A	446.0577888502553
deathlike silence oppressed all nature. The soil was humid and	462.56457026186627
glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed	413.0383312741898
herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.	349.3897105482555
Two lackeys dragged Milady, whom each held by one arm. The executioner	428.98813659211794
walked behind them, and Lord de Winter, D’Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis	299.1679403791687
walked behind the executioner. Planchet and Bazin came last.	313.1837875490759
The two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river. Her mouth	309.9997415706749
was mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,	483.09018039339844
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.	436.64771660136887
Being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, “A thousand	470.6605497892011
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you	469.5214140288846
deliver me up to your masters, I have near at hand avengers who will	360.5071099049793
make you pay dearly for my death.”	475.90632789110896
Grimaud hesitated. Mousqueton trembled in all his members.	404.83580702518503
Athos, who heard Milady’s voice, came sharply up. Lord de Winter did	380.08647067603545
the same.	465.78695893860885
“Change these lackeys,” said he; “she has spoken to them. They are no	465.66081604800615
longer sure.”	336.1740366556182
Planchet and Bazin were called, and took the places of Grimaud and	317.1065880863417
Mousqueton.	356.0362786677182
On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady, and bound	350.6447267323391
her hands and feet.	356.5157842408215
Then she broke the silence to cry out, “You are cowards, miserable	357.10613935309925
assassins—ten men combined to murder one woman. Beware! If I am not	452.10197016908086
saved I shall be avenged.”	408.444912935407
“You are not a woman,” said Athos, coldly and sternly. “You do not	381.79380096718927
belong to the human species; you are a demon escaped from hell, whither	421.4806199762154
we send you back again.”	358.49679963657934
“Ah, you virtuous men!” said Milady; “please to remember that he who	300.06526861130226
shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin.”	464.5430331873463
“The executioner may kill, without being on that account an assassin,”	350.2452552242582
said the man in the red cloak, rapping upon his immense sword. “This is	362.2770485628432
the last judge; that is all. _Nachrichter_, as say our neighbors, the	444.7089874227263
Germans.”	306.5341820277321
And as he bound her while saying these words, Milady uttered two or	376.0778585692658
three savage cries, which produced a strange and melancholy effect in	472.2379393871146
flying away into the night, and losing themselves in the depths of the	472.9248642609254
woods.	385.7638606768764
“If I am guilty, if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of,”	387.16752521168314
shrieked Milady, “take me before a tribunal. You are not judges! You	450.6168791293644
cannot condemn me!”	475.8991132243333
“I offered you Tyburn,” said Lord de Winter. “Why did you not accept	425.451726008081
it?”	339.5794863220835
“Because I am not willing to die!” cried Milady, struggling. “Because I	362.10543238915915
am too young to die!”	316.2883674661706
“The woman you poisoned at Béthune was still younger than you, madame,	338.4381261788848
and yet she is dead,” said D’Artagnan.	331.7901410771409
“I will enter a cloister; I will become a nun,” said Milady.	416.38856349455216
“You were in a cloister,” said the executioner, “and you left it to	357.1885924763691
ruin my brother.”	326.3764634744417
Milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees. The executioner	375.46006939123134
took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat.	358.7690429112953
“Oh, my God!” cried she, “my God! are you going to drown me?”	488.05908582809036
These cries had something so heartrending in them that M. d’Artagnan,	313.3007679053091
who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady, sat down on	313.86656772731857
the stump of a tree and hung his head, covering his ears with the palms	462.69104287902655
of his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and	404.2650013000518
threaten.	425.9836361239412
D’Artagnan was the youngest of all these men. His heart failed him.	438.6756466733204
“Oh, I cannot behold this frightful spectacle!” said he. “I cannot	487.2503391445781
consent that this woman should die thus!”	383.9174973643528
Milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope.	315.0926268795927
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan!” cried she; “remember that I loved you!”	354.88815440461286
The young man rose and took a step toward her.	399.63581163834414
But Athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.	310.55884999714385
“If you take one step farther, D’Artagnan,” said he, “we shall cross	390.4306152134358
swords together.”	419.23425182987245
D’Artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.	447.1667390559836
“Come,” continued Athos, “executioner, do your duty.”	482.11220356416254
“Willingly, monseigneur,” said the executioner; “for as I am a good	349.27660993343255
Catholic, I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my	309.53558299348185
functions on this woman.”	309.56424293757766
“That’s well.”	433.6168185466438
Athos made a step toward Milady.	297.3950359373433
“I pardon you,” said he, “the ill you have done me. I pardon you for my	338.30018474580885
blasted future, my lost honor, my defiled love, and my salvation	414.70766517029335
forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me. Die in	318.64025507208936
peace!”	413.3690792661266
Lord de Winter advanced in his turn.	382.57853036083975
“I pardon you,” said he, “for the poisoning of my brother, and the	459.9181511646203
assassination of his Grace, Lord Buckingham. I pardon you for the death	298.3081818255535
of poor Felton; I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person. Die	321.58426484472074
in peace!”	437.8669764050612
“And I,” said M. d’Artagnan. “Pardon me, madame, for having by a trick	328.911927377812
unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger; and I, in exchange, pardon	362.32979771982974
you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me. I	350.92278063465307
pardon you, and I weep for you. Die in peace!”	319.6691584206121
“I am lost!” murmured Milady in English. “I must die!”	343.569589956908
Then she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing	299.72773540541687
looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.	342.5885819373204
She saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.	331.4075392214541
“Where am I to die?” said she.	413.5263514116258
“On the other bank,” replied the executioner.	341.298049026965
Then he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it	413.05643949342436
himself, Athos handed him a sum of silver.	477.313704562676
“Here,” said he, “is the price of the execution, that it may be plain	318.81637796405346
we act as judges.”	448.0614648137698
“That is correct,” said the executioner; “and now in her turn, let this	384.7600067761568
woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade, but my debt.”	410.0092210893225
And he threw the money into the river.	454.9827457904254
The boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys, bearing the	430.3850075203942
guilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the	449.1333140281409
right-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.	460.97690539330733
The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud	370.3916148373024
which hung over the water at that moment.	382.81819450940753
The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank; the figures were	367.0245485861066
defined like black shadows on the red-tinted horizon.	383.3492784119288
Milady, during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which	386.7493708399041
fastened her feet. On coming near the bank, she jumped lightly on shore	310.13880363428694
and took to flight. But the soil was moist; on reaching the top of the	469.1225374348456
bank, she slipped and fell upon her knees.	412.8701616539741
She was struck, no doubt, with a superstitious idea; she conceived that	435.95720435164174
heaven denied its aid, and she remained in the attitude in which she	325.6945503016964
had fallen, her head drooping and her hands clasped.	371.5342036826129
Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms	460.7075461397442
slowly; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword. The two arms	465.24780843305894
fell with a sudden force; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and	479.3161038566782
the cry of the victim, then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow.	410.99184040920375
The executioner then took off his red cloak, spread it upon the ground,	310.41068002860834
laid the body in it, threw in the head, tied all up by the four	383.1384322113847
corners, lifted it on his back, and entered the boat again.	435.0708421498626
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat, and suspending his	311.53725489516404
burden over the water cried in a loud voice, “Let the justice of God be	344.5706438819712
done!” and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters, which	455.202948766096
closed over it.	364.2161007581316
Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris; they had not	367.84751332256644
exceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay	448.8572638807818
their customary visit to M. de Tréville.	447.9240597497435
“Well, gentlemen,” said the brave captain, “I hope you have been well	292.5999481297496
amused during your excursion.”	329.45432108881135
“Prodigiously,” replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades.	448.1773489695706
Chapter LXVII.	303.11061852509624
CONCLUSION	325.69139171276845
On the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the	429.27494542382817
promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle, left his	315.95160260808467
capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of	460.4910861852714
Buckingham’s assassination.	395.4259544841002
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger,	384.981955159634
the queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the	402.73490181394743
fact, and even imprudently exclaimed, “it is false; he has just written	378.7385151909649
to me!”	450.99063087312675
But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence;	372.5613466953781
Laporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders	446.14908965910547
of Charles I., arrived, and was the bearer of the duke’s dying gift to	319.91314489575785
the queen.	292.60356570399125
The joy of the king was lively. He did not even give himself the	439.06018163835097
trouble to dissemble, and displayed it with affectation before the	400.30438093592045
queen. Louis XIII., like every weak mind, was wanting in generosity.	475.5202171300444
But the king soon again became dull and indisposed; his brow was not	415.6899941135535
one of those that long remain clear. He felt that in returning to camp	459.4031262365305
he should re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.	335.8776956405293
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird	472.86155172486565
which flies from branch to branch without power to escape.	428.10354434290605
The return to La Rochelle, therefore, was profoundly dull. Our four	360.7056142863075
friends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled	438.5036146923947
together, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered. Athos alone	400.9874597412961
from time to time raised his expansive brow; a flash kindled in his	435.89657242539
eyes, and a bitter smile passed over his lips, then, like his comrades,	411.41672912715194
he sank again into reverie.	320.8689804447167
As soon as the escort arrived in a city, when they had conducted the	451.84478897637405
king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to	337.59264882731475
some secluded cabaret, where they neither drank nor played; they only	391.2497564887121
conversed in a low voice, looking around attentively to see that no one	445.37855822448205
overheard them.	333.4050621495552
One day, when the king had halted to fly the magpie, and the four	408.49479879181666
friends, according to their custom, instead of following the sport had	390.86470710183016
stopped at a cabaret on the high road, a man coming from la Rochelle on	409.0146033067626
horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine, and darted a	365.9277097613388
searching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting.	471.36408069360675
“Holloa, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” said he, “is not that you whom I see	407.6184842310046
yonder?”	394.68246080557844
D’Artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy. It was the man he	304.21167250201086
called his phantom; it was his stranger of Meung, of the Rue des	426.7782917253959
Fossoyeurs and of Arras.	467.30854020516125
D’Artagnan drew his sword, and sprang toward the door.	359.70356092412237
But this time, instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his	487.2790080257648
horse, and advanced to meet D’Artagnan.	387.8600591401981
“Ah, monsieur!” said the young man, “I meet you, then, at last! This	461.2894894008167
time you shall not escape me!”	377.955857153671
“Neither is it my intention, monsieur, for this time I was seeking you;	466.0395469136076
in the name of the king, I arrest you.”	390.4543965702945
“How! what do you say?” cried D’Artagnan.	460.6264891902022
“I say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that	456.0031946857815
without resistance. This concerns your head, I warn you.”	373.3190927912664
“Who are you, then?” demanded D’Artagnan, lowering the point of his	377.9026475754144
sword, but without yet surrendering it.	456.49398331042676
“I am the Chevalier de Rochefort,” answered the other, “the equerry of	359.59021267641424
Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu, and I have orders to conduct you to his	313.50329102253113
Eminence.”	392.52020413385264
“We are returning to his Eminence, monsieur the Chevalier,” said Athos,	326.23481485548774
advancing; “and you will please to accept the word of Monsieur	448.60028738395886
d’Artagnan that he will go straight to La Rochelle.”	371.8540285826323
“I must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp.”	437.8393720236708
“We will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but	423.748290819741
likewise, upon our word as gentlemen,” added Athos, knitting his brow,	415.42476448900857
“Monsieur d’Artagnan shall not leave us.”	428.56797873665107
The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that Porthos	471.7505525515381
and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he	439.70751179495494
understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.	348.2495981530182
“Gentlemen,” said he, “if Monsieur d’Artagnan will surrender his sword	468.5445440465055
to me and join his word to yours, I shall be satisfied with your	396.3673466205779
promise to convey Monsieur d’Artagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur	313.724253222035
the Cardinal.”	436.1911985880196
“You have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword.”	452.84187437918155
“This suits me the better,” said Rochefort, “as I wish to continue my	332.97832050545463
journey.”	466.7411174298968
“If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady,” said Athos, coolly, “it	330.908189131191
is useless; you will not find her.”	344.7170698245584
“What has become of her, then?” asked Rochefort, eagerly.	474.0816955169754
“Return to camp and you shall know.”	326.96463471848716
Rochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a	460.9594716125614
day’s journey from Surgères, whither the cardinal was to come to meet	489.5135675555405
the king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them.	444.99878510990305
Besides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his	404.99969433829364
prisoner.	312.79306382470156
They resumed their route.	393.80789248384724
On the morrow, at three o’clock in the afternoon, they arrived at	404.60823010570493
Surgères. The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the	482.00640684690904
king exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the	452.9734840866678
fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who	348.578140036413
set all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been	315.46906537213675
informed that D’Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him,	482.62426245158565
took leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the	479.7017843034195
work already done upon the dyke.	370.53884738516786
On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre,	485.10927502419383
the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, D’Artagnan,	411.08000275331653
without his sword, and the three Musketeers armed.	449.9192236757917
This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made	482.1881095486723
a sign with his eye and hand for D’Artagnan to follow him.	328.07454150841585
D’Artagnan obeyed.	420.3970298431395
“We shall wait for you, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, loud enough for the	404.73883827707664
cardinal to hear him.	407.5894105645573
His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on	394.9969175844204
his way without uttering a single word.	427.71195280033015
D’Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind D’Artagnan the door	331.5220522534311
was guarded.	415.628211097189
His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made	355.5370099020488
a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer.	470.2344451420455
Rochefort obeyed and retired.	394.32733642812
D’Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second	335.4747003097568
interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well	403.1478280694562
assured it would be his last.	330.7657645828092
Richelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table	331.27773543001126
was between him and D’Artagnan.	335.8169032752649
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “you have been arrested by my orders.”	408.5223567559523
“So they tell me, monseigneur.”	312.0294736051039
“Do you know why?”	384.3175759634675
“No, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is	452.91509298278925
still unknown to your Eminence.”	350.44672281257726
Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man.	473.87905955780604
“Holloa!” said he, “what does that mean?”	349.0095995470789
“If Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place,	489.91804243645055
what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have	460.94935787015265
really done.”	300.64736253367965
“Crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads	462.0076005419041
than yours, monsieur,” said the cardinal.	434.4670726290882
“What, monseigneur?” said D’Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished	348.97790534448933
the cardinal himself.	303.2389178736607
“You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the	366.70977226256343
kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are	389.1965159586905
charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.”	430.8444212427868
“And who charges me with this, monseigneur?” said D’Artagnan, who had	359.2513000244297
no doubt the accusation came from Milady, “a woman branded by the	376.8574052967722
justice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and	379.99405543706524
another in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who	434.56267909559915
attempted both to poison and assassinate me!”	488.83514304710616
“What do you say, monsieur?” cried the cardinal, astonished; “and of	369.45047328800086
what woman are you speaking thus?”	395.348779862065
“Of Milady de Winter,” replied D’Artagnan, “yes, of Milady de Winter,	321.4736334340296
of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have	486.11104898957376
honored her with your confidence.”	319.46479554663233
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “if Milady de Winter has committed the	476.5536595768697
crimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.”	354.192858243411
“She has been punished, monseigneur.”	360.7217617707899
“And who has punished her?”	452.6092857648185
“We.”	313.7778927844443
“She is in prison?”	486.0945794559776
“She is dead.”	466.9866558637319
“Dead!” repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard,	358.1060898087131
“dead! Did you not say she was dead?”	355.94661724069897
“Three times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she	339.4027111035301
murdered the woman I loved. Then my friends and I took her, tried her,	307.10381772339167
and condemned her.”	475.40269518831525
D’Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme. Bonacieux in the convent	410.81445581859094
of the Carmelites at Béthune, the trial in the isolated house, and the	427.5541656149983
execution on the banks of the Lys.	472.68270727307686
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal, who did not shudder	311.8586513923381
readily.	314.74526997482485
But all at once, as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought,	404.96608092039196
the countenance of the cardinal, till then gloomy, cleared up by	326.7510364078047
degrees, and recovered perfect serenity.	396.60127144109185
“So,” said the cardinal, in a tone that contrasted strongly with the	351.4877956695866
severity of his words, “you have constituted yourselves judges, without	462.38479017069085
remembering that they who punish without license to punish are	321.3196775634763
assassins?”	377.8026111486572
“Monseigneur, I swear to you that I never for an instant had the	447.45540657471804
intention of defending my head against you. I willingly submit to any	466.8435814994954
punishment your Eminence may please to inflict upon me. I do not hold	447.12730136497487
life dear enough to be afraid of death.”	313.08560275246856
“Yes, I know you are a man of a stout heart, monsieur,” said the	429.9067076663713
cardinal, with a voice almost affectionate; “I can therefore tell you	419.97792513165166
beforehand you shall be tried, and even condemned.”	447.20223804487705
“Another might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his	353.90056182335525
pocket. I content myself with saying: Command, monseigneur; I am	415.33143249137805
ready.”	359.1964571732712
“Your pardon?” said Richelieu, surprised.	381.21548867167485
“Yes, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan.	292.49723407052835
“And signed by whom—by the king?” And the cardinal pronounced these	463.94152165655294
words with a singular expression of contempt.	479.8382516493103
“No, by your Eminence.”	448.14512273650246
“By me? You are insane, monsieur.”	380.6867802051361
“Monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting.”	389.22265338403264
And D’Artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper	348.87665092874937
which Athos had forced from Milady, and which he had given to	344.4435916685607
D’Artagnan to serve him as a safeguard.	341.76291991157103
His Eminence took the paper, and read in a slow voice, dwelling upon	362.4277538849539
every syllable:	405.1887730008328
“Dec. 3, 1627	433.59442889203876
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of	426.2585808552168
this has done what he has done.	394.9795562917745
“RICHELIEU”	441.4166342204637
The cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound	365.35598252739396
reverie; but he did not return the paper to D’Artagnan.	449.1688223243524
“He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die,”	325.288923020732
said the Gascon to himself. “Well, my faith! he shall see how a	292.18560946063525
gentleman can die.”	409.0221588968094
The young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically.	331.5329091560669
Richelieu still continued thinking, rolling and unrolling the paper in	429.2145573949608
his hands.	442.9962020186149
At length he raised his head, fixed his eagle look upon that loyal,	344.52827823889487
open, and intelligent countenance, read upon that face, furrowed with	345.1824632522786
tears, all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a	350.1862404858734
month, and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in	420.253512903488
that youth of twenty-one years before him, and what resources his	416.9934226077952
activity, his courage, and his shrewdness might offer to a good master.	425.49897369882206
On the other side, the crimes, the power, and the infernal genius of	341.19616912344077
Milady had more than once terrified him. He felt something like a	472.6374953526297
secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice.	329.21972180360495
Richelieu slowly tore the paper which D’Artagnan had generously	401.75321805152015
relinquished.	307.655597067421
“I am lost!” said D’Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before	425.4474143882778
the cardinal, like a man who says, “Lord, Thy will be done!”	306.37356725591593
The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a	363.99552721681073
few lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and	443.7047174840741
affixed his seal.	399.4854172986661
“That is my condemnation,” thought D’Artagnan; “he will spare me the	399.3193369253013
_ennui_ of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That’s very	319.2095649727919
kind of him.”	412.03727682229623
“Here, monsieur,” said the cardinal to the young man. “I have taken	356.93708944023933
from you one _carte blanche_ to give you another. The name is wanting	378.9723133488094
in this commission; you can write it yourself.”	304.89195540814734
D’Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it	409.1376418123606
was a lieutenant’s commission in the Musketeers.	327.816909066868
D’Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal.	324.99628146896566
“Monseigneur,” said he, “my life is yours; henceforth dispose of it.	376.91173888111143
But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three	405.5309951928272
friends who are more meritorious and more worthy—”	447.90993916956353
“You are a brave youth, D’Artagnan,” interrupted the cardinal, tapping	386.4150649818092
him familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this	400.1570618456477
rebellious nature. “Do with this commission what you will; only	457.26098899347164
remember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.”	466.6632758588719
“I shall never forget it,” replied D’Artagnan. “Your Eminence may be	480.5254758515388
certain of that.”	453.7376166751165
The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice, “Rochefort!” The	438.9562549846016
chevalier, who no doubt was near the door, entered immediately.	378.18479956564306
“Rochefort,” said the cardinal, “you see Monsieur d’Artagnan. I receive	386.24507360649784
him among the number of my friends. Greet each other, then; and be wise	374.3127763581763
if you wish to preserve your heads.”	315.1306197872787
Rochefort and D’Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but	330.21277996586394
the cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.	341.50948197930995
They left the chamber at the same time.	326.23370069718965
“We shall meet again, shall we not, monsieur?”	303.90687924032966
“When you please,” said D’Artagnan.	415.8950166685998
“An opportunity will come,” replied Rochefort.	355.6508876294818
“Hey?” said the cardinal, opening the door.	446.16430577881647
The two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his	436.97995969142164
Eminence.	489.32625401337214
“We were beginning to grow impatient,” said Athos.	475.5013590799052
“Here I am, my friends,” replied D’Artagnan; “not only free, but in	319.6128522253325
favor.”	463.59132094937706
“Tell us about it.”	390.668986837615
“This evening; but for the moment, let us separate.”	458.59574602490136
Accordingly, that same evening D’Artagnan repaired to the quarters of	474.4212210306537
Athos, whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish wine—an	441.5218524128687
occupation which he religiously accomplished every night.	353.3252362707704
D’Artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and	425.6472886785658
himself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, “Here, my	369.5538089734962
dear Athos, this naturally belongs to you.”	413.68154302057764
Athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles.	384.9862948972383
“Friend,” said he, “for Athos this is too much; for the Comte de la	388.46987491285006
Fère it is too little. Keep the commission; it is yours. Alas! you have	330.72585830808896
purchased it dearly enough.”	301.3715064096584
D’Artagnan left Athos’s chamber and went to that of Porthos. He found	440.51388454778197
him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,	430.0647475513169
admiring himself before a glass.	373.65153047193644
“Ah, ah! is that you, dear friend?” exclaimed Porthos. “How do you	426.4425033359996
think these garments fit me?”	388.1636058908716
“Wonderfully,” said D’Artagnan; “but I come to offer you a dress which	335.04404983825975
will become you still better.”	475.5940345092641
“What?” asked Porthos.	463.3503168507914
“That of a lieutenant of Musketeers.”	472.72983470424015
D’Artagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the	391.6894347597032
cardinal, and said, taking the commission from his pocket, “Here, my	336.4460425620836
friend, write your name upon it and become my chief.”	355.60451354701496
Porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to	355.40872436749277
D’Artagnan, to the great astonishment of the young man.	438.4636907879605
“Yes,” said he, “yes, that would flatter me very much; but I should not	334.76529273004047
have time enough to enjoy the distinction. During our expedition to	491.3768044412573
Béthune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the	412.8077909506361
defunct holding out its arms to me, I shall marry the widow. Look here!	380.2591334381845
I was trying on my wedding suit. Keep the lieutenancy, my dear, keep	344.07830389071523
it.”	341.4448097172389
The young man then entered the apartment of Aramis. He found him	392.80087812031064
kneeling before a _priedieu_, with his head leaning on an open prayer	344.78507134476087
book.	340.92925616030004
He described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the	462.6332694228565
third time drawing his commission from his pocket, “You, our friend,	425.9825067267781
our intelligence, our invisible protector, accept this commission. You	462.15704563250677
have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels,	460.71304533046646
always followed by such happy results.”	479.03212084890686
“Alas, dear friend!” said Aramis, “our late adventures have disgusted	438.20993566565147
me with military life. This time my determination is irrevocably taken.	316.97928950403013
After the siege I shall enter the house of the Lazarists. Keep the	308.76269011466127
commission, D’Artagnan; the profession of arms suits you. You will be a	369.3340728614861
brave and adventurous captain.”	321.6843345437405
D’Artagnan, his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy, went	412.7251208449373
back to Athos, whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of	378.0603417897721
his last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp.	323.9996814018274
“Well,” said he, “they likewise have refused me.”	386.39935409320896
“That, dear friend, is because nobody is more worthy than yourself.”	365.0590135618478
He took a quill, wrote the name of D’Artagnan in the commission, and	371.737776315909
returned it to him.	365.09405378723153
“I shall then have no more friends,” said the young man. “Alas! nothing	479.4781661711956
but bitter recollections.”	317.0905340717194
And he let his head sink upon his hands, while two large tears rolled	424.8684079515823
down his cheeks.	461.77321328197775
“You are young,” replied Athos; “and your bitter recollections have	360.3364625543204
time to change themselves into sweet remembrances.”	392.9536184503859
EPILOGUE	304.8105600155139
La Rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the	310.61111381170076
diversion promised by Buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.	327.39517065322315
On the twenty-eighth of October, 1628, the capitulation was signed.	387.2257819467029
The king made his entrance into Paris on the twenty-third of December	398.74118212306183
of the same year. He was received in triumph, as if he came from	299.9510118109261
conquering an enemy and not Frenchmen. He entered by the Faubourg St.	357.1829844620243
Jacques, under verdant arches.	347.55832907431704
D’Artagnan took possession of his command. Porthos left the service,	409.2942189758439
and in the course of the following year married Mme. Coquenard; the	463.9720999659261
coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.	381.73513336508563
Mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of	354.4299084345658
which he had been ambitious all his life—that of standing behind a	330.41541073530635
gilded carriage.	359.07940006549757
Aramis, after a journey into Lorraine, disappeared all at once, and	301.22970105042975
ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through	433.38755929695134
Mme. de Chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,	405.75920016944923
yielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent—only into	296.9023710308932
which, nobody knew.	378.49799041946574
Bazin became a lay brother.	377.6893336855843
Athos remained a Musketeer under the command of D’Artagnan till the	449.40430450132976
year 1633, at which period, after a journey he made to Touraine, he	449.9918676716752
also quit the service, under the pretext of having inherited a small	302.98857422068545
property in Roussillon.	359.6668910718299
Grimaud followed Athos.	455.92046915516676
D’Artagnan fought three times with Rochefort, and wounded him three	355.7359469838463
times.	417.0815486628568
“I shall probably kill you the fourth,” said he to him, holding out his	314.0543113291158
hand to assist him to rise.	487.4324287915011
“It is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are,”	416.9967689532764
answered the wounded man. “_Corbleu!_ I am more your friend than you	424.96887173431514
think—for after our very first encounter, I could by saying a word to	364.41176402857434
the cardinal have had your throat cut!”	365.25806721056296
They this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.	488.5658803818784
Planchet obtained from Rochefort the rank of sergeant in the Piedmont	394.3391403501214
regiment.	450.37373803886993
M. Bonacieux lived on very quietly, wholly ignorant of what had become	301.10827792019364
of his wife, and caring very little about it. One day he had the	459.01580003143965
imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal. The	302.46556496971743
cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he	409.100713479926
should never want for anything in future. In fact, M. Bonacieux, having	455.59286668049566
left his house at seven o’clock in the evening to go to the Louvre,	466.7729162969936
never appeared again in the Rue des Fossoyeurs; the opinion of those	390.274646572553
who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some	331.2907596194916
royal castle, at the expense of his generous Eminence.	385.91037998028753

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation	423.2244536751747
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread	385.35071727956824
public support and donations to carry out its mission of	333.3970717307071
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be	476.1422464708147
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest	413.8439213055822
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations	458.7876736061754
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt	476.9361455351348
status with the IRS.	432.401383185844
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating	445.19723967567495
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United	389.29462605818117
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	327.15025712852406
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	296.36128399863446
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations	420.09117086037463
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND	318.81642339348707
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state	294.77171431973863
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.	420.4219877854092
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we	351.67188251143267
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition	293.96224587188215
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who	361.90687768548344
approach us with offers to donate.	319.3667267283426
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make	318.71720299816855
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from	427.7403553009689
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.	298.0742536016811
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation	470.92569183398234

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works	378.6099855133189
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project	300.51095151717607
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be	461.79821723659245
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and	438.766404140335
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of	482.7780997399647
volunteer support.	461.66095417495893
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed	442.66455892788576
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in	406.103994209406
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not	365.1644781771983
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper	430.85901331954335
