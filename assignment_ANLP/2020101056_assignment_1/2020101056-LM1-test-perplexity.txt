taciturn, this worthy signor. Be it understood we are speaking of	183.70302171308828
Athos. During the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest	214.67932211314513
intimacy with his companions, Porthos and Aramis, they could remember	200.58994641893253
having often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. His words	254.77463421866554
were brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more;	251.2650178485585
no embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. His conversation was a	245.58828244006972
matter of fact, without a single romance.	194.9350787764265
Although Athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal	364.25292146513186
beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a	338.47782469601907
mistress. He never spoke of women. He certainly did not prevent others	333.2875201732925
from speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that	290.37439047554847
this kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and	334.669260786382
misanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. His reserve, his	331.0102924417808
roughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. He had, then,	217.5455911783203
in order not to disturb his habits, accustomed Grimaud to obey him upon	355.5956710119498
a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. He never spoke	265.6056843224353
to him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.	196.55517126976167
Sometimes, Grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while	194.42276637021598
entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration	226.01174241236276
for his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew	303.97969952001796
to execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. Athos	300.54641355669787
then shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,	257.7548600729375
thrashed Grimaud. On these days he spoke a little.	273.9267350929264
Porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of	303.0003022013427
Athos. He not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we	179.02117896535879
must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not.	309.4023941666304
He talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing	266.17016865066876
himself talk. He spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging	201.4230646703535
in this respect the inveterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his	188.82287611884246
childhood. He had not so noble an air as Athos, and the commencement of	238.7876216447185
their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he	279.9790860165253
endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. But with his simple	364.98341143783443
Musketeer’s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back	220.44927673422836
his head and advanced his foot, Athos instantly took the place which	317.03097486723925
was his due and consigned the ostentatious Porthos to the second rank.	228.25518071498217
Porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of M. de Tréville	303.81757079633684
and the guardroom of the Louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,	364.7317468262179
after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from	298.5557911898972
the lawyer’s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less	325.0512044724967
with Porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.	323.21508009607487
An old proverb says, “Like master, like man.” Let us pass, then, from	244.12271715410645
the valet of Athos to the valet of Porthos, from Grimaud to Mousqueton.	336.2876220064679
Mousqueton was a Norman, whose pacific name of Boniface his master had	304.77449407647157
changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of Mousqueton. He had	331.7264975736233
entered the service of Porthos upon condition that he should only be	260.1847457743108
clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two	224.4163235881881
hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would	335.4129650369914
provide for his other wants. Porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing	184.6858733061916
suited him wonderfully well. He had doublets cut out of his old clothes	217.31324127760138
and cast-off cloaks for Mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent	285.6712542948138
tailor, who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and	171.10812287667946
whose wife was suspected of wishing to make Porthos descend from his	324.64162586677753
aristocratic habits, Mousqueton made a very good figure when attending	174.57683825199308
on his master.	265.27119135830145
As for Aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the	342.37868770200544
character—a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be	180.0434044051316
able to follow in its development—his lackey was called Bazin. Thanks	328.8025941583311
to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into	269.92174768373434
orders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of a	202.24906813393943
churchman. He was a Berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,	244.40100185425504
peaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the	225.73518700390824
perusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few	330.77764998932616
dishes, but excellent. For the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and	195.88807821330226
of unimpeachable fidelity.	326.31521854532366
And now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the	181.57120103850394
masters and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by	286.914349678352
each of them.	308.5050852451981
Athos dwelt in the Rue Férou, within two steps of the Luxembourg. His	245.98473784524276
apartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a	328.37138803050686
furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really	209.68440439090932
handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. Some fragments of past	364.7350492949295
splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;	307.55419652579894
a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to	169.81576667908948
the times of Francis I, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with	249.63982895636462
precious stones, might be worth two hundred pistoles, and which,	251.40645849573303
nevertheless, in his moments of greatest distress Athos had never	331.3369044519111
pledged or offered for sale. It had long been an object of ambition for	171.3294980379886
Porthos. Porthos would have given ten years of his life to possess this	309.86862239873244
sword.	305.6292941750953
One day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even	203.4773976831088
to borrow it of Athos. Athos, without saying anything, emptied his	166.51136298353902
pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold	250.77426735333057
chains, and offered them all to Porthos; but as to the sword, he said	232.8027346459145
it was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master	220.63966028242777
should himself quit his lodgings. In addition to the sword, there was a	342.1696458590763
portrait representing a nobleman of the time of Henry III., dressed with	217.70380803152358
the greatest elegance, and who wore the Order of the Holy Ghost; and	190.16267033745632
this portrait had certain resemblances of lines with Athos, certain	170.5863139178819
family likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of	174.40117180622173
the Order of the King, was his ancestor.	307.1354083978015
Besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as	258.70765565068007
the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the	267.4820664616967
mantelpiece, and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. Athos	327.0348252566873
always carried the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened	356.6912856040685
it before Porthos, and Porthos was convinced that this coffer contained	268.48016305108416
nothing but letters and papers—love letters and family papers, no	336.48346266075737
doubt.	330.9641309673269
Porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous	292.10909583248434
appearance, in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier. Every time he passed with a	361.0888095008198
friend before his windows, at one of which Mousqueton was sure to be	219.48538684103985
placed in full livery, Porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,	210.6751611618224
“That is my abode!” But he was never to be found at home; he never	309.7012570302224
invited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of	251.90634148822494
what his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.	323.41673064076144
As to Aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an	311.85575127834215
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were,	275.47596975356396
on the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady	240.81352079143426
and impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.	167.1334279363536
With regard to D’Artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have	238.96059199981016
already made acquaintance with his lackey, Master Planchet.	259.97559560487105
D’Artagnan, who was by nature very curious—as people generally are who	203.17332798568404
possess the genius of intrigue—did all he could to make out who Athos,	168.55447919063366
Porthos, and Aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of	194.8694594239211
these young men concealed his family name)—Athos in particular, who, a	284.84662761904093
league away, savored of nobility. He addressed himself then to Porthos	206.32135487118637
to gain information respecting Athos and Aramis, and to Aramis in order	178.75399755917078
to learn something of Porthos.	176.37945254894214
Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion	296.09063270587325
but what revealed itself. It was said Athos had met with great crosses	208.42009749780038
in love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life	187.49649734105185
of this gallant man. What could this treachery be? All the world was	231.32140882142875
ignorant of it.	186.84550755934984
As to Porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his	283.25619560420597
two comrades), his life was very easily known. Vain and indiscreet, it	212.11986759960362
was as easy to see through him as through a crystal. The only thing to	304.8132391160899
mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things	181.75143183473557
he said of himself.	195.62420804181994
With respect to Aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret	289.36767143536554
about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little	319.6833491603852
to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the	202.66860481079658
report which prevailed concerning the success of the Musketeer with a	238.0457014723179
princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures	290.6288479292541
of his interlocutor. “And you, my dear companion,” said he, “you speak	182.7475850463813
of the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?”	277.96608942839816
“_Pardieu!_ I spoke of them because Porthos talked of them himself,	186.53383539380096
because he had paraded all these fine things before me. But be assured,	338.43293524895716
my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, that if I had obtained them from any other	178.83511330887697
source, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor	349.20033903314356
more discreet than myself.”	207.83727701785088
“Oh, I don’t doubt that,” replied D’Artagnan; “but it seems to me that	212.20364678196134
you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms—a certain embroidered	231.6698728678902
handkerchief, for instance, to which I owe the honor of your	304.95063523891645
acquaintance?”	347.24430706117096
This time Aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and	318.44766882870226
replied in a friendly tone, “My dear friend, do not forget that I wish	329.2106123850515
to belong to the Church, and that I avoid all mundane opportunities.	280.9331944480747
The handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been	309.5402647166027
forgotten and left at my house by one of my friends. I was obliged to	262.2139436496127
pick it up in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. As for	333.31867986535576
myself, I neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in	314.8201923684944
that respect the very judicious example of Athos, who has none any more	365.93550013384186
than I have.”	187.42049708328025
“But what the devil! You are not a priest, you are a Musketeer!”	247.04884667050624
“A Musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a Musketeer	191.73836994531172
against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. Athos and	353.6530298746826
Porthos dragged me into this to occupy me. I had, at the moment of	284.5078224431161
being ordained, a little difficulty with—But that would not interest	317.44325883861796
you, and I am taking up your valuable time.”	220.26291336177133
“Not at all; it interests me very much,” cried D’Artagnan; “and at this	298.08428809439755
moment I have absolutely nothing to do.”	320.27295475507304
“Yes, but I have my breviary to repeat,” answered Aramis; “then some	251.9619680128916
verses to compose, which Madame d’Aiguillon begged of me. Then I must	325.4468195534887
go to the Rue St. Honoré in order to purchase some rouge for Madame de	182.74201313741275
Chevreuse. So you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry,	301.28635699445323
I am very much in a hurry.”	247.8308222780095
Aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion,	242.44222282011526
and took leave of him.	187.59680870699344
Notwithstanding all the pains he took, D’Artagnan was unable to learn	294.2464639349634
any more concerning his three new-made friends. He formed, therefore,	229.92753472964068
the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their	308.57169862765375
past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future.	258.09222907097615
In the meanwhile, he looked upon Athos as an Achilles, Porthos as an	185.07988477160384
Ajax, and Aramis as a Joseph.	231.29632570878357
As to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.	324.6749180201127
Athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. Nevertheless, he never	227.11095424416567
borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their	354.56836322257243
service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his	351.89383869769483
creditor by six o’clock the next morning to pay the debt of the	289.00629246377036
preceding evening.	294.0475671408892
Porthos had his fits. On the days when he won he was insolent and	244.31778358926277
ostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely for several days,	252.72894623517243
after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with	354.1027147492672
money in his purse.	309.200382993509
As to Aramis, he never played. He was the worst Musketeer and the most	323.79436299184147
unconvivial companion imaginable. He had always something or other to	249.8474515006103
do. Sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the	261.18899162389084
attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had	223.7164677422783
two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, Aramis looked	181.06124705611572
at his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company,	322.8752382522557
to go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an	216.6268053721472
appointment. At other times he would return home to write a treatise,	326.9746758903376
and requested his friends not to disturb him.	186.45254497182563
At this Athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which	292.4122667728319
so became his noble countenance, and Porthos would drink, swearing that	234.30794010638832
Aramis would never be anything but a village _curé_.	184.8904409698224
Planchet, D’Artagnan’s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. He	208.30397314494357
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his	171.8314869970071
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. When the	188.34635712578122
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the Rue des	191.46449764774044
Fossoyeurs—that is to say, when the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII.	261.2795254031613
were consumed or nearly so—he commenced complaints which Athos thought	210.80284050771596
nauseous, Porthos indecent, and Aramis ridiculous. Athos counseled	260.8859459094484
D’Artagnan to dismiss the fellow; Porthos was of the opinion that he	242.75741481732334
should give him a good thrashing first; and Aramis contended that a	333.82563559688236
master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.	171.14617032776755
“This is all very easy for you to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “for you,	183.26833108287084
Athos, who live like a dumb man with Grimaud, who forbid him to speak,	252.19434988948603
and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, Porthos,	235.97106976186637
who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your	224.95158683038952
valet, Mousqueton; and for you, Aramis, who, always abstracted by your	271.5555495131118
theological studies, inspire your servant, Bazin, a mild, religious	288.7690467598884
man, with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled	228.55699683455032
means and without resources—for me, who am neither a Musketeer nor even	229.0706642985632
a Guardsman, what am I to do to inspire either the affection, the	333.59397733184926
terror, or the respect in Planchet?”	177.79169151393978
“This is serious,” answered the three friends; “it is a family affair.	262.053720741157
It is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the	268.27076698893757
footing in which you wish them to remain. Reflect upon it.”	185.92471465197815
D’Artagnan did reflect, and resolved to thrash Planchet provisionally;	340.715842463931
which he did with the conscientiousness that D’Artagnan carried into	361.1712184857167
everything. After having well beaten him, he forbade him to leave his	170.2122134354317
service without his permission. “For,” added he, “the future cannot	357.40204072887735
fail to mend; I inevitably look for better times. Your fortune is	345.4883135623967
therefore made if you remain with me, and I am too good a master to	254.66995939633534
allow you to miss such a chance by granting you the dismissal you	239.30940967356784
require.”	261.2097314082907
This manner of acting roused much respect for D’Artagnan’s policy among	167.5242091756025
the Musketeers. Planchet was equally seized with admiration, and said	219.88188957250375
no more about going away.	234.5361658022914
The life of the four young men had become fraternal. D’Artagnan, who	240.9171908027356
had no settled habits of his own, as he came from his province into the	172.6709162607919
midst of a world quite new to him, fell easily into the habits of his	363.45665386771265
friends.	234.57137665262724
They rose about eight o’clock in the winter, about six in summer, and	256.0275770900697
went to take the countersign and see how things went on at M. de	333.81584425749145
Tréville’s. D’Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the	172.66236631798486
duty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he	185.63915047973694
always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was	194.4057038173069
well known at the Hôtel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered	183.48984857675936
him a good comrade. M. de Tréville, who had appreciated him at the	275.5431861246941
first glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased	309.91544210158116
recommending him to the king.	193.10787502513375
On their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young	181.46394753092787
comrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they	302.2037219700518
felt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling,	272.2952461424381
business, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one	294.9070346386655
another like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met	249.3319760791592
with seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice,	181.04090265121107
or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg.	355.43360109500395
In the meanwhile the promises of M. de Tréville went on prosperously.	266.8407758175025
One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit	346.2366552174134
D’Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D’Artagnan, with a	204.538088679659
sigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a	206.23914742592885
Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de	246.41805345597857
Tréville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years—a novitiate	204.75806938348802
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself	296.3348048485982
for D’Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish	275.74022144820856
himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise D’Artagnan	215.078746057818
withdrew, and the next day he began service.	244.05333636711094
Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard	171.30120706863582
with D’Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier	195.79149348171347
Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted	198.34798613212013
D’Artagnan.	177.876368450339
Chapter VIII.	232.60162826308346
CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE	310.2291021759851
In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII., like all other	351.476920739938
things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and	263.39116251854585
after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. At	171.58614837734936
first, Athos supported the association for a time with his own means.	183.50391122275525
Porthos succeeded him; and thanks to one of those disappearances to	293.13000135781385
which he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all	261.1722312407635
for a fortnight. At last it became Aramis’s turn, who performed it with	293.76353841482455
a good grace and who succeeded—as he said, by selling some theological	332.32270504061034
books—in procuring a few pistoles.	221.8877661505789
Then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to M. de	217.63532569092354
Tréville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could	243.66480523486396
not go far with three Musketeers who were already much in arrears and a	185.35911557092328
Guardsman who as yet had no pay at all.	169.36290442951503
At length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they	279.068499869812
got together, as a last effort, eight or ten pistoles, with which	169.12456208084538
Porthos went to the gaming table. Unfortunately he was in a bad vein;	338.0138658886133
he lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given	168.0910969590336
his word.	276.8864520814174
Then the inconvenience became distress. The hungry friends, followed by	242.34158698700685
their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and Guard rooms, picking up	213.01494492044347
among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for	260.61910220849546
according to the advice of Aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right	296.90893291930763
and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.	353.6186262522724
Athos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their	293.247419012255
lackeys with him. Porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same	290.09134178760127
manner that his friends should partake of them; Aramis had eight of	276.6474306858763
them. He was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but	251.97668375284715
little noise, and yet was much sought after.	226.21989739056934
As to D’Artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found	218.32944199075155
one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,	298.6619349992159
and one dinner at the house of a cornet of the Guards. He took his army	301.1608689886811
to the priest’s, where they devoured as much provision as would have	290.1772267144232
lasted him for two months, and to the cornet’s, who performed wonders;	241.29890447943097
but as Planchet said, “People do not eat at once for all time, even	179.74691436363966
when they eat a good deal.”	293.2875746742511
D’Artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one	186.26490297360775
meal and a half for his companions—as the breakfast at the priest’s	342.1706771701065
could only be counted as half a repast—in return for the feasts which	303.0346510543685
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis had procured him. He fancied himself a	271.61685239819934
burden to the society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith	232.15777173922214
that he had fed this society for a month; and he set his mind actively	191.69981362380543
to work. He reflected that this coalition of four young, brave,	215.34585736424623
enterprising, and active men ought to have some other object than	248.83126522906633
swaggering walks, fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less	247.59794987461152
witty.	197.46971786182618
In fact, four men such as they were—four men devoted to one another,	236.3703252864259
from their purses to their lives; four men always supporting one	354.2992973158597
another, never yielding, executing singly or together the resolutions	330.95165751433126
formed in common; four arms threatening the four cardinal points, or	178.81942594489652
turning toward a single point—must inevitably, either subterraneously,	333.6799643496024
in open day, by mining, in the trench, by cunning, or by force, open	317.80132978169513
themselves a way toward the object they wished to attain, however well	239.32998048929346
it might be defended, or however distant it may seem. The only thing	223.68356709502888
that astonished D’Artagnan was that his friends had never thought of	183.20858092071745
this.	231.44092435643995
He was thinking by himself, and even seriously racking his brain to	306.45639396835645
find a direction for this single force four times multiplied, with	354.25429425231613
which he did not doubt, as with the lever for which Archimedes sought,	188.31408889734394
they should succeed in moving the world, when someone tapped gently at	324.31933235966875
his door. D’Artagnan awakened Planchet and ordered him to open it.	286.11401242800804
From this phrase, “D’Artagnan awakened Planchet,” the reader must not	176.51663018924472
suppose it was night, or that day was hardly come. No, it had just	268.26031782656594
struck four. Planchet, two hours before, had asked his master for some	193.75750938508335
dinner, and he had answered him with the proverb, “He who sleeps,	289.87745703541873
dines.” And Planchet dined by sleeping.	280.7868597726188
A man was introduced of simple mien, who had the appearance of a	167.49993190183002
tradesman. Planchet, by way of dessert, would have liked to hear the	236.3544550574175
conversation; but the citizen declared to D’Artagnan that, what he had	348.5405463960501
to say being important and confidential, he desired to be left alone	174.10330984964395
with him.	300.55713668599583
D’Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated.	179.03577119079858
There was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each	223.61320336862593
other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which D’Artagnan	176.57471655426642
bowed, as a sign that he listened.	253.5971294021702
“I have heard Monsieur d’Artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man,”	345.2215754685029
said the citizen; “and this reputation which he justly enjoys had	297.45115644856094
decided me to confide a secret to him.”	206.92063954032525
“Speak, monsieur, speak,” said D’Artagnan, who instinctively scented	265.34412793784315
something advantageous.	239.33031755491373
The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, “I have a wife who is	254.65889711154642
seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either	167.25100201420543
virtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago,	174.52185049726077
although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the	316.8274867771871
queen’s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.”	364.79168092807754
“Well, monsieur?” asked D’Artagnan.	249.9572531024357
“Well!” resumed the citizen, “well, monsieur, my wife was abducted	183.86073771191207
yesterday morning, as she was coming out of her workroom.”	169.66017419010583
“And by whom was your wife abducted?”	231.1523340317321
“I know nothing surely, monsieur, but I suspect someone.”	336.1929049280352
“And who is the person whom you suspect?”	293.34023751373877
“A man who has pursued her a long time.”	317.3770111909764
“The devil!”	192.2782604499735
“But allow me to tell you, monsieur,” continued the citizen, “that I am	251.59132780228657
convinced that there is less love than politics in all this.”	285.24254940273244
“Less love than politics,” replied D’Artagnan, with a reflective air;	220.74576279842046
“and what do you suspect?”	206.9922390617048
“I do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.”	221.8338681404109
“Monsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing. It	320.4823460227561
is you who have come to me. It is you who have told me that you had a	240.78351157138906
secret to confide in me. Act, then, as you think proper; there is still	282.94099885331514
time to withdraw.”	320.5494045043068
“No, monsieur, no; you appear to be an honest young man, and I will	341.9876262844606
have confidence in you. I believe, then, that it is not on account of	233.07494237186904
any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of	330.89510051081083
those of a lady much greater than herself.”	354.9784708385563
“Ah, ah! Can it be on account of the amours of Madame de Bois-Tracy?”	338.633577205391
said D’Artagnan, wishing to have the air, in the eyes of the citizen,	223.60607143401893
of being posted as to court affairs.	313.24594047210144
“Higher, monsieur, higher.”	353.4513999672018
“Of Madame d’Aiguillon?”	305.344480916002
“Still higher.”	318.64240466633674
“Of Madame de Chevreuse?”	188.8358555844281
“Higher, much higher.”	210.12335170581142
“Of the—” D’Artagnan checked himself.	358.98708270018926
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the terrified citizen, in a tone so low that	328.2110158677258
he was scarcely audible.	320.7318650867046
“And with whom?”	208.0073501682928
“With whom can it be, if not the Duke of—”	312.38296486865795
“The Duke of—”	350.8245686506776
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the citizen, giving a still fainter intonation	185.95581404866275
to his voice.	270.56876328772506
“But how do you know all this?”	223.11833961487162
“How do I know it?”	217.720424973713
“Yes, how do you know it? No half-confidence, or—you understand!”	332.10325424049927
“I know it from my wife, monsieur—from my wife herself.”	285.82068392595414
“Who learns it from whom?”	227.32895496176516
“From Monsieur Laporte. Did I not tell you that she was the goddaughter	282.1694456956341
of Monsieur Laporte, the confidential man of the queen? Well, Monsieur	294.52493577776994
Laporte placed her near her Majesty in order that our poor queen might	328.90332047748734
at least have someone in whom she could place confidence, abandoned as	248.17361620321287
she is by the king, watched as she is by the cardinal, betrayed as she	362.3252925882143
is by everybody.”	313.1925507963292
“Ah, ah! It begins to develop itself,” said D’Artagnan.	272.69658906826623
“Now, my wife came home four days ago, monsieur. One of her conditions	339.66761815634874
was that she should come and see me twice a week; for, as I had the	332.3948216573825
honor to tell you, my wife loves me dearly—my wife, then, came and	172.66580847442057
confided to me that the queen at that very moment entertained great	205.87847411018544
fears.”	302.9905305471009
“Truly!”	182.5681742974433
“Yes. The cardinal, as it appears, pursues her and persecutes her more	250.7164474042824
than ever. He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband. You know	349.7218914996181
the history of the Saraband?”	275.1877178960684
“_Pardieu!_ Know it!” replied D’Artagnan, who knew nothing about it,	320.13824171221506
but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on.	304.1650760832929
“So that now it is no longer hatred, but vengeance.”	278.791535267715
“Indeed!”	315.3500782468141
“And the queen believes—”	182.82004848994302
“Well, what does the queen believe?”	297.81179313229484
“She believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her	174.74345790022986
name.”	170.0344773821622
“In the queen’s name?”	189.2455939622206
“Yes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw	365.07802130339905
him into some snare.”	285.65056124266675
“The devil! But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?”	311.1977014366539
“Her devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her	209.53474878436833
from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her	241.3526962274945
Majesty’s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.”	356.38847271215104
“That is likely,” said D’Artagnan; “but the man who has abducted her—do	234.5655895507314
you know him?”	244.02858776979545
“I have told you that I believe I know him.”	247.5742920464494
“His name?”	203.75210660073202
“I do not know that; what I do know is that he is a creature of the	242.4271972404934
cardinal, his evil genius.”	288.3616382847955
“But you have seen him?”	201.69085254520587
“Yes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.”	302.16738855455145
“Has he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?”	256.3517095733325
“Oh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair,	255.23742731495946
swarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his	209.50480098622864
temple.”	362.65378248275977
“A scar on his temple!” cried D’Artagnan; “and with that, white teeth,	279.7586970848526
a piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage—why,	292.61945691261326
that’s my man of Meung.”	360.1015724533303
“He is your man, do you say?”	321.26415489427916
“Yes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it. No, I am wrong. On the	250.10620987156068
contrary, that simplifies the matter greatly. If your man is mine, with	267.6037935327681
one blow I shall obtain two revenges, that’s all; but where to find	189.14430307491472
this man?”	305.01655620649944
“I know not.”	265.8126294126816
“Have you no information as to his abiding place?”	302.86725153314194
“None. One day, as I was conveying my wife back to the Louvre, he was	259.45982566022974
coming out as she was going in, and she showed him to me.”	210.95267014982056
“The devil! The devil!” murmured D’Artagnan; “all this is vague enough.	313.44334851848714
From whom have you learned of the abduction of your wife?”	225.6577002767383
“From Monsieur Laporte.”	196.26907949386143
“Did he give you any details?”	307.1861686891798
“He knew none himself.”	248.65511628151458
“And you have learned nothing from any other quarter?”	213.0918599994363
“Yes, I have received—”	304.644611484964
“What?”	335.38763332504027
“I fear I am committing a great imprudence.”	265.6160431550305
“You always come back to that; but I must make you see this time that	361.94836209669995
it is too late to retreat.”	333.2933732027524
“I do not retreat, _mordieu!_” cried the citizen, swearing in order to	353.5023548101229
rouse his courage. “Besides, by the faith of Bonacieux—”	282.79763693254074
“You call yourself Bonacieux?” interrupted D’Artagnan.	353.2610912089723
“Yes, that is my name.”	341.85356157023676
“You said, then, by the word of Bonacieux. Pardon me for interrupting	343.13839762883435
you, but it appears to me that that name is familiar to me.”	334.6367357197953
“Possibly, monsieur. I am your landlord.”	172.6714683532555
“Ah, ah!” said D’Artagnan, half rising and bowing; “you are my	299.4770977643915
landlord?”	269.0780118478638
“Yes, monsieur, yes. And as it is three months since you have been	259.27990675035744
here, and though, distracted as you must be in your important	345.43701729613895
occupations, you have forgotten to pay me my rent—as, I say, I have not	171.98365875219758
tormented you a single instant, I thought you would appreciate my	320.79598611939866
delicacy.”	316.6763337092193
“How can it be otherwise, my dear Bonacieux?” replied D’Artagnan;	220.47240909820502
“trust me, I am fully grateful for such unparalleled conduct, and if,	220.03893683106656
as I told you, I can be of any service to you—”	360.41930089493417
“I believe you, monsieur, I believe you; and as I was about to say, by	246.08465770907358
the word of Bonacieux, I have confidence in you.”	210.61670185860737
“Finish, then, what you were about to say.”	273.2609800754966
The citizen took a paper from his pocket, and presented it to	288.4163780282656
D’Artagnan.	208.19329511089353
“A letter?” said the young man.	261.90839675528275
“Which I received this morning.”	229.11008685916786
D’Artagnan opened it, and as the day was beginning to decline, he	342.95024386507225
approached the window to read it. The citizen followed him.	212.65264857895505
“‘Do not seek your wife,’” read D’Artagnan; “‘she will be restored to	279.89714944940175
you when there is no longer occasion for her. If you make a single step	332.2791407116662
to find her you are lost.’	253.6110936759162
“That’s pretty positive,” continued D’Artagnan; “but after all, it is	214.09110260245896
but a menace.”	285.6251903808756
“Yes; but that menace terrifies me. I am not a fighting man at all,	196.16917781234787
monsieur, and I am afraid of the Bastille.”	282.9622036963436
“Hum!” said D’Artagnan. “I have no greater regard for the Bastille than	169.4396292613755
you. If it were nothing but a sword thrust, why then—”	324.420031509816
“I have counted upon you on this occasion, monsieur.”	362.5832302698222
“Yes?”	335.9472024810609
“Seeing you constantly surrounded by Musketeers of a very superb	180.56146328607352
appearance, and knowing that these Musketeers belong to Monsieur de	181.8607543158809
Tréville, and were consequently enemies of the cardinal, I thought that	243.7402708589711
you and your friends, while rendering justice to your poor queen, would	206.1935739855727
be pleased to play his Eminence an ill turn.”	288.86692418110124
“Without doubt.”	312.62241482419506
“And then I have thought that considering three months’ lodging, about	319.67001939791436
which I have said nothing—”	311.1120370157878
“Yes, yes; you have already given me that reason, and I find it	206.05562610374216
excellent.”	258.15001477422345
“Reckoning still further, that as long as you do me the honor to remain	203.01423785239868
in my house I shall never speak to you about rent—”	269.89717155551983
“Very kind!”	242.73793401164835
“And adding to this, if there be need of it, meaning to offer you fifty	350.1216049850211
pistoles, if, against all probability, you should be short at the	296.3123008916302
present moment.”	284.1777197757133
“Admirable! You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?”	275.87485927038085
“I am comfortably off, monsieur, that’s all; I have scraped together	362.1308242033298
some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the	340.11820850874136
haberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in	345.08913032842014
the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you	207.71198366897522
understand, monsieur—But!—” cried the citizen.	184.86750379604848
“What!” demanded D’Artagnan.	174.34994931788867
“Whom do I see yonder?”	276.78955377010294
“Where?”	230.03836223798874
“In the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door—a man	249.6875844830568
wrapped in a cloak.”	191.84183323319334
“It is he!” cried D’Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each	349.3127904548751
having recognized his man.	347.9725376649702
“Ah, this time,” cried D’Artagnan, springing to his sword, “this time	341.2924082101657
he will not escape me!”	242.9677377509894
Drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On	226.75626675886713
the staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him.	305.8173464976541
They separated, and D’Artagnan rushed between them like a dart.	261.02985438028463
“Pah! Where are you going?” cried the two Musketeers in a breath.	310.6947354891405
“The man of Meung!” replied D’Artagnan, and disappeared.	206.5464524336254
D’Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with	358.7415822408443
the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to	326.87395859297243
whom this man had confided some important missive.	230.27952078009451
The opinion of Athos was that D’Artagnan had lost his letter in the	237.8775330318319
skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion—and according to D’Artagnan’s	362.7240793050737
portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman—would be incapable of	251.24317457475377
the baseness of stealing a letter.	178.23628179059605
Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to	251.11884969462932
a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the	166.90131847528593
presence of D’Artagnan and his yellow horse.	271.80997295637377
Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was	363.56507665563015
better not to fathom them.	225.02777957691512
They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from	258.41240483887873
D’Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that	326.99496456619806
overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, D’Artagnan would return to	246.77522208999437
his rooms, they kept on their way.	273.68906693716804
When they entered D’Artagnan’s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,	180.43440207675295
dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to	193.045829723748
take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with	264.1423467212702
the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.	232.395904214709
Chapter IX.	257.1926818893311
D’ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF	308.3500582730695
As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,	231.42612594066068
D’Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared	272.7394376993378
as if by enchantment. D’Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all	283.2392781062854
the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he	205.73292211793262
sought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to	296.1064636085073
have begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the	255.5506486308017
stranger had leaned; but this proved useless—for though he knocked ten	197.10052279015508
or twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the	345.88983683208346
neighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to	317.43107904698536
their doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the	338.665223825084
openings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six	355.04167211445554
months.	324.7017065107501
While D’Artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors,	238.30083403565658
Aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home D’Artagnan	324.3257887532192
found the reunion complete.	221.38171136665724
“Well!” cried the three Musketeers all together, on seeing D’Artagnan	205.4354474992411
enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset	348.3366232953864
with anger.	311.8309548068832
“Well!” cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, “this man must be	322.9237310759604
the devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade,	267.0552160063718
like a specter.”	176.52036875630054
“Do you believe in apparitions?” asked Athos of Porthos.	166.56258691137117
“I never believe in anything I have not seen, and as I never have seen	270.3872606425002
apparitions, I don’t believe in them.”	329.5606573541211
“The Bible,” said Aramis, “makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of	313.78889334039764
Samuel appeared to Saul, and it is an article of faith that I should be	232.39403271524296
very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, Porthos.”	263.2392326179503
“At all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this	277.58700901188206
man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a	223.8334948234585
glorious affair, gentlemen—an affair by which there were a hundred	243.51373976423497
pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained.”	211.8794507612899
“How is that?” cried Porthos and Aramis in a breath.	316.0522276047857
As to Athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself	255.04584869276493
with interrogating D’Artagnan by a look.	211.04156786503694
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated	187.75004624184902
his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of	344.5402425143784
the conversation, “go down to my landlord, Monsieur Bonacieux, and ask	291.1310708990215
him to send me half a dozen bottles of Beaugency wine; I prefer that.”	263.0443930495768
“Ah, ah! You have credit with your landlord, then?” asked Porthos.	174.4337500338309
“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan, “from this very day; and mind, if the wine	360.7917928154436
is bad, we will send him to find better.”	273.2652240916228
“We must use, and not abuse,” said Aramis, sententiously.	186.40669811459423
“I always said that D’Artagnan had the longest head of the four,” said	330.849458745583
Athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which D’Artagnan replied	175.64555405878647
with a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.	166.295725078378
“But come, what is this about?” asked Porthos.	263.3661938287094
“Yes,” said Aramis, “impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor	305.9957935532117
of any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do	304.4552879395868
better to keep it to yourself.”	340.436934777608
“Be satisfied,” replied D’Artagnan; “the honor of no one will have	341.91802664508714
cause to complain of what I have to tell.”	328.52713296609716
He then related to his friends, word for word, all that had passed	248.83437862727104
between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of	304.48915624062016
his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at	217.09300057428024
the hostelry of the Jolly Miller.	223.21620847031403
“Your affair is not bad,” said Athos, after having tasted like a	199.26492129602047
connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine	295.4194911981318
good; “and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man.	319.7568595712048
Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty	295.8784317719949
pistoles are worth the risk of four heads.”	194.4390732570792
“But observe,” cried D’Artagnan, “that there is a woman in the affair—a	243.21234832446135
woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured	349.25930235518274
perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress.”	184.05710608480086
“Beware, D’Artagnan, beware,” said Aramis. “You grow a little too warm,	263.84617351380564
in my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux. Woman was created	305.97634248348527
for our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries.”	261.03819556124597
At this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit	188.41253243439968
his lips.	277.72307725095516
“It is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious,” cried D’Artagnan,	279.77663558163493
“but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes,	271.7282787774251
and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other.”	306.7566572545228
“Why does she love what we hate most in the world, the Spaniards and	327.0729953359363
the English?”	252.36619333740128
“Spain is her country,” replied D’Artagnan; “and it is very natural	193.84821283280317
that she should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil	251.2275119628261
as herself. As to the second reproach, I have heard it said that she	283.395160511703
does not love the English, but an Englishman.”	357.1118638144105
“Well, and by my faith,” said Athos, “it must be acknowledged that this	223.33764633621124
Englishman is worthy of being loved. I never saw a man with a nobler	301.1372130814231
air than his.”	275.20092491161336
“Without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can,” said Porthos.	205.41096085811907
“I was at the Louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and,	180.2535186890242
_pardieu_, I picked up two that I sold for ten pistoles each. Do you	328.2944636887736
know him, Aramis?”	175.5794233925794
“As well as you do, gentlemen; for I was among those who seized him in	247.2148287765525
the garden at Amiens, into which Monsieur Putange, the queen’s equerry,	200.7178637660842
introduced me. I was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared	359.33510931458767
to me to be cruel for the king.”	318.4307679488913
“Which would not prevent me,” said D’Artagnan, “if I knew where the	357.48131251883194
Duke of Buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him	202.69795603822553
to the queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find	271.51373091702567
means to play him a sharp turn, I vow that I would voluntarily risk my	180.70904089005717
head in doing it.”	185.1097878215831
“And did the mercer*,” rejoined Athos, “tell you, D’Artagnan, that the	220.51509174930044
queen thought that Buckingham had been brought over by a forged	353.50391730008295
letter?”	211.13833730356268
* Haberdasher	289.8255564671183
“She is afraid so.”	247.53609318478172
“Wait a minute, then,” said Aramis.	223.63306829080574
“What for?” demanded Porthos.	277.2557881636965
“Go on, while I endeavor to recall circumstances.”	298.25680373539126
“And now I am convinced,” said D’Artagnan, “that this abduction of the	337.8198864519595
queen’s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking,	171.82401918457467
and perhaps with the presence of Buckingham in Paris.”	179.5698027386985
“The Gascon is full of ideas,” said Porthos, with admiration.	241.2854238008082
“I like to hear him talk,” said Athos; “his dialect amuses me.”	184.69060967480112
“Gentlemen,” cried Aramis, “listen to this.”	302.79557151189704
“Listen to Aramis,” said his three friends.	297.3708058023701
“Yesterday I was at the house of a doctor of theology, whom I sometimes	197.76993241347793
consult about my studies.”	276.6585733592307
Athos smiled.	214.9420610162595
“He resides in a quiet quarter,” continued Aramis; “his tastes and his	291.64537177120195
profession require it. Now, at the moment when I left his house—”	228.02991257749625
Here Aramis paused.	246.6940662806889
“Well,” cried his auditors; “at the moment you left his house?”	310.3240408451229
Aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the	293.21285719418677
full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen	335.2804266524348
obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,	329.6486772813026
their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.	208.91364035739926
“This doctor has a niece,” continued Aramis.	315.2982128380461
“Ah, he has a niece!” interrupted Porthos.	249.83305882529913
“A very respectable lady,” said Aramis.	361.8857393007755
The three friends burst into laughter.	193.07473898944383
“Ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me,” replied Aramis, “you shall know	236.24391988435497
nothing.”	317.1166883648966
“We believe like Mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones,” said	352.4989869939237
Athos.	172.5807522749642
“I will continue, then,” resumed Aramis. “This niece comes sometimes to	362.90509454865816
see her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that	248.79733972196254
I was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage.”	189.79502764190937
“Ah! She has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?” interrupted	306.6815625048815
Porthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. “A nice	176.03062541273135
acquaintance, my friend!”	316.9080395759401
“Porthos,” replied Aramis, “I have had the occasion to observe to you	294.8018140396298
more than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to	286.3955928416584
you among the women.”	312.8116287164172
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” cried D’Artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of	288.58357356026806
the result of the adventure, “the thing is serious. Let us try not to	189.2323675881545
jest, if we can. Go on Aramis, go on.”	190.41269025460377
“All at once, a tall, dark gentleman—just like yours, D’Artagnan.”	211.95446090265534
“The same, perhaps,” said he.	252.7137287695549
“Possibly,” continued Aramis, “came toward me, accompanied by five or	334.6172230299899
six men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest	297.29491846974787
tone, ‘Monsieur Duke,’ said he to me, ‘and you madame,’ continued he,	256.2647102610189
addressing the lady on my arm—”	365.4485426637646
“The doctor’s niece?”	311.4969243491263
“Hold your tongue, Porthos,” said Athos; “you are insupportable.”	324.5952971801684
“‘—will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least	207.32811359495943
resistance, without making the least noise?’”	178.58242723590607
“He took you for Buckingham!” cried D’Artagnan.	365.05150858087404
“I believe so,” replied Aramis.	212.9138941727512
“But the lady?” asked Porthos.	248.42676321271793
“He took her for the queen!” said D’Artagnan.	244.88333492961897
“Just so,” replied Aramis.	352.8788485576721
“The Gascon is the devil!” cried Athos; “nothing escapes him.”	200.37506194000997
“The fact is,” said Porthos, “Aramis is of the same height, and	283.85591869931045
something of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me	264.0572767506485
that the dress of a Musketeer—”	282.82191614687866
“I wore an enormous cloak,” said Aramis.	225.5673439434645
“In the month of July? The devil!” said Porthos. “Is the doctor afraid	343.2008446032278
that you may be recognized?”	289.0629700320312
“I can comprehend that the spy may have been deceived by the person;	277.0275775511667
but the face—”	289.1396829560184
“I had a large hat,” said Aramis.	261.7205752095143
“Oh, good lord,” cried Porthos, “what precautions for the study of	329.599537326204
theology!”	226.13477079880244
“Gentlemen, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “do not let us lose our time	193.52580372897953
in jesting. Let us separate, and let us seek the mercer’s wife—that is	260.57704945713556
the key of the intrigue.”	342.38039441750533
“A woman of such inferior condition! Can you believe so?” said Porthos,	262.4019073433078
protruding his lips with contempt.	307.7385695520179
“She is goddaughter to Laporte, the confidential valet of the queen.	180.12951934084248
Have I not told you so, gentlemen? Besides, it has perhaps been her	308.80356088884935
Majesty’s calculation to seek on this occasion for support so lowly.	360.29746566625965
High heads expose themselves from afar, and the cardinal is	189.27431642113893
longsighted.”	215.9724090028744
“Well,” said Porthos, “in the first place make a bargain with the	359.1688638643101
mercer, and a good bargain.”	335.88813632899985
“That’s useless,” said D’Artagnan; “for I believe if he does not pay	184.43250589953408
us, we shall be well enough paid by another party.”	233.0730163047685
At this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs;	196.01798080659364
the door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed	311.56407034824133
into the chamber in which the council was held.	315.4353306480429
“Save me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!” cried he. “There	184.4195761462094
are four men come to arrest me. Save me! Save me!”	337.6478552782064
Porthos and Aramis arose.	303.84001761227734
“A moment,” cried D’Artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the	243.49514376474602
scabbard their half-drawn swords. “It is not courage that is needed; it	268.16404599718624
is prudence.”	204.99631379662782
“And yet,” cried Porthos, “we will not leave—”	354.27611377347034
“You will leave D’Artagnan to act as he thinks proper,” said Athos. “He	216.08132243236895
has, I repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part I declare	235.4097174066612
that I will obey him. Do as you think best, D’Artagnan.”	236.9468346009547
At this moment the four Guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,	334.51355659820206
but seeing four Musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,	328.01547373108707
they hesitated about going farther.	287.94043565694096
“Come in, gentlemen, come in,” called D’Artagnan; “you are here in my	322.10501780471316
apartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal.”	290.758914250982
“Then, gentlemen, you will not oppose our executing the orders we have	199.51877993891793
received?” asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.	267.7724799574202
“On the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary.”	299.16225697625754
“What does he say?” grumbled Porthos.	251.38977598747675
“You are a simpleton,” said Athos. “Silence!”	332.01207945449613
“But you promised me—” whispered the poor mercer.	315.57632098118154
“We can only save you by being free ourselves,” replied D’Artagnan, in	217.98380639068358
a rapid, low tone; “and if we appear inclined to defend you, they will	284.033505891995
arrest us with you.”	295.7709879449168
“It seems, nevertheless—”	187.45812863458005
“Come, gentlemen, come!” said D’Artagnan, aloud; “I have no motive for	270.009750007952
defending Monsieur. I saw him today for the first time, and he can tell	167.88714728395232
you on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging. Is that	167.63460047344356
not true, Monsieur Bonacieux? Answer!”	316.96817927307524
“That is the very truth,” cried the mercer; “but Monsieur does not tell	316.6584775212986
you—”	266.3560525142551
“Silence, with respect to me, silence, with respect to my friends;	202.60403304096894
silence about the queen, above all, or you will ruin everybody without	364.6410335488198
saving yourself! Come, come, gentlemen, remove the fellow.” And	332.5607154725098
D’Artagnan pushed the half-stupefied mercer among the Guards, saying to	349.90458336740744
him, “You are a shabby old fellow, my dear. You come to demand money of	332.2981536414718
me—of a Musketeer! To prison with him! Gentlemen, once more, take him	166.79364863057657
to prison, and keep him under key as long as possible; that will give	242.84079788453624
me time to pay him.”	258.1880194284681
The officers were full of thanks, and took away their prey. As they	221.64713083270303
were going down D’Artagnan laid his hand on the shoulder of their	354.74052891907013
leader.	316.7242671046953
“May I not drink to your health, and you to mine?” said D’Artagnan,	365.1138506033168
filling two glasses with the Beaugency wine which he had obtained from	262.4938501725777
the liberality of M. Bonacieux.	338.3846871309966
“That will do me great honor,” said the leader of the posse, “and I	339.37288305617363
accept thankfully.”	232.44214393026704
“Then to yours, monsieur—what is your name?”	308.43659339506485
“Boisrenard.”	347.6506337960386
“Monsieur Boisrenard.”	349.8932602544878
“To yours, my gentlemen! What is your name, in your turn, if you	364.10986578059146
please?”	233.25936890661126
“D’Artagnan.”	336.966207252314
“To yours, monsieur.”	282.139488454419
“And above all others,” cried D’Artagnan, as if carried away by his	314.37378083976773
enthusiasm, “to that of the king and the cardinal.”	297.7370022424501
The leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of	288.88239064699087
D’Artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was	330.27014066435663
convinced.	221.8183515586326
“What diabolical villainy you have performed here,” said Porthos, when	203.05029038068267
the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found	327.0575394728687
themselves alone. “Shame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an	286.80994389837747
unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst!	249.17884216658476
And a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!”	287.28849820281533
“Porthos,” said Aramis, “Athos has already told you that you are a	321.81767796314364
simpleton, and I am quite of his opinion. D’Artagnan, you are a great	274.313094063799
man; and when you occupy Monsieur de Tréville’s place, I will come and	173.10838951416514
ask your influence to secure me an abbey.”	321.0011532839976
“Well, I am in a maze,” said Porthos; “do _you_ approve of what	279.4250681491199
D’Artagnan has done?”	169.4412770166365
“_Parbleu!_ Indeed I do,” said Athos; “I not only approve of what he	292.93185852059355
has done, but I congratulate him upon it.”	352.0916481665409
“And now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, without stopping to explain his	359.66381472635703
conduct to Porthos, “All for one, one for all—that is our motto, is it	346.6875768829969
not?”	314.890931257088
“And yet—” said Porthos.	251.45271465353792
“Hold out your hand and swear!” cried Athos and Aramis at once.	292.64194597932794
Overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos	232.67449920796207
stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice	210.88835082361757
the formula dictated by D’Artagnan:	239.12795335737843
“All for one, one for all.”	293.04396734118797
“That’s well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,” said	184.47184842576434
D’Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; “and	296.06415976453377
attention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.”	283.47361957119557
Chapter X.	246.9470663135916
A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY	345.330963913112
The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as	219.6742119117296
societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police	274.0284166178019
invented mousetraps.	343.7311988819132
As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de	301.73926941749505
Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for	218.9374567240173
the first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a	298.85230750807193
mousetrap.	224.3107607298515
When in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of	206.46470508236396
any crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are	185.64372580414314
placed in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who	218.04386231334394
knock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the	311.01713130765205
end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the	304.5200633014982
_habitués_ of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap.	249.3808794334517
The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever	263.4525945396395
appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal’s people. It	190.28046240426926
must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in	290.113618825902
which D’Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from	360.94003813802345
this detention.	246.93132871461822
Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all	307.08844435326307
been engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered	355.7750863695601
nothing. Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Tréville—a	205.83263829285107
thing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy	205.8964818402291
Musketeer, had very much astonished his captain. But M. de Tréville	282.4130868062374
knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the	175.55502245293064
king, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king	186.0662521395702
uneasy, and the redness of the queen’s eyes donated that she had been	226.12363698619654
sleepless or tearful. But this last circumstance was not striking, as	188.22419277654615
the queen since her marriage had slept badly and wept much.	234.39118756165715
M. de Tréville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant	181.06141499205805
of his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to	199.61463065888177
convey his desires to his comrades.	212.30698540551322
As to D’Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his	274.39339694323974
chamber into an observatory. From his windows he saw all the visitors	287.8372191289268
who were caught. Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and	247.57827973874458
nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room	247.1199213344293
beneath, in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that	248.4887737206271
passed between the inquisitors and the accused.	313.3180045616258
The interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the	292.1351740144229
persons arrested, were almost always framed thus: “Has Madame Bonacieux	216.4531392499033
sent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur	289.8925825936667
Bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person?	251.91266228288407
Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?”	272.0481759227033
“If they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,”	249.47290950556936
said D’Artagnan to himself. “Now, what is it they want to know? Why,	212.81150810073132
they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has	287.58586706597805
had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.”	295.04760183146254
D’Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not	192.04861847661599
wanting in probability.	279.0395452279596
In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise	208.55236141107662
D’Artagnan’s vigilance.	210.44573369030851
On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos	281.23042362026996
had just left D’Artagnan to report at M. de Tréville’s, as nine o’clock	263.1212414450622
had just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was	333.54132469025694
beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door	353.73378976772966
was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.	287.61956803783113
D’Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full	189.58001066707507
length, and listened.	219.72987357823632
Cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be	167.76070971893273
endeavoring to stifle. There were no questions.	234.23543142849462
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan to himself. “It seems like a woman! They	248.9742580410939
search her; she resists; they use force—the scoundrels!”	191.62659394229775
In spite of his prudence, D’Artagnan restrained himself with great	320.6559029695429
difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below.	276.5465203037593
“But I tell you that I am the mistress of the house, gentlemen! I tell	235.56999818408508
you I am Madame Bonacieux; I tell you I belong to the queen!” cried the	187.43683206769262
unfortunate woman.	271.85725607240647
“Madame Bonacieux!” murmured D’Artagnan. “Can I be so lucky as to find	291.2091430173879
what everybody is seeking for?”	272.88790019531984
The voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook	248.5877042827725
the partition. The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four	271.9162450946061
men.	253.68470778956777
“Pardon, gentlemen—par—” murmured the voice, which could now only be	249.20597965076496
heard in inarticulate sounds.	259.41549527574267
“They are binding her; they are going to drag her away,” cried	264.0324988899212
D’Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. “My sword! Good, it	173.33653610576525
is by my side! Planchet!”	329.8464333952912
“Monsieur.”	305.20887771606874
“Run and seek Athos, Porthos and Aramis. One of the three will	338.87243379572146
certainly be at home, perhaps all three. Tell them to take arms, to	166.7363927342868
come here, and to run! Ah, I remember, Athos is at Monsieur de	189.70920560099879
Tréville’s.”	170.11093113859005
“But where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?”	275.28456191691333
“I am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner,” cried	266.4199462582699
D’Artagnan. “You put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the	248.89356840197905
door, and run as I told you.”	219.4949944903038
“Oh, monsieur! Monsieur! You will kill yourself,” cried Planchet.	285.3945157545638
“Hold your tongue, stupid fellow,” said D’Artagnan; and laying hold of	281.60697595845426
the casement, he let himself gently down from the first story, which	324.12071005403817
fortunately was not very elevated, without doing himself the slightest	319.0534762231132
injury.	199.73703563536202
He then went straight to the door and knocked, murmuring, “I will go	333.83924603376124
myself and be caught in the mousetrap, but woe be to the cats that	340.324199660155
shall pounce upon such a mouse!”	263.55379229369555
The knocker had scarcely sounded under the hand of the young man before	340.5959495061153
the tumult ceased, steps approached, the door was opened, and	359.85079659996524
D’Artagnan, sword in hand, rushed into the rooms of M. Bonacieux, the	343.39143807345107
door of which, doubtless acted upon by a spring, closed after him.	245.09072149214617
Then those who dwelt in Bonacieux’s unfortunate house, together with	214.95600055586613
the nearest neighbors, heard loud cries, stamping of feet, clashing of	218.5393550648078
swords, and breaking of furniture. A moment after, those who, surprised	349.86852416326514
by this tumult, had gone to their windows to learn the cause of it, saw	293.793177366643
the door open, and four men, clothed in black, not _come_ out of it,	221.1468957856667
but _fly_, like so many frightened crows, leaving on the ground and on	198.04257244130812
the corners of the furniture, feathers from their wings; that is to	216.67863666731776
say, patches of their clothes and fragments of their cloaks.	235.20803744229318
D’Artagnan was conqueror—without much effort, it must be confessed, for	338.3563248338403
only one of the officers was armed, and even he defended himself for	253.4365007432977
form’s sake. It is true that the three others had endeavored to knock	293.6799378764166
the young man down with chairs, stools, and crockery; but two or three	205.59136772741368
scratches made by the Gascon’s blade terrified them. Ten minutes	167.1782931774053
sufficed for their defeat, and D’Artagnan remained master of the field	274.8403615241434
of battle.	225.98832419833752
The neighbors who had opened their windows, with the coolness peculiar	330.5159693639931
to the inhabitants of Paris in these times of perpetual riots and	236.28215042870147
disturbances, closed them again as soon as they saw the four men in	359.8676096600622
black flee—their instinct telling them that for the time all was over.	296.90780104593773
Besides, it began to grow late, and then, as today, people went to bed	220.7356816303008
early in the quarter of the Luxembourg.	197.84155655411172
On being left alone with Mme. Bonacieux, D’Artagnan turned toward her;	334.8590454193459
the poor woman reclined where she had been left, half-fainting upon an	259.10938624604114
armchair. D’Artagnan examined her with a rapid glance.	224.6689961202478
She was a charming woman of twenty-five or twenty-six years, with dark	311.0611949645514
hair, blue eyes, and a nose slightly turned up, admirable teeth, and a	271.2548716796525
complexion marbled with rose and opal. There, however, ended the signs	220.8597356574626
which might have confounded her with a lady of rank. The hands were	190.1692116575328
white, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of	273.4362975277887
quality. Happily, D’Artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.	218.2735648399121
While D’Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have	300.32027767955225
said, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief,	290.5094385484873
which he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he	316.0395193296522
recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had	240.07804255820503
nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other’s throat.	232.61856175771194
From that time, D’Artagnan had been cautious with respect to	175.02501286152537
handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket	212.64777913497448
of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up.	269.3977980653628
At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her	304.2971862685921
eyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty	255.168051969555
and that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to	251.5729252197542
him with a smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.	254.9904116152002
“Ah, monsieur!” said she, “you have saved me; permit me to thank you.”	270.24116155558653
“Madame,” said D’Artagnan, “I have only done what every gentleman would	205.78621979162747
have done in my place; you owe me no thanks.”	210.77660235521634
“Oh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have	181.52057105398353
not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took	202.81711796854998
for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?”	325.1704949589979
“Madame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have	243.55615528070447
been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband,	245.8681483701545
Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening	282.66303163086025
conducted to the Bastille.”	211.73590762577604
“My husband in the Bastille!” cried Mme. Bonacieux. “Oh, my God! What	262.14542706327546
has he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!”	291.8259393740121
And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features	296.20098856695836
of the young woman.	231.5141355938052
“What has he done, madame?” said D’Artagnan. “I believe that his only	287.4696210779547
crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune	203.13082456987055
to be your husband.”	195.24735506103323
“But, monsieur, you know then—”	279.7939290448878
“I know that you have been abducted, madame.”	329.2219824625172
“And by whom? Do you know him? Oh, if you know him, tell me!”	246.15094543995457
“By a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark	204.8160568000499
complexion, and a scar on his left temple.”	263.6589591349035
“That is he, that is he; but his name?”	344.52702454968954
“Ah, his name? I do not know that.”	282.7501400342908
“And did my husband know I had been carried off?”	261.7038197536426
“He was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor	265.1321327365313
himself.”	167.02358389247755
“And does he suspect,” said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment,	218.84666986491231
“the cause of this event?”	225.22934737639332
“He attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.”	196.1180819075353
“I doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my	235.95594971996144
dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?”	184.54412651240372
“So far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above	207.06308143669042
all, of your love.”	237.97049035000788
A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the	289.2533976822417
pretty young woman.	310.9888767569554
“But,” continued D’Artagnan, “how did you escape?”	238.41955938739085
“I took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had	239.99746171553994
known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the	197.39841899532732
sheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my	238.7013165627715
husband would be at home, I hastened hither.”	289.18287478109335
“To place yourself under his protection?”	245.11904543403483
“Oh, no, poor dear man! I knew very well that he was incapable of	174.1149886223519
defending me; but as he could serve us in other ways, I wished to	167.3682039624234
inform him.”	331.1918960720768
“Of what?”	222.62225148052107
“Oh, that is not my secret; I must not, therefore, tell you.”	223.1812263221167
“Besides,” said D’Artagnan, “pardon me, madame, if, guardsman as I am,	240.1437785295289
I remind you of prudence—besides, I believe we are not here in a very	317.89116817723027
proper place for imparting confidences. The men I have put to flight	228.5711152613521
will return reinforced; if they find us here, we are lost. I have sent	244.27914754606837
for three of my friends, but who knows whether they were at home?”	242.3569569405397
“Yes, yes! You are right,” cried the affrighted Mme. Bonacieux; “let us	300.24454298580343
fly! Let us save ourselves.”	283.0515112192111
At these words she passed her arm under that of D’Artagnan, and urged	259.667165965172
him forward eagerly.	330.7056749365774
“But whither shall we fly—whither escape?”	329.07250765789877
“Let us first withdraw from this house; afterward we shall see.”	250.30653323322406
The young woman and the young man, without taking the trouble to shut	296.10309415916925
the door after them, descended the Rue des Fossoyeurs rapidly, turned	365.3411690224993
into the Rue des Fossés-Monsieur-le-Prince, and did not stop till they	264.560407579187
came to the Place St. Sulpice.	274.1209478423982
“And now what are we to do, and where do you wish me to conduct you?”	312.51947812799165
asked D’Artagnan.	364.931176840866
“I am at quite a loss how to answer you, I admit,” said Mme. Bonacieux.	238.8822080205167
“My intention was to inform Monsieur Laporte, through my husband, in	328.15542818644093
order that Monsieur Laporte might tell us precisely what had taken	211.61202878933773
place at the Louvre in the last three days, and whether there is any	228.89171957598677
danger in presenting myself there.”	244.48781304455798
“But I,” said D’Artagnan, “can go and inform Monsieur Laporte.”	318.2489870004384
“No doubt you could, only there is one misfortune, and that is that	332.1549157013172
Monsieur Bonacieux is known at the Louvre, and would be allowed to	352.16314948299885
pass; whereas you are not known there, and the gate would be closed	240.94975039873518
against you.”	353.31163551830724
“Ah, bah!” said D’Artagnan; “you have at some wicket of the Louvre a	214.90381413646978
_concierge_ who is devoted to you, and who, thanks to a password,	205.25262580782916
would—”	348.0071155974557
Mme. Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man.	193.1453307464526
“And if I give you this password,” said she, “would you forget it as	274.3443918904406
soon as you used it?”	252.79143212413896
“By my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!” said D’Artagnan, with an	222.50413548619758
accent so truthful that no one could mistake it.	308.0584743788992
“Then I believe you. You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your	324.3909791548868
fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness.”	254.0492496577371
“I will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that I can do to	183.39584529324694
serve the king and be agreeable to the queen. Dispose of me, then, as a	315.924981357917
friend.”	352.41081627299764
“But I—where shall I go meanwhile?”	206.9150031702139
“Is there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch	223.61497090398146
you?”	312.0570025560514
“No, I can trust nobody.”	335.67659907245263
“Stop,” said D’Artagnan; “we are near Athos’s door. Yes, here it is.”	192.54027826555156
“Who is this Athos?”	318.78591170963756
“One of my friends.”	236.01156345164028
“But if he should be at home and see me?”	170.2260127547723
“He is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed	323.35286360832606
you in his apartment.”	244.82358404054372
“But if he should return?”	192.04968125836737
“Oh, he won’t return; and if he should, he will be told that I have	173.14014209358092
brought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.”	186.81983263981576
“But that will compromise me sadly, you know.”	223.99419538854875
“Of what consequence? Nobody knows you. Besides, we are in a situation	224.89957322485895
to overlook ceremony.”	340.7847671905636
“Come, then, let us go to your friend’s house. Where does he live?”	311.21391702178397
“Rue Férou, two steps from here.”	359.8349218905922
“Let us go!”	330.285417679337
Both resumed their way. As D’Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not	217.46743677771764
within. He took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the	176.65701621064892
family, ascended the stairs, and introduced Mme. Bonacieux into the	294.0614800161999
little apartment of which we have given a description.	358.80609802352217
“You are at home,” said he. “Remain here, fasten the door inside, and	336.6820303818907
open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this;” and he tapped	194.70492873751542
thrice—two taps close together and pretty hard, the other after an	318.4667825982761
interval, and lighter.	275.88437626585
“That is well,” said Mme. Bonacieux. “Now, in my turn, let me give you	284.5511401011693
my instructions.”	318.88184814326473
“I am all attention.”	246.873576922317
“Present yourself at the wicket of the Louvre, on the side of the Rue	255.9890286775256
de l’Echelle, and ask for Germain.”	252.608331807391
“Well, and then?”	335.98787425845796
“He will ask you what you want, and you will answer by these two words,	357.67306711395076
‘Tours’ and ‘Bruxelles.’ He will at once put himself at your orders.”	303.31670453302866
“And what shall I command him?”	303.0939657601946
“To go and fetch Monsieur Laporte, the queen’s _valet de chambre_.”	295.2494536745328
“And when he shall have informed him, and Monsieur Laporte is come?”	322.7706466784236
“You will send him to me.”	204.92716180362783
“That is well; but where and how shall I see you again?”	294.08105247554136
“Do you wish to see me again?”	242.54139131723701
“Certainly.”	182.44430789700922
“Well, let that care be mine, and be at ease.”	310.9912907942631
“I depend upon your word.”	339.77591562873215
“You may.”	314.44435105091554
D’Artagnan bowed to Mme. Bonacieux, darting at her the most loving	285.36992321372674
glance that he could possibly concentrate upon her charming little	259.3626959892532
person; and while he descended the stairs, he heard the door closed and	350.2111738363621
double-locked. In two bounds he was at the Louvre; as he entered the	246.52034146063522
wicket of L’Echelle, ten o’clock struck. All the events we have	185.6007788561871
described had taken place within a half hour.	323.4052009294422
Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the	269.6228840199474
password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in	313.3367237717117
two words D’Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte	300.6960275718874
assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address,	256.7840076398161
and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he	216.7917063392746
returned.	365.5488937755458
“Young man,” said he to D’Artagnan, “a suggestion.”	220.48740489756446
“What?”	182.2984885965915
“You may get into trouble by what has taken place.”	179.43339026976088
“You believe so?”	315.3709909123237
“Yes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?”	209.03063181936844
“Well?”	229.0998835350628
“Go and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your	271.47893708666805
having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is	248.89739576135457
called an alibi.”	302.77534106951396
D’Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon	332.96799263356945
at M. de Tréville’s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest	173.48870012971437
of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Tréville’s office. As	236.06134103653213
D’Artagnan so constantly frequented the hôtel, no difficulty was made	168.44305267265545
in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de	332.1898825279194
Tréville that his young compatriot, having something important to	319.2032233493375
communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de	309.38119886784847
Tréville was asking D’Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what	209.99796512510875
caused his visit at so late an hour.	178.49578511090078
“Pardon me, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, who had profited by the moment	238.519865026503
he had been left alone to put back M. de Tréville’s clock	357.19146188741206
three-quarters of an hour, “but I thought, as it was yet only	347.2834305291358
twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.”	170.1996061640687
“Twenty-five minutes past nine!” cried M. de Tréville, looking at the	187.67398038769966
clock; “why, that’s impossible!”	311.6156947596792
“Look, rather, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, “the clock shows it.”	204.87209467591774
“That’s true,” said M. de Tréville; “I believed it later. But what can	317.80283421426043
I do for you?”	199.51700999861967
Then D’Artagnan told M. de Tréville a long history about the queen. He	298.72639021393604
expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty;	175.7881741851311
he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal	240.8005366522884
with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of	170.03513448481593
which M. de Tréville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we	243.59326125715552
have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and	333.54127539840727
the queen.	305.7667642356499
As ten o’clock was striking, D’Artagnan left M. de Tréville, who	347.8687252055528
thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of	278.3386187326959
the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at	308.1881335174776
the foot of the stairs, D’Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his	286.97328741834815
cane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a	184.38459405324826
turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be	297.23188901137837
perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from	235.00443823804522
that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs	344.2675565436721
and soon found himself in the street.	326.3648275666051
Chapter XI.	260.35977118329
IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS	285.84303644988375
His visit to M. de Tréville being paid, the pensive D’Artagnan took the	308.4979919990407
longest way homeward.	167.37763645558888
On what was D’Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path,	210.0171473157174
gazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes	200.800727829442
smiling?	210.14513901261896
He was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the	183.96413490331895
young woman was almost an ideal of love. Pretty, mysterious, initiated	193.84055528757267
in almost all the secrets of the court, which reflected such a charming	195.33113237470275
gravity over her pleasing features, it might be surmised that she was	288.3758562101759
not wholly unmoved; and this is an irresistible charm to novices in	314.8368409381751
love. Moreover, D’Artagnan had delivered her from the hands of the	328.8561549608716
demons who wished to search and ill treat her; and this important	337.4400980381283
service had established between them one of those sentiments of	288.72081430032074
gratitude which so easily assume a more tender character.	265.92177683928526
D’Artagnan already fancied himself, so rapid is the flight of our	233.56209475773076
dreams upon the wings of imagination, accosted by a messenger from the	260.02710983653327
young woman, who brought him some billet appointing a meeting, a gold	354.28138097465364
chain, or a diamond. We have observed that young cavaliers received	166.96717089642107
presents from their king without shame. Let us add that in these times	325.4861308098036
of lax morality they had no more delicacy with respect to the	287.4507081487882
mistresses; and that the latter almost always left them valuable and	245.18906185044045
durable remembrances, as if they essayed to conquer the fragility of	321.6127468288931
their sentiments by the solidity of their gifts.	180.11117301217513
Without a blush, men made their way in the world by the means of women	357.40585356195663
blushing. Such as were only beautiful gave their beauty, whence,	295.41736194365274
without doubt, comes the proverb, “The most beautiful girl in the world	230.02091759063057
can only give what she has.” Such as were rich gave in addition a part	212.68590243093897
of their money; and a vast number of heroes of that gallant period may	220.8260886999388
be cited who would neither have won their spurs in the first place, nor	220.3043456231972
their battles afterward, without the purse, more or less furnished,	240.54026180094144
which their mistress fastened to the saddle bow.	245.47194556808654
D’Artagnan owned nothing. Provincial diffidence, that slight varnish,	203.1007730698068
the ephemeral flower, that down of the peach, had evaporated to the	240.92918784819273
winds through the little orthodox counsels which the three Musketeers	193.95337945874348
gave their friend. D’Artagnan, following the strange custom of the	306.5398295914716
times, considered himself at Paris as on a campaign, neither more nor	172.9144508052554
less than if he had been in Flanders—Spain yonder, woman here. In each	289.3036653202898
there was an enemy to contend with, and contributions to be levied.	282.40883925428983
But, we must say, at the present moment D’Artagnan was ruled by a	344.34563374958987
feeling much more noble and disinterested. The mercer had said that he	167.08461554493707
was rich; the young man might easily guess that with so weak a man as	365.7592033404914
M. Bonacieux; and interest was almost foreign to this commencement of	258.39539400322724
love, which had been the consequence of it. We say _almost_, for the	182.0275106518564
idea that a young, handsome, kind, and witty woman is at the same time	237.97858782467534
rich takes nothing from the beginning of love, but on the contrary	358.3907633919165
strengthens it.	339.9515770668808
There are in affluence a crowd of aristocratic cares and caprices which	275.41608890754156
are highly becoming to beauty. A fine and white stocking, a silken	246.93082160092212
robe, a lace kerchief, a pretty slipper on the foot, a tasty ribbon on	247.73634007793547
the head do not make an ugly woman pretty, but they make a pretty woman	174.19056664917903
beautiful, without reckoning the hands, which gain by all this; the	349.2367954553506
hands, among women particularly, to be beautiful must be idle.	348.23871206289255
Then D’Artagnan, as the reader, from whom we have not concealed the	237.70812900818964
state of his fortune, very well knows—D’Artagnan was not a millionaire;	198.0760411136426
he hoped to become one someday, but the time which in his own mind he	289.9877235680704
fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant. In the	204.36042818302855
meanwhile, how disheartening to see the woman one loves long for those	316.0889077214214
thousands of nothings which constitute a woman’s happiness, and be	166.24813856431416
unable to give her those thousands of nothings. At least, when the	255.72568784278013
woman is rich and the lover is not, that which he cannot offer she	257.212415111939
offers to herself; and although it is generally with her husband’s	328.71270989514403
money that she procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it	318.87168759008256
seldom reverts to him.	181.47714716812104
Then D’Artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at	219.64905221965375
the same time a very devoted friend. In the midst of his amorous	238.64352631778897
projects for the mercer’s wife, he did not forget his friends. The	253.15516671751772
pretty Mme. Bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the Plain St.	292.3695343613369
Denis or in the fair of St. Germain, in company with Athos, Porthos,	193.37268912526994
and Aramis, to whom D’Artagnan had often remarked this. Then one could	335.75223070718715
enjoy charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand	361.13196036735906
of a friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. Besides, on	242.9011246984906
pressing occasions, in extreme difficulties, D’Artagnan would become	283.8459299603811
the preserver of his friends.	275.23174159057726
And M. Bonacieux, whom D’Artagnan had pushed into the hands of the	268.62434318105807
officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to	330.3623722362187
save him? We are compelled to admit to our readers that D’Artagnan	257.48668218693206
thought nothing about him in any way; or that if he did think of him,	323.507192855707
it was only to say to himself that he was very well where he was,	211.9810712372676
wherever it might be. Love is the most selfish of all the passions.	293.9421028873865
Let our readers reassure themselves. If D’Artagnan forgets his host, or	186.5777072077758
appears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has	361.64086448140483
been carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. But for	200.96799794009388
the moment, let us do as did the amorous Gascon; we will see after the	260.6859426615244
worthy mercer later.	202.8763164504001
D’Artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the	235.37058783170028
beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the Rue	291.0106690054712
Cherish-Midi, or Chase-Midi, as it was then called. As he found himself	183.63287029590336
in the quarter in which Aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay	177.86706570919088
his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to	330.1366017442516
send Planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the	329.4967107003762
mousetrap. Now, if Aramis had been at home when Planchet came to his	235.65636288056336
abode, he had doubtless hastened to the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and finding	238.44507530056413
nobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be	318.7412108530291
able to conceive what all this meant. This mystery required an	315.325632267252
explanation; at least, so D’Artagnan declared to himself.	243.34218170357093
He likewise thought this was an opportunity for talking about pretty	252.72205152284334
little Mme. Bonacieux, of whom his head, if not his heart, was already	295.2675081712692
full. We must never look for discretion in first love. First love is	324.9059303204152
accompanied by such excessive joy that unless the joy be allowed to	363.6246580320938
overflow, it will stifle you.	277.2849583936379
Paris for two hours past had been dark, and seemed a desert. Eleven	224.28997727300543
o’clock sounded from all the clocks of the Faubourg St. Germain. It was	208.8288444369498
delightful weather. D’Artagnan was passing along a lane on the spot	293.6466839169991
where the Rue d’Assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations	204.7419413604329
which were borne upon the wind from the Rue de Vaugirard, and which	220.30926341292647
arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze	178.4821084486515
of night. From a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good	340.50494485613535
shutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the	287.0763561161535
cabarets scattered along the plain. Arrived at the end of the lane,	235.72163592146575
D’Artagnan turned to the left. The house in which Aramis dwelt was	237.7932608642286
situated between the Rue Cassette and the Rue Servandoni.	260.1943197422252
D’Artagnan had just passed the Rue Cassette, and already perceived the	199.55249156090437
door of his friend’s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis	227.06809705297144
which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived	291.4631583266906
something like a shadow issuing from the Rue Servandoni. This something	170.47550887252254
was enveloped in a cloak, and D’Artagnan at first believed it was a	351.05190973383355
man; but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and	180.72570562819305
the indecision of the step, he soon discovered that it was a woman.	252.58114955498678
Further, this woman, as if not certain of the house she was seeking,	267.31786113402507
lifted up her eyes to look around her, stopped, went backward, and then	275.7795840476585
returned again. D’Artagnan was perplexed.	236.7518496689389
“Shall I go and offer her my services?” thought he. “By her step she	230.26863634773792
must be young; perhaps she is pretty. Oh, yes! But a woman who wanders	174.97017798468627
in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. If I	281.74437877797584
should disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of	265.6891382201777
commencing an acquaintance.”	342.34398683051984
Meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and	358.6379614625281
windows. This was neither long nor difficult. There were but three	186.9949532555534
hôtels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward	282.49473082382934
the road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which Aramis	296.66307156289747
occupied, the other belonging to Aramis himself.	204.9660078829944
“_Pardieu!_” said D’Artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the	357.7157377127255
theologian reverted, “_pardieu_, it would be droll if this belated dove	302.03889863881557
should be in search of our friend’s house. But on my soul, it looks so.	307.05335452791394
Ah, my dear Aramis, this time I shall find you out.” And D’Artagnan,	228.6759090866148
making himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest	207.16910886748065
side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.	356.25837515729154
The young woman continued to advance; and in addition to the lightness	282.23775717814385
of her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which	185.14033058177006
denoted a sweet voice. D’Artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.	240.604833533982
Nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal	344.121604407669
which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether	190.16863921649139
without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her	194.22664879540318
journey, she resolutely drew near to Aramis’s shutter, and tapped, at	247.91128560179192
three equal intervals, with her bent finger.	233.75424488210513
“This is all very fine, dear Aramis,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Ah,	316.6209054677962
Monsieur Hypocrite, I understand how you study theology.”	229.7362473522191
The three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened	258.0852473837962
and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.	237.9888586502746
“Ah, ah!” said the listener, “not through doors, but through windows!	227.161711741619
Ah, this visit was expected. We shall see the windows open, and the	335.4144190340405
lady enter by escalade. Very pretty!”	340.56590157439337
But to the great astonishment of D’Artagnan, the shutter remained	170.1760829960159
closed. Still more, the light which had shone for an instant	181.65865323182243
disappeared, and all was again in obscurity.	260.5737971824508
D’Artagnan thought this could not last long, and continued to look with	339.8140270347284
all his eyes and listen with all his ears.	301.58064937052893
He was right; at the end of some seconds two sharp taps were heard	310.39721423553965
inside. The young woman in the street replied by a single tap, and the	226.353646676412
shutter was opened a little way.	330.495092882667
It may be judged whether D’Artagnan looked or listened with avidity.	343.09194355536
Unfortunately the light had been removed into another chamber; but the	170.62664150651776
eyes of the young man were accustomed to the night. Besides, the eyes	233.3550187537732
of the Gascons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty	166.35477020852446
of seeing in the dark.	222.14729373886445
D’Artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white	169.93601503677095
object, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a	242.36544806246886
handkerchief. She made her interlocutor observe the corner of this	209.2817058804089
unfolded object.	170.04420019270555
This immediately recalled to D’Artagnan’s mind the handkerchief which	343.66733273861405
he had found at the feet of Mme. Bonacieux, which had reminded him of	275.660117410256
that which he had dragged from under the feet of Aramis.	311.65027056070784
“What the devil could that handkerchief signify?”	288.4967304401237
Placed where he was, D’Artagnan could not perceive the face of Aramis.	351.69727110738563
We say Aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was	289.8828919242808
his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of	241.48203688134774
the exterior. Curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the	287.9050490463416
preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have	236.21974287818207
plunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding	363.1310948701641
place, and quick as lightning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran	254.7712637944315
and placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye	353.9755933828431
could pierce the interior of Aramis’s room.	259.70292086381096
Upon gaining this advantage D’Artagnan was near uttering a cry of	297.9118032272744
surprise; it was not Aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal	267.6213285179508
visitor, it was a woman! D’Artagnan, however, could only see enough to	243.30053133206943
recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her	179.17472425677218
features.	274.99809487367685
At the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from	210.5220107141299
her pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her.	175.92568258667518
Then some words were spoken by the two women. At length the shutter	219.77551921978022
closed. The woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed	173.9811054934726
within four steps of D’Artagnan, pulling down the hood of her mantle;	339.36705994890934
but the precaution was too late, D’Artagnan had already recognized Mme.	296.84407003499064
Bonacieux.	361.47156525923515
Mme. Bonacieux! The suspicion that it was she had crossed the mind of	219.60583817282952
D’Artagnan when she drew the handkerchief from her pocket; but what	212.38138727028004
probability was there that Mme. Bonacieux, who had sent for M. Laporte	184.57352256292657
in order to be reconducted to the Louvre, should be running about the	177.80611270248087
streets of Paris at half past eleven at night, at the risk of being	284.4298788835796
abducted a second time?	302.3753711942711
This must be, then, an affair of importance; and what is the most	330.16644645363476
important affair to a woman of twenty-five! Love.	285.42359046864965
But was it on her own account, or on account of another, that she	345.8296283939177
exposed herself to such hazards? This was a question the young man	328.7430769431006
asked himself, whom the demon of jealousy already gnawed, being in	233.8180166939889
heart neither more nor less than an accepted lover.	317.03917731103377
There was a very simple means of satisfying himself whither Mme.	342.3648542525791
Bonacieux was going; that was to follow her. This method was so simple	167.1580379914305
that D’Artagnan employed it quite naturally and instinctively.	212.04690005242077
But at the sight of the young man, who detached himself from the wall	322.8654357084365
like a statue walking from its niche, and at the noise of the steps	205.628035116238
which she heard resound behind her, Mme. Bonacieux uttered a little cry	200.3940002746891
and fled.	216.74115277046138
D’Artagnan ran after her. It was not difficult for him to overtake a	321.3344660198642
woman embarrassed with her cloak. He came up with her before she had	294.5596374264768
traversed a third of the street. The unfortunate woman was exhausted,	214.48615069988034
not by fatigue, but by terror, and when D’Artagnan placed his hand upon	233.56588863584656
her shoulder, she sank upon one knee, crying in a choking voice, “Kill	247.96075962809334
me, if you please, you shall know nothing!”	360.09738742632896
D’Artagnan raised her by passing his arm round her waist; but as he	230.69600532539857
felt by her weight she was on the point of fainting, he made haste to	293.0519267037188
reassure her by protestations of devotedness. These protestations were	243.52893893088384
nothing for Mme. Bonacieux, for such protestations may be made with the	327.3150036226313
worst intentions in the world; but the voice was all. Mme. Bonacieux	309.3921811409732
thought she recognized the sound of that voice; she reopened her eyes,	339.1232647357119
cast a quick glance upon the man who had terrified her so, and at once	272.9726947705716
perceiving it was D’Artagnan, she uttered a cry of joy, “Oh, it is you,	297.16689736995534
it is you! Thank God, thank God!”	247.1359715798385
“Yes, it is I,” said D’Artagnan, “it is I, whom God has sent to watch	230.189166873982
over you.”	177.728782460103
“Was it with that intention you followed me?” asked the young woman,	363.605647136283
with a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its	346.54135123764854
influence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in	299.56172868688805
which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy.	345.88853837677993
“No,” said D’Artagnan; “no, I confess it. It was chance that threw me	365.3077600580277
in your way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my	198.46890187979102
friends.”	190.81868238489264
“One of your friends?” interrupted Mme. Bonacieux.	179.46845327972827
“Without doubt; Aramis is one of my best friends.”	328.49934464512626
“Aramis! Who is he?”	187.45284780086814
“Come, come, you won’t tell me you don’t know Aramis?”	242.51240832425694
“This is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.”	324.85685718817786
“It is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?”	283.21684975706717
“Undoubtedly.”	273.2597535637475
“And you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man?”	307.69815509383716
“No.”	205.71211286712696
“By a Musketeer?”	326.97000052210205
“No, indeed!”	214.12071697080938
“It was not he, then, you came to seek?”	282.72401757598493
“Not the least in the world. Besides, you must have seen that the	175.59746421570233
person to whom I spoke was a woman.”	292.3375379357842
“That is true; but this woman is a friend of Aramis—”	205.54063044558995
“I know nothing of that.”	319.9519130487464
“—since she lodges with him.”	329.7572860386274
“That does not concern me.”	253.9359988101689
“But who is she?”	344.56052713005647
“Oh, that is not my secret.”	245.14575911154458
“My dear Madame Bonacieux, you are charming; but at the same time you	350.7448166306739
are one of the most mysterious women.”	186.14386127707417
“Do I lose by that?”	280.3840710999206
“No; you are, on the contrary, adorable.”	352.8095451786814
“Give me your arm, then.”	287.57245724071277
“Most willingly. And now?”	296.9804992361916
“Now escort me.”	181.19100544613195
“Where?”	302.63929695023796
“Where I am going.”	362.7303799149485
“But where are you going?”	177.87803019394502
“You will see, because you will leave me at the door.”	320.6368967659211
“Shall I wait for you?”	194.2882109679477
“That will be useless.”	213.55239558704426
“You will return alone, then?”	229.55883912313095
“Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”	265.55367849307373
“But will the person who shall accompany you afterward be a man or a	299.05381891441385
woman?”	203.77712231564985
“I don’t know yet.”	181.69639335896994
“But I will know it!”	362.44469740848245
“How so?”	178.898517258236
“I will wait until you come out.”	179.53064776153218
“In that case, adieu.”	357.3988823190586
“Why so?”	227.61673232902237
“I do not want you.”	207.40814425565227
“But you have claimed—”	358.6724762408003
“The aid of a gentleman, not the watchfulness of a spy.”	314.62897268150255
“The word is rather hard.”	243.45028311692954
“How are they called who follow others in spite of them?”	209.11004938990152
“They are indiscreet.”	257.6476708193643
“The word is too mild.”	327.39273192295445
“Well, madame, I perceive I must do as you wish.”	358.6335914189982
“Why did you deprive yourself of the merit of doing so at once?”	200.92023098914729
“Is there no merit in repentance?”	173.842709265214
“And do you really repent?”	274.78878707918
“I know nothing about it myself. But what I know is that I promise to	229.4516106022037
do all you wish if you allow me to accompany you where you are going.”	245.84826922911026
“And you will leave me then?”	338.11883956868223
“Yes.”	246.03987746073796
“Without waiting for my coming out again?”	277.34572393141946
“Yes.”	178.11570624994914
“Word of honor?”	353.6647347491386
“By the faith of a gentleman. Take my arm, and let us go.”	324.86573168726545
D’Artagnan offered his arm to Mme. Bonacieux, who willingly took it,	217.76038936948774
half laughing, half trembling, and both gained the top of Rue de la	278.36094189158325
Harpe. Arriving there, the young woman seemed to hesitate, as she had	350.52608011272525
before done in the Rue Vaugirard. She seemed, however, by certain	188.43840984405813
signs, to recognize a door, and approaching that door, “And now,	324.7707785140851
monsieur,” said she, “it is here I have business; a thousand thanks for	296.78546529418134
your honorable company, which has saved me from all the dangers to	280.43941517369393
which, alone, I was exposed. But the moment is come to keep your word;	324.5122260203177
I have reached my destination.”	232.645683372024
“And you will have nothing to fear on your return?”	274.1656498734895
“I shall have nothing to fear but robbers.”	306.27361276677607
“And that is nothing?”	247.31809191278137
“What could they take from me? I have not a penny about me.”	190.48924732930365
“You forget that beautiful handkerchief with the coat of arms.”	270.4474680287549
“Which?”	337.16532194846616
“That which I found at your feet, and replaced in your pocket.”	283.6682855965049
“Hold your tongue, imprudent man! Do you wish to destroy me?”	332.4249326223221
“You see very plainly that there is still danger for you, since a	360.0576090980081
single word makes you tremble; and you confess that if that word were	279.1555991803848
heard you would be ruined. Come, come, madame!” cried D’Artagnan,	308.98787976413297
seizing her hands, and surveying her with an ardent glance, “come, be	241.02323557329447
more generous. Confide in me. Have you not read in my eyes that there	363.1810375785734
is nothing but devotion and sympathy in my heart?”	245.46218149733724
“Yes,” replied Mme. Bonacieux; “therefore, ask my own secrets, and I	189.5406648305037
will reveal them to you; but those of others—that is quite another	227.72642027773395
thing.”	241.88289613983534
“Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I shall discover them; as these secrets	247.3907721343268
may have an influence over your life, these secrets must become mine.”	221.27858651894695
“Beware of what you do!” cried the young woman, in a manner so serious	246.22089597601763
as to make D’Artagnan start in spite of himself. “Oh, meddle in nothing	302.6942356323217
which concerns me. Do not seek to assist me in that which I am	285.85638037676017
accomplishing. This I ask of you in the name of the interest with which	178.62286492992405
I inspire you, in the name of the service you have rendered me and	174.05368532922478
which I never shall forget while I have life. Rather, place faith in	172.5790848962735
what I tell you. Have no more concern about me; I exist no longer for	335.8105421025597
you, any more than if you had never seen me.”	346.6831890502043
“Must Aramis do as much as I, madame?” said D’Artagnan, deeply piqued.	318.321543925542
“This is the second or third time, monsieur, that you have repeated	238.29634534485425
that name, and yet I have told you that I do not know him.”	295.55154386446077
“You do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked?	234.15078027858573
Indeed, madame, you believe me too credulous!”	201.17772387318263
“Confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this	180.49471081495173
story and create this personage.”	198.2171503518778
“I invent nothing, madame; I create nothing. I only speak that exact	177.48087934572254
truth.”	332.89939859604385
“And you say that one of your friends lives in that house?”	309.1386585907728
“I say so, and I repeat it for the third time; that house is one	362.86181079088703
inhabited by my friend, and that friend is Aramis.”	196.60310520688463
“All this will be cleared up at a later period,” murmured the young	219.19752124874333
woman; “no, monsieur, be silent.”	178.44495404468495
“If you could see my heart,” said D’Artagnan, “you would there read so	188.14590795706155
much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would	283.3192163425465
instantly satisfy my curiosity. We have nothing to fear from those who	335.6984929230671
love us.”	362.71949048589465
“You speak very suddenly of love, monsieur,” said the young woman,	310.46887715352136
shaking her head.	236.81964549481958
“That is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first	308.20645856329077
time; and because I am only twenty.”	293.1114084828691
The young woman looked at him furtively.	197.1928043487268
“Listen; I am already upon the scent,” resumed D’Artagnan. “About three	180.20435206199448
months ago I was near having a duel with Aramis concerning a	233.26643674549754
handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his	272.0045615524159
house—for a handkerchief marked in the same manner, I am sure.”	211.48419387436516
“Monsieur,” said the young woman, “you weary me very much, I assure	195.57951551819167
you, with your questions.”	326.5828809383554
“But you, madame, prudent as you are, think, if you were to be arrested	343.44957422949875
with that handkerchief, and that handkerchief were to be seized, would	330.8336691648492
you not be compromised?”	243.70810218395462
“In what way? The initials are only mine—C. B., Constance Bonacieux.”	301.22926781012364
“Or Camille de Bois-Tracy.”	262.3562090646617
“Silence, monsieur! Once again, silence! Ah, since the dangers I incur	312.26369631934665
on my own account cannot stop you, think of those you may yourself	216.60719249274482
run!”	275.53104639813324
“Me?”	308.59123107237315
“Yes; there is peril of imprisonment, risk of life in knowing me.”	265.52256709801964
“Then I will not leave you.”	216.28515759684777
“Monsieur!” said the young woman, supplicating him and clasping her	270.76507988703713
hands together, “monsieur, in the name of heaven, by the honor of a	166.64912170656453
soldier, by the courtesy of a gentleman, depart! There, there midnight	344.847008421566
sounds! That is the hour when I am expected.”	181.60917776522555
“Madame,” said the young man, bowing; “I can refuse nothing asked of me	290.26640311199833
thus. Be content; I will depart.”	327.90684311405926
“But you will not follow me; you will not watch me?”	257.4732161152036
“I will return home instantly.”	232.33130040407093
“Ah, I was quite sure you were a good and brave young man,” said Mme.	218.5240767308465
Bonacieux, holding out her hand to him, and placing the other upon the	255.52332006966043
knocker of a little door almost hidden in the wall.	203.11935095701932
D’Artagnan seized the hand held out to him, and kissed it ardently.	352.09216896745386
“Ah! I wish I had never seen you!” cried D’Artagnan, with that	213.79008915829158
ingenuous roughness which women often prefer to the affectations of	348.50843677867135
politeness, because it betrays the depths of the thought and proves	364.23155264896815
that feeling prevails over reason.	265.38343926615613
“Well!” resumed Mme. Bonacieux, in a voice almost caressing, and	292.48612543310196
pressing the hand of D’Artagnan, who had not relinquished hers, “well:	290.33356313084033
I will not say as much as you do; what is lost for today may not be	343.3059321351584
lost forever. Who knows, when I shall be at liberty, that I may not	225.4758989461343
satisfy your curiosity?”	341.8525214689793
“And will you make the same promise to my love?” cried D’Artagnan,	364.6190375075355
beside himself with joy.	198.95424969528014
“Oh, as to that, I do not engage myself. That depends upon the	304.72132266641825
sentiments with which you may inspire me.”	257.2799044263746
“Then today, madame—”	298.3757187090988
“Oh, today, I am no further than gratitude.”	177.75089485928683
“Ah! You are too charming,” said D’Artagnan, sorrowfully; “and you	271.6640885912299
abuse my love.”	312.67376072205894
“No, I use your generosity, that’s all. But be of good cheer; with	348.4422873758833
certain people, everything comes round.”	239.03842048209268
“Oh, you render me the happiest of men! Do not forget this evening—do	249.08158113250468
not forget that promise.”	273.33926959796804
“Be satisfied. In the proper time and place I will remember everything.	170.09932814592727
Now then, go, go, in the name of heaven! I was expected at sharp	292.4632709582903
midnight, and I am late.”	298.18732712699136
“By five minutes.”	246.65633872496431
“Yes; but in certain circumstances five minutes are five ages.”	217.98037619211473
“When one loves.”	263.5025445699944
“Well! And who told you I had no affair with a lover?”	326.8559439756253
“It is a man, then, who expects you?” cried D’Artagnan. “A man!”	170.0401025858186
“The discussion is going to begin again!” said Mme. Bonacieux, with a	241.79588897920277
half-smile which was not exempt from a tinge of impatience.	310.2265033511595
“No, no; I go, I depart! I believe in you, and I would have all the	225.39564056503437
merit of my devotion, even if that devotion were stupidity. Adieu,	228.40607964731836
madame, adieu!”	291.39663070059703
And as if he only felt strength to detach himself by a violent effort	195.15976018313407
from the hand he held, he sprang away, running, while Mme. Bonacieux	293.5985391503593
knocked, as at the shutter, three light and regular taps. When he had	352.6785589315433
gained the angle of the street, he turned. The door had been opened,	287.7359270629146
and shut again; the mercer’s pretty wife had disappeared.	295.3903902840764
D’Artagnan pursued his way. He had given his word not to watch Mme.	175.51915430849576
Bonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was	340.38372638706926
going or upon the person who should accompany her, D’Artagnan would	358.5715256170058
have returned home, since he had so promised. Five minutes later he was	215.46480048400218
in the Rue des Fossoyeurs.	279.3503945928612
“Poor Athos!” said he; “he will never guess what all this means. He	308.8665186836478
will have fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned	292.10757752291295
home, where he will have learned that a woman had been there. A woman	251.71960402715362
with Athos! After all,” continued D’Artagnan, “there was certainly one	176.09696684625624
with Aramis. All this is very strange; and I am curious to know how it	218.04212339367982
will end.”	204.22649364706285
“Badly, monsieur, badly!” replied a voice which the young man	201.88635297439052
recognized as that of Planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very	210.878341093816
preoccupied people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which	258.05743741126025
were the stairs which led to his chamber.	222.50836130699372
“How, badly? What do you mean by that, you idiot?” asked D’Artagnan.	317.4410488728709
“What has happened?”	292.1622276301747
“All sorts of misfortunes.”	177.87984169921245
“What?”	262.24033503175013
“In the first place, Monsieur Athos is arrested.”	175.7986483688328
“Arrested! Athos arrested! What for?”	361.44827055550695
“He was found in your lodging; they took him for you.”	303.1765588286088
“And by whom was he arrested?”	314.08824300889114
“By Guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight.”	172.22432575097213
“Why did he not tell them his name? Why did he not tell them he knew	198.85888838699935
nothing about this affair?”	177.2999530834813
“He took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me	332.7807292769237
and said, ‘It is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and	200.67882511994372
not I, since he knows everything and I know nothing. They will believe	325.46068403499305
he is arrested, and that will give him time; in three days I will tell	364.1668988122394
them who I am, and they cannot fail to let me go.’”	263.9285688679156
“Bravo, Athos! Noble heart!” murmured D’Artagnan. “I know him well	204.26347415059686
there! And what did the officers do?”	215.99963443737948
“Four conveyed him away, I don’t know where—to the Bastille or Fort	342.04889028699745
l’Evêque. Two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place	354.69763896518407
and took all the papers. The last two mounted guard at the door during	241.87956559336135
this examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the	207.46721602400788
house empty and exposed.”	168.76287035867242
“And Porthos and Aramis?”	297.8541584070383
“I could not find them; they did not come.”	232.34003192835831
“But they may come any moment, for you left word that I awaited them?”	273.9413238082635
“Yes, monsieur.”	242.28559328569713
“Well, don’t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened.	229.50679998244982
Let them wait for me at the Pomme-de-Pin. Here it would be dangerous;	255.24875807344438
the house may be watched. I will run to Monsieur de Tréville to tell	202.82441201287006
them all this, and will meet them there.”	290.0645799677799
“Very well, monsieur,” said Planchet.	179.02397617702374
“But you will remain; you are not afraid?” said D’Artagnan, coming back	293.0043275545386
to recommend courage to his lackey.	349.8818698250042
“Be easy, monsieur,” said Planchet; “you do not know me yet. I am brave	222.86234278289515
when I set about it. It is all in beginning. Besides, I am a Picard.”	242.93777335287993
“Then it is understood,” said D’Artagnan; “you would rather be killed	281.60217737523976
than desert your post?”	326.88716206999084
“Yes, monsieur; and there is nothing I would not do to prove to	192.48454155504328
Monsieur that I am attached to him.”	225.67050956305474
“Good!” said D’Artagnan to himself. “It appears that the method I have	356.8346027990169
adopted with this boy is decidedly the best. I shall use it again upon	256.44109938881627
occasion.”	252.78187738213586
And with all the swiftness of his legs, already a little fatigued,	187.72608889077324
however, with the perambulations of the day, D’Artagnan directed his	262.5775778434784
course toward M. de Tréville’s.	250.00612337869183
M. de Tréville was not at his hôtel. His company was on guard at the	212.6521197499135
Louvre; he was at the Louvre with his company.	193.03890701044264
It was necessary to reach M. de Tréville; it was important that he	265.51084183521846
should be informed of what was passing. D’Artagnan resolved to try and	281.7725397599369
enter the Louvre. His costume of Guardsman in the company of M.	363.156823773994
Dessessart ought to be his passport.	308.8522107822942
He therefore went down the Rue des Petits Augustins, and came up to the	363.0200085385136
quay, in order to take the New Bridge. He had at first an idea of	221.15628660959084
crossing by the ferry; but on gaining the riverside, he had	343.22404767795354
mechanically put his hand into his pocket, and perceived that he had	226.0639728954042
not wherewithal to pay his passage.	211.4652896461777
As he gained the top of the Rue Guénegaud, he saw two persons coming	271.95419354934114
out of the Rue Dauphine whose appearance very much struck him. Of the	190.71536066779697
two persons who composed this group, one was a man and the other a	344.4186975298159
woman. The woman had the outline of Mme. Bonacieux; the man resembled	205.55054205624683
Aramis so much as to be mistaken for him.	245.57122198823072
Besides, the woman wore that black mantle which D’Artagnan could still	358.60658907447095
see outlined on the shutter of the Rue de Vaugirard and on the door of	335.05192260818086
the Rue de la Harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a	335.7165491594516
Musketeer.	362.18631679480393
The woman’s hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to	238.17511400961203
his face. Both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in	175.55336910100272
not being recognized.	230.02916915255258
They took the bridge. That was D’Artagnan’s road, as he was going to	251.5664823733419
the Louvre. D’Artagnan followed them.	237.42486021958916
He had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman	274.35490257449817
was really Mme. Bonacieux and that the man was Aramis.	182.9753401648851
He felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his	302.54391976716425
heart. He felt himself doubly betrayed, by his friend and by her whom	255.5053107483257
he already loved like a mistress. Mme. Bonacieux had declared to him,	197.9512864793671
by all the gods, that she did not know Aramis; and a quarter of an hour	175.00952540739547
after having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of	232.95787787923524
Aramis.	237.84827137709615
D’Artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercer’s pretty	336.96291003183126
wife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude	216.19910997178084
for having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her	354.15949616965224
off, and that she had promised him nothing. He considered himself an	356.16603118797116
outraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover. Blood and anger mounted to his	220.1637947580853
face; he was resolved to unravel the mystery.	179.85839931239036
The young man and young woman perceived they were watched, and	272.9042001999043
redoubled their speed. D’Artagnan determined upon his course. He passed	280.78260620454967
them, then returned so as to meet them exactly before the Samaritaine,	187.97065336544057
which was illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that	357.0427608245096
part of the bridge.	237.43404280016455
D’Artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.	351.6777785563754
“What do you want, monsieur?” demanded the Musketeer, recoiling a step,	358.55674226782446
and with a foreign accent, which proved to D’Artagnan that he was	257.94548720203977
deceived in one of his conjectures.	190.39667916893015
“It is not Aramis!” cried he.	210.50185087631286
“No, monsieur, it is not Aramis; and by your exclamation I perceive you	288.9470768893049
have mistaken me for another, and pardon you.”	247.27642772518786
“You pardon me?” cried D’Artagnan.	179.07016513497808
“Yes,” replied the stranger. “Allow me, then, to pass on, since it is	181.19897584438897
not with me you have anything to do.”	317.3902944016444
“You are right, monsieur, it is not with you that I have anything to	216.2926024726907
do; it is with Madame.”	307.8788806973224
“With Madame! You do not know her,” replied the stranger.	325.7373039433694
“You are deceived, monsieur; I know her very well.”	214.85860122983462
“Ah,” said Mme. Bonacieux; in a tone of reproach, “ah, monsieur, I had	169.29718297680049
your promise as a soldier and your word as a gentleman. I hoped to be	179.09691750952595
able to rely upon that.”	205.40452015637646
“And I, madame!” said D’Artagnan, embarrassed; “you promised me—”	361.71124561022975
“Take my arm, madame,” said the stranger, “and let us continue our	221.45364876316484
way.”	364.52094992156054
D’Artagnan, however, stupefied, cast down, annihilated by all that	323.1521511804924
happened, stood, with crossed arms, before the Musketeer and Mme.	179.8972029164051
Bonacieux.	322.3399865760912
The Musketeer advanced two steps, and pushed D’Artagnan aside with his	340.25840456486674
hand. D’Artagnan made a spring backward and drew his sword. At the same	332.36053381879697
time, and with the rapidity of lightning, the stranger drew his.	319.6557258547221
“In the name of heaven, my Lord!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, throwing	187.8963647477978
herself between the combatants and seizing the swords with her hands.	248.25241452817812
“My Lord!” cried D’Artagnan, enlightened by a sudden idea, “my Lord!	190.97291901691355
Pardon me, monsieur, but you are not—”	342.85085266099344
“My Lord the Duke of Buckingham,” said Mme. Bonacieux, in an undertone;	179.0500050531414
“and now you may ruin us all.”	312.81436762295493
“My Lord, Madame, I ask a hundred pardons! But I love her, my Lord, and	344.52663141072674
was jealous. You know what it is to love, my Lord. Pardon me, and then	305.33749068664895
tell me how I can risk my life to serve your Grace?”	330.56696245011426
“You are a brave young man,” said Buckingham, holding out his hand to	266.866594655904
D’Artagnan, who pressed it respectfully. “You offer me your services;	332.088456006805
with the same frankness I accept them. Follow us at a distance of	309.2390206392554
twenty paces, as far as the Louvre, and if anyone watches us, slay	294.6944848527597
him!”	276.43974228794315
D’Artagnan placed his naked sword under his arm, allowed the duke and	249.32881386706086
Mme. Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them,	296.3158055465916
ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of	304.95393190982867
Charles I.	227.12906443380245
Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his	325.74692821824834
devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the	189.00798362821848
Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference.	359.76208492142734
As for D’Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the	234.8316278087533
Pomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without	317.1641014492327
giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had	248.859966634052
caused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in	200.42706018927106
which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.	302.3478257160107
Meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our	317.6593495319852
three friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his	348.782686033964
guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre.	224.93207567757054
Chapter XII.	346.4881206932096
GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM	325.3418078552331
Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme.	268.35470687925493
Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform	285.451306205928
of the Musketeers of M. de Tréville, who, as we have said, were that	174.5176649125172
evening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen;	181.16051687885016
and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of	342.9083616883003
having introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the	177.6932431531566
risk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of	186.84660628404805
what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a	232.24899336128098
mercer?	280.2828666681047
Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman	324.53575096328484
followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space	347.1266128939025
passed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants’ door, open by day but	328.4705951455859
generally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found	358.7632287983429
themselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the	173.2096106372122
turnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the	269.65099730746505
people of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke	356.4850476445591
by the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade,	196.53913914184287
put her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase.	289.2072307828638
The duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed	341.772122831885
the course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps	316.10223593555014
farther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the	235.37853457686555
duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, “Remain here, my	198.42662321949587
Lord Duke; someone will come.” She then went out by the same door,	346.64535825570294
which she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner.	288.06358966587476
Nevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of	296.8945945794301
Buckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient	356.47683359553537
points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of	262.9347663131895
romance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he	215.8034205573113
had risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended	326.6052097763942
message from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to	318.21590519884194
Paris, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing	220.01023953662704
the position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he	357.2130762365981
would not depart without seeing her. The queen had at first positively	269.8612730311
refused; but at length became afraid that the duke, if exasperated,	250.05512035978774
would commit some folly. She had already decided upon seeing him and	263.17923866500735
urging his immediate departure, when, on the very evening of coming to	174.12301045645515
this decision, Mme. Bonacieux, who was charged with going to fetch the	316.28036572890807
duke and conducting him to the Louvre, was abducted. For two days no	296.2241357228596
one knew what had become of her, and everything remained in suspense;	310.78230886401366
but once free, and placed in communication with Laporte, matters	269.67318520195454
resumed their course, and she accomplished the perilous enterprise	219.37225275714542
which, but for her arrest, would have been executed three days earlier.	298.25455546420903
Buckingham, left alone, walked toward a mirror. His Musketeer’s uniform	255.04693259756846
became him marvelously.	246.8136864873705
At thirty-five, which was then his age, he passed, with just title, for	287.2904612418847
the handsomest gentleman and the most elegant cavalier of France or	312.749677814813
England.	191.26336676102034
The favorite of two kings, immensely rich, all-powerful in a kingdom	207.47282495239966
which he disordered at his fancy and calmed again at his caprice,	242.29264582681697
George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, had lived one of those fabulous	226.99070562830985
existences which survive, in the course of centuries, to astonish	344.45196345580905
posterity.	359.1368807553613
Sure of himself, convinced of his own power, certain that the laws	328.97424055278077
which rule other men could not reach him, he went straight to the	327.9394703577584
object he aimed at, even were this object so elevated and so dazzling	330.89192205057043
that it would have been madness for any other even to have contemplated	299.15367313694065
it. It was thus he had succeeded in approaching several times the	219.85542362539445
beautiful and proud Anne of Austria, and in making himself loved by	263.28368559552376
dazzling her.	315.7747673858292
George Villiers placed himself before the glass, as we have said,	320.9665172378271
restored the undulations to his beautiful hair, which the weight of his	247.9377752284004
hat had disordered, twisted his mustache, and, his heart swelling with	205.66463283678434
joy, happy and proud at being near the moment he had so long sighed	294.7393509950342
for, he smiled upon himself with pride and hope.	296.5698460927256
At this moment a door concealed in the tapestry opened, and a woman	214.14643173642634
appeared. Buckingham saw this apparition in the glass; he uttered a	249.09078035676146
cry. It was the queen!	338.40394208175326
Anne of Austria was then twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age; that	326.08439181389997
is to say, she was in the full splendor of her beauty.	346.3298872850754
Her carriage was that of a queen or a goddess; her eyes, which cast the	217.56790091731224
brilliancy of emeralds, were perfectly beautiful, and yet were at the	337.6108167217799
same time full of sweetness and majesty.	239.31641716000783
Her mouth was small and rosy; and although her underlip, like that of	213.73607656373838
all princes of the House of Austria, protruded slightly beyond the	356.2424337526374
other, it was eminently lovely in its smile, but as profoundly	174.15163281690727
disdainful in its contempt.	273.4376126732385
Her skin was admired for its velvety softness; her hands and arms were	329.32656300084966
of surpassing beauty, all the poets of the time singing them as	293.9729383542179
incomparable.	336.72117389719006
Lastly, her hair, which, from being light in her youth, had become	213.48773535203028
chestnut, and which she wore curled very plainly, and with much powder,	197.01149166464097
admirably set off her face, in which the most rigid critic could only	195.37293401088218
have desired a little less rouge, and the most fastidious sculptor a	347.74796983589533
little more fineness in the nose.	339.25560187518084
Buckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria	328.7571700631711
appeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fêtes, or carousals, as she	218.57970130560898
appeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white	285.5617570721978
satin, and accompanied by Donna Estafania—the only one of her Spanish	197.0195013062217
women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or	176.91352517055216
by the persecutions of Richelieu.	188.9558105205856
Anne of Austria took two steps forward. Buckingham threw himself at her	226.7610887052356
feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her	339.3406027703527
robe.	184.31228337164376
“Duke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written	196.14976980618655
to.”	324.1674173351694
“Yes, yes, madame! Yes, your Majesty!” cried the duke. “I know that I	195.20634685667096
must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become	262.0357833671517
animated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in	278.9895015562742
love. Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you.”	183.73588073592978
“Yes,” replied Anne, “but you know why and how I see you; because,	252.11435239368816
insensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city	263.7764326493136
where, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run the	342.6872721077991
risk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates	244.28708751244005
us—the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows.	211.12563265770382
It is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short,	284.642764536835
I see you to tell you that we must never see each other again.”	217.19220471876102
“Speak on, madame, speak on, Queen,” said Buckingham; “the sweetness of	313.0233141768008
your voice covers the harshness of your words. You talk of sacrilege!	350.93908897490246
Why, the sacrilege is the separation of two hearts formed by God for	247.04609459597563
each other.”	207.5741968624162
“My Lord,” cried the queen, “you forget that I have never said that I	312.1508627444545
love you.”	181.13696191577924
“But you have never told me that you did not love me; and truly, to	195.7110627300865
speak such words to me would be, on the part of your Majesty, too great	260.85797173036735
an ingratitude. For tell me, where can you find a love like mine—a love	306.3036018874203
which neither time, nor absence, nor despair can extinguish, a love	260.4903309437258
which contents itself with a lost ribbon, a stray look, or a chance	224.26387946230298
word? It is now three years, madame, since I saw you for the first	234.1071405859777
time, and during those three years I have loved you thus. Shall I tell	187.91488217661274
you each ornament of your toilet? Mark! I see you now. You were seated	306.8735957829731
upon cushions in the Spanish fashion; you wore a robe of green satin	303.7706949852257
embroidered with gold and silver, hanging sleeves knotted upon your	258.69051587894955
beautiful arms—those lovely arms—with large diamonds. You wore a close	187.05576480938453
ruff, a small cap upon your head of the same color as your robe, and in	265.4534280418311
that cap a heron’s feather. Hold! Hold! I shut my eyes, and I can see	248.67346895480838
you as you then were; I open them again, and I see what you are now—a	214.24931929544962
hundred times more beautiful!”	257.71940035700345
“What folly,” murmured Anne of Austria, who had not the courage to find	186.5485194374926
fault with the duke for having so well preserved her portrait in his	232.96458375251535
heart, “what folly to feed a useless passion with such remembrances!”	219.26119534169777
“And upon what then must I live? I have nothing but memory. It is my	222.47698340815353
happiness, my treasure, my hope. Every time I see you is a fresh	322.7378275830133
diamond which I enclose in the casket of my heart. This is the fourth	325.77709315788735
which you have let fall and I have picked up; for in three years,	187.8420584781211
madame, I have only seen you four times—the first, which I have	282.89053173411935
described to you; the second, at the mansion of Madame de Chevreuse;	195.94401274966478
the third, in the gardens of Amiens.”	334.13561533334735
“Duke,” said the queen, blushing, “never speak of that evening.”	234.2865954082783
“Oh, let us speak of it; on the contrary, let us speak of it! That is	323.71075039078926
the most happy and brilliant evening of my life! You remember what a	186.36918799501944
beautiful night it was? How soft and perfumed was the air; how lovely	235.04734613226066
the blue heavens and star-enameled sky! Ah, then, madame, I was able	200.59494567729678
for one instant to be alone with you. Then you were about to tell me	325.2708193917914
all—the isolation of your life, the griefs of your heart. You leaned	215.63385459933954
upon my arm—upon this, madame! I felt, in bending my head toward you,	199.26128219228292
your beautiful hair touch my cheek; and every time that it touched me I	260.46748365273027
trembled from head to foot. Oh, Queen! Queen! You do not know what	248.40772271435262
felicity from heaven, what joys from paradise, are comprised in a	347.0658416222898
moment like that. Take my wealth, my fortune, my glory, all the days I	305.29535285100656
have to live, for such an instant, for a night like that. For that	323.16677945160757
night, madame, that night you loved me, I will swear it.”	204.89949935000521
“My Lord, yes; it is possible that the influence of the place, the	194.61511998462439
charm of the beautiful evening, the fascination of your look—the	334.400977524964
thousand circumstances, in short, which sometimes unite to destroy a	329.5338191416026
woman—were grouped around me on that fatal evening; but, my Lord, you	355.70341291949285
saw the queen come to the aid of the woman who faltered. At the first	343.39873586068893
word you dared to utter, at the first freedom to which I had to reply,	251.3739728084595
I called for help.”	265.43561658815895
“Yes, yes, that is true. And any other love but mine would have sunk	273.9067181245379
beneath this ordeal; but my love came out from it more ardent and more	220.5441172700629
eternal. You believed that you would fly from me by returning to Paris;	209.52243876897802
you believed that I would not dare to quit the treasure over which my	210.58719705088401
master had charged me to watch. What to me were all the treasures in	280.20641072943675
the world, or all the kings of the earth! Eight days after, I was back	296.264799298365
again, madame. That time you had nothing to say to me; I had risked my	219.82689914071344
life and favor to see you but for a second. I did not even touch your	341.67023050785804
hand, and you pardoned me on seeing me so submissive and so repentant.”	305.01641994086424
“Yes, but calumny seized upon all those follies in which I took no	331.4277868640104
part, as you well know, my Lord. The king, excited by the cardinal,	330.0301769780341
made a terrible clamor. Madame de Vernet was driven from me, Putange	268.1441129068315
was exiled, Madame de Chevreuse fell into disgrace, and when you wished	230.47404197435287
to come back as ambassador to France, the king himself—remember, my	297.82788046737187
lord—the king himself opposed it.”	224.01567864959358
“Yes, and France is about to pay for her king’s refusal with a war. I	355.4838824088624
am not allowed to see you, madame, but you shall every day hear of me.	296.08596802890827
What object, think you, have this expedition to Ré and this league with	350.69896722471697
the Protestants of La Rochelle which I am projecting? The pleasure of	291.1591833790226
seeing you. I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I	187.57681548005118
know that well. But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will	227.39174054876048
require a negotiator; that negotiator will be me. They will not dare to	329.18487538372096
refuse me then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and	343.3072940322062
will be happy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have	232.30678340564623
to pay for my happiness with their lives; but what is that to me,	266.5505178372293
provided I see you again! All this is perhaps folly—perhaps insanity;	172.7494051307002
but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love; what queen a	238.68957867558692
servant more ardent?”	277.2192424691214
“My Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you	209.32798206580543
more strongly. All these proofs of love which you would give me are	175.293394802947
almost crimes.”	359.9474744484387
“Because you do not love me, madame! If you loved me, you would view	194.68897627240332
all this otherwise. If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be	260.04445681791185
too great happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was	282.0718711091652
less cruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.”	238.08727433720895
“Madame de Chevreuse was not queen,” murmured Anne of Austria,	181.40209389371557
overcome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a	190.7539232938262
passion.	326.25612338623677
“You would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you	246.52150583981785
would love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank	223.65842551677906
alone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been	278.9907814499633
Madame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped. Thanks for those	332.35962621192914
sweet words! Oh, my beautiful sovereign, a hundred times, thanks!”	321.0404962289681
“Oh, my Lord! You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not	178.73437100435325
mean to say—”	286.70820592948985
“Silence, silence!” cried the duke. “If I am happy in an error, do not	343.52412718904486
have the cruelty to lift me from it. You have told me yourself, madame,	299.1088952042106
that I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in	184.647951590623
it—for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a	353.90705178526053
presentiment that I should shortly die.” And the duke smiled, with a	314.4799317297112
smile at once sad and charming.	343.077782236303
“Oh, my God!” cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which	181.74543778038532
proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she	278.0803179276737
ventured to tell.	231.17767992452798
“I do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even	360.2430786954817
ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of	222.34812279813912
such dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have	215.23801002888
almost given me, will have richly paid all—were it my life.”	166.54152685904876
“Oh, but I,” said Anne, “I also, duke, have had presentiments; I also	311.5612840621701
have had dreams. I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded.”	360.05568549808254
“In the left side, was it not, and with a knife?” interrupted	264.3567331413301
Buckingham.	260.60365193912105
“Yes, it was so, my Lord, it was so—in the left side, and with a knife.	302.3187234759367
Who can possibly have told you I had had that dream? I have imparted it	360.08099678691156
to no one but my God, and that in my prayers.”	329.02814614370817
“I ask for no more. You love me, madame; it is enough.”	187.48071137317783
“I love you, I?”	358.9364320027495
“Yes, yes. Would God send the same dreams to you as to me if you did	172.9889533359559
not love me? Should we have the same presentiments if our existences	227.08862591023146
did not touch at the heart? You love me, my beautiful queen, and you	308.6624618927799
will weep for me?”	242.68064408837895
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Anne of Austria, “this is more than I can	274.9134578925647
bear. In the name of heaven, Duke, leave me, go! I do not know whether	322.2512342431478
I love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be	342.26814589838204
perjured. Take pity on me, then, and go! Oh, if you are struck in	352.12879964045715
France, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me	249.5976100492863
was the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run	235.26920117565132
mad. Depart then, depart, I implore you!”	359.6019171899147
“Oh, how beautiful you are thus! Oh, how I love you!” said Buckingham.	182.4664449809898
“Go, go, I implore you, and return hereafter! Come back as ambassador,	166.12081661110912
come back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend	282.61674991511086
you, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer	352.24908647319194
fear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you.”	329.1130713203489
“Oh, is this true what you say?”	225.21386328665665
“Yes.”	331.5163080787454
“Oh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from	275.5332881905246
you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you	289.1304170409099
have worn, and that I may wear in my turn—a ring, a necklace, a chain.”	345.54057084907856
“Will you depart—will you depart, if I give you that you demand?”	318.32333018488674
“Yes.”	296.7491717900812
“This very instant?”	264.8705754584388
“Yes.”	349.06910073460006
“You will leave France, you will return to England?”	207.55909394450762
“I will, I swear to you.”	283.9937816381371
“Wait, then, wait.”	273.3526664039333
Anne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost	302.2382866086873
immediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher	208.03408994840052
encrusted with gold.	185.532438310195
“Here, my Lord, here,” said she, “keep this in memory of me.”	280.57803892939967
Buckingham took the casket, and fell a second time on his knees.	341.2975809534304
“You have promised me to go,” said the queen.	294.123752986441
“And I keep my word. Your hand, madame, your hand, and I depart!”	252.26471502520022
Anne of Austria stretched forth her hand, closing her eyes, and leaning	344.15908340865155
with the other upon Estafania, for she felt that her strength was about	250.6254941718792
to fail her.	330.84732176808353
Buckingham pressed his lips passionately to that beautiful hand, and	199.80839829688722
then rising, said, “Within six months, if I am not dead, I shall have	311.7995736792736
seen you again, madame—even if I have to overturn the world.” And	261.6214001605547
faithful to the promise he had made, he rushed out of the apartment.	275.43165341743816
In the corridor he met Mme. Bonacieux, who waited for him, and who,	277.2077927807238
with the same precautions and the same good luck, conducted him out of	300.34702513852983
the Louvre.	243.95688311478182
Chapter XIII.	204.49739461131782
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX	203.2433968345563
There was in all this, as may have been observed, one personage	365.078333172664
concerned, of whom, notwithstanding his precarious position, we have	324.3268104660589
appeared to take but very little notice. This personage was M.	302.52738720884827
Bonacieux, the respectable martyr of the political and amorous	227.7575450555647
intrigues which entangled themselves so nicely together at this gallant	227.18610538159135
and chivalric period.	358.4922768560682
Fortunately, the reader may remember, or may not remember—fortunately	359.6360816092426
we have promised not to lose sight of him.	289.6161894277149
The officers who arrested him conducted him straight to the Bastille,	274.3716612277542
where he passed trembling before a party of soldiers who were loading	351.49920497590267
their muskets. Thence, introduced into a half-subterranean gallery, he	271.6650912169898
became, on the part of those who had brought him, the object of the	343.37624113444235
grossest insults and the harshest treatment. The officers perceived	324.9897085960961
that they had not to deal with a gentleman, and they treated him like a	230.11216498375092
very peasant.	169.25226965881274
At the end of half an hour or thereabouts, a clerk came to put an end	263.5919934978527
to his tortures, but not to his anxiety, by giving the order to conduct	323.1266336734858
M. Bonacieux to the Chamber of Examination. Ordinarily, prisoners were	360.96139862461666
interrogated in their cells; but they did not do so with M. Bonacieux.	212.90447042004152
Two guards attended the mercer who made him traverse a court and enter	347.29933335170995
a corridor in which were three sentinels, opened a door and pushed him	332.1622474711923
unceremoniously into a low room, where the only furniture was a table,	178.2338647573835
a chair, and a commissary. The commissary was seated in the chair, and	213.28028805141864
was writing at the table.	334.68235079184484
The two guards led the prisoner toward the table, and upon a sign from	193.06112409902022
the commissary drew back so far as to be unable to hear anything.	260.12209643009504
The commissary, who had till this time held his head down over his	298.40148082394774
papers, looked up to see what sort of person he had to do with. This	332.3892882258581
commissary was a man of very repulsive mien, with a pointed nose, with	227.46584697226098
yellow and salient cheek bones, with eyes small but keen and	243.02691487194076
penetrating, and an expression of countenance resembling at once the	220.5572239405832
polecat and the fox. His head, supported by a long and flexible neck,	262.814490633579
issued from his large black robe, balancing itself with a motion very	222.7603982755868
much like that of the tortoise thrusting his head out of his shell. He	256.6110573736271
began by asking M. Bonacieux his name, age, condition, and abode.	216.40967849585792
The accused replied that his name was Jacques Michel Bonacieux, that he	246.97557323956642
was fifty-one years old, a retired mercer, and lived Rue des	342.0975041655506
Fossoyeurs, No. 14.	206.48037465258835
The commissary then, instead of continuing to interrogate him, made him	323.2145474750958
a long speech upon the danger there is for an obscure citizen to meddle	182.9664630820161
with public matters. He complicated this exordium by an exposition in	173.01206264973183
which he painted the power and the deeds of the cardinal, that	214.0101060651291
incomparable minister, that conqueror of past ministers, that example	313.704136419206
for ministers to come—deeds and power which none could thwart with	258.2837692116936
impunity.	300.8373040169295
After this second part of his discourse, fixing his hawk’s eye upon	306.92238776102977
poor Bonacieux, he bade him reflect upon the gravity of his situation.	175.2383702803079
The reflections of the mercer were already made; he cursed the instant	205.10694279305125
when M. Laporte formed the idea of marrying him to his goddaughter, and	344.8234407025255
particularly the moment when that goddaughter had been received as Lady	254.52435241379277
of the Linen to her Majesty.	214.47278248140356
At bottom the character of M. Bonacieux was one of profound selfishness	308.2023036449419
mixed with sordid avarice, the whole seasoned with extreme cowardice.	353.6176237959089
The love with which his young wife had inspired him was a secondary	296.84016478161755
sentiment, and was not strong enough to contend with the primitive	189.6947380370874
feelings we have just enumerated. Bonacieux indeed reflected on what	253.52396594690322
had just been said to him.	253.71182955076574
“But, Monsieur Commissary,” said he, calmly, “believe that I know and	284.4696474819483
appreciate, more than anybody, the merit of the incomparable eminence	260.45258053649326
by whom we have the honor to be governed.”	359.71823253275335
“Indeed?” asked the commissary, with an air of doubt. “If that is	337.87558511921634
really so, how came you in the Bastille?”	167.7896791590737
“How I came there, or rather why I am there,” replied Bonacieux, “that	273.5714039724318
is entirely impossible for me to tell you, because I don’t know myself;	323.91195668524165
but to a certainty it is not for having, knowingly at least, disobliged	174.65782594372044
Monsieur the Cardinal.”	300.33855080171804
“You must, nevertheless, have committed a crime, since you are here and	352.6118998780591
are accused of high treason.”	257.30327723201293
“Of high treason!” cried Bonacieux, terrified; “of high treason! How is	248.75745375861186
it possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors	186.64988350012592
Spaniards, to be accused of high treason? Consider, monsieur, the thing	220.6356214758714
is absolutely impossible.”	289.5012303905495
“Monsieur Bonacieux,” said the commissary, looking at the accused as if	299.8961941529538
his little eyes had the faculty of reading to the very depths of	168.18219682959668
hearts, “you have a wife?”	287.89345498823144
“Yes, monsieur,” replied the mercer, in a tremble, feeling that it was	289.5531387304509
at this point affairs were likely to become perplexing; “that is to	230.37926779794768
say, I _had_ one.”	302.7791041480418
“What, you ‘_had_ one’? What have you done with her, then, if you have	182.37490909264878
her no longer?”	302.9147917122649
“They have abducted her, monsieur.”	277.92710422225366
“They have abducted her? Ah!”	281.29590387366005
Bonacieux inferred from this “Ah” that the affair grew more and more	263.2439281181712
intricate.	305.55623646673143
“They have abducted her,” added the commissary; “and do you know the	181.30190842078903
man who has committed this deed?”	271.9200425813576
“I think I know him.”	310.20994100377254
“Who is he?”	360.2116172765603
“Remember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I	209.22125546881344
only suspect.”	230.70560325750233
“Whom do you suspect? Come, answer freely.”	267.68087802499906
M. Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better	325.82687182656036
deny everything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be	174.6664004819164
suspected that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he	167.10955092555574
might prove his good will. He decided, then, to tell all.	342.89202567253153
“I suspect,” said he, “a tall, dark man, of lofty carriage, who has the	212.620955322001
air of a great lord. He has followed us several times, as I think, when	247.65043818726778
I have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her	214.2572670182109
home.”	218.79824065872242
The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness.	181.0521989047086
“And his name?” said he.	302.8697229264543
“Oh, as to his name, I know nothing about it; but if I were ever to	232.71811719944023
meet him, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it,	256.1972451355699
were he among a thousand persons.”	240.57358272073827
The face of the commissary grew still darker.	274.4619459823772
“You should recognize him among a thousand, say you?” continued he.	292.0794044312122
“That is to say,” cried Bonacieux, who saw he had taken a false step,	340.282395462007
“that is to say—”	262.91900596277674
“You have answered that you should recognize him,” said the commissary.	254.96579488666794
“That is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed	249.6799616396941
further, someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your	306.5034381796598
wife.”	240.129944252522
“But I have not told you that I know him!” cried Bonacieux, in despair.	246.94679756742443
“I told you, on the contrary—”	238.64403531873336
“Take away the prisoner,” said the commissary to the two guards.	174.25088768439878
“Where must we place him?” demanded the chief.	352.895770125043
“In a dungeon.”	217.84622157891027
“Which?”	336.1895574229762
“Good Lord! In the first one handy, provided it is safe,” said the	173.08563616685035
commissary, with an indifference which penetrated poor Bonacieux with	336.92557362979903
horror.	281.0813664415123
“Alas, alas!” said he to himself, “misfortune is over my head; my wife	323.16093243135094
must have committed some frightful crime. They believe me her	203.55543531504722
accomplice, and will punish me with her. She must have spoken; she must	236.238936686915
have confessed everything—a woman is so weak! A dungeon! The first he	274.87794086017175
comes to! That’s it! A night is soon passed; and tomorrow to the wheel,	217.92924735827472
to the gallows! Oh, my God, my God, have pity on me!”	255.009380595216
Without listening the least in the world to the lamentations of M.	195.43796153520236
Bonacieux—lamentations to which, besides, they must have been pretty	212.2633324930377
well accustomed—the two guards took the prisoner each by an arm, and	345.9623889239142
led him away, while the commissary wrote a letter in haste and	275.16381755439295
dispatched it by an officer in waiting.	175.03410562761974
Bonacieux could not close his eyes; not because his dungeon was so very	232.19617092617182
disagreeable, but because his uneasiness was so great. He sat all night	189.6235260661544
on his stool, starting at the least noise; and when the first rays of	314.7121454505771
the sun penetrated into his chamber, the dawn itself appeared to him to	331.04316618586756
have taken funereal tints.	174.1779502006202
All at once he heard his bolts drawn, and made a terrified bound. He	209.11613829687374
believed they were come to conduct him to the scaffold; so that when he	353.2492614531615
saw merely and simply, instead of the executioner he expected, only his	255.52817757249704
commissary of the preceding evening, attended by his clerk, he was	174.90580481227744
ready to embrace them both.	338.76804410257375
“Your affair has become more complicated since yesterday evening, my	175.11448375003414
good man, and I advise you to tell the whole truth; for your repentance	166.7734886568982
alone can remove the anger of the cardinal.”	335.8100664194467
“Why, I am ready to tell everything,” cried Bonacieux, “at least, all	306.005814152221
that I know. Interrogate me, I entreat you!”	168.01285574323745
“Where is your wife, in the first place?”	170.61139773364147
“Why, did not I tell you she had been stolen from me?”	271.086024696247
“Yes, but yesterday at five o’clock in the afternoon, thanks to you,	293.9749489876368
she escaped.”	201.1355556170743
“My wife escaped!” cried Bonacieux. “Oh, unfortunate creature!	262.74404346772974
Monsieur, if she has escaped, it is not my fault, I swear.”	285.8924457528709
“What business had you, then, to go into the chamber of Monsieur	332.2650297337574
d’Artagnan, your neighbor, with whom you had a long conference during	337.8745361875512
the day?”	184.84965987293208
“Ah, yes, Monsieur Commissary; yes, that is true, and I confess that I	283.8310035345205
was in the wrong. I did go to Monsieur d’Artagnan’s.”	343.70681523681776
“What was the aim of that visit?”	253.36483862284814
“To beg him to assist me in finding my wife. I believed I had a right	254.21314975932881
to endeavor to find her. I was deceived, as it appears, and I ask your	343.3711302410505
pardon.”	233.84076190637518
“And what did Monsieur d’Artagnan reply?”	322.9244518888895
“Monsieur d’Artagnan promised me his assistance; but I soon found out	200.96424679611073
that he was betraying me.”	258.6844429935644
“You impose upon justice. Monsieur d’Artagnan made a compact with you;	287.5521490973861
and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested	249.69582604850456
your wife, and has placed her beyond reach.”	260.01938572959006
“M. d’Artagnan has abducted my wife! Come now, what are you telling	308.56140755504003
me?”	210.71300957112183
“Fortunately, Monsieur d’Artagnan is in our hands, and you shall be	200.41779774824522
confronted with him.”	270.5024177311129
“By my faith, I ask no better,” cried Bonacieux; “I shall not be sorry	228.92907435777633
to see the face of an acquaintance.”	288.5469731488799
“Bring in the Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary to the guards.	239.67526376322974
The two guards led in Athos.	299.47641017806995
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the commissary, addressing Athos, “declare	342.48186332842255
all that passed yesterday between you and Monsieur.”	246.66827747969637
“But,” cried Bonacieux, “this is not Monsieur d’Artagnan whom you show	237.7420713696182
me.”	291.3929843630849
“What! Not Monsieur d’Artagnan?” exclaimed the commissary.	255.81602545091152
“Not the least in the world,” replied Bonacieux.	331.44068672646705
“What is this gentleman’s name?” asked the commissary.	302.4376143644605
“I cannot tell you; I don’t know him.”	248.07804957419899
“How! You don’t know him?”	365.69500875503655
“No.”	280.84879448079573
“Did you never see him?”	194.81194999234154
“Yes, I have seen him, but I don’t know what he calls himself.”	210.60076059785357
“Your name?” replied the commissary.	213.54090721075232
“Athos,” replied the Musketeer.	264.08629603388755
“But that is not a man’s name; that is the name of a mountain,” cried	273.89538234048524
the poor questioner, who began to lose his head.	332.6096222111429
“That is my name,” said Athos, quietly.	258.8229211090441
“But you said that your name was D’Artagnan.”	361.20138942418646
“Who, I?”	302.8139064100262
“Yes, you.”	291.2534000604696
“Somebody said to me, ‘You are Monsieur d’Artagnan?’ I answered, ‘You	361.8602679846067
think so?’ My guards exclaimed that they were sure of it. I did not	214.64091974711897
wish to contradict them; besides, I might be deceived.”	316.2215160500997
“Monsieur, you insult the majesty of justice.”	287.62691898192236
“Not at all,” said Athos, calmly.	250.57527443597178
“You are Monsieur d’Artagnan.”	175.8312911882619
“You see, monsieur, that you say it again.”	184.47570892650367
“But I tell you, Monsieur Commissary,” cried Bonacieux, in his turn,	286.93961944509033
“there is not the least doubt about the matter. Monsieur d’Artagnan is	260.6782447573637
my tenant, although he does not pay me my rent—and even better on that	279.1884190687579
account ought I to know him. Monsieur d’Artagnan is a young man,	224.96964883671032
scarcely nineteen or twenty, and this gentleman must be thirty at	195.71404333458722
least. Monsieur d’Artagnan is in Monsieur Dessessart’s Guards, and this	237.87610605748807
gentleman is in the company of Monsieur de Tréville’s Musketeers. Look	233.56879379765098
at his uniform, Monsieur Commissary, look at his uniform!”	191.14618403964425
“That’s true,” murmured the commissary; “_pardieu_, that’s true.”	247.66954911889815
At this moment the door was opened quickly, and a messenger, introduced	308.5870974501228
by one of the gatekeepers of the Bastille, gave a letter to the	228.70139481068736
commissary.	168.23407804734757
“Oh, unhappy woman!” cried the commissary.	214.39765773580302
“How? What do you say? Of whom do you speak? It is not of my wife, I	167.92401232837656
hope!”	354.4895000451713
“On the contrary, it is of her. Yours is a pretty business.”	225.3414723909757
“But,” said the agitated mercer, “do me the pleasure, monsieur, to tell	220.9521262099079
me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does	361.9671642717765
while I am in prison?”	365.7092556080647
“Because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you—of	235.53970044520406
an infernal plan.”	301.2968548764306
“I swear to you, Monsieur Commissary, that you are in the profoundest	302.1390476530539
error, that I know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do,	190.16760296937372
that I am entirely a stranger to what she has done; and that if she has	208.85473368744596
committed any follies, I renounce her, I abjure her, I curse her!”	259.8947816133268
“Bah!” said Athos to the commissary, “if you have no more need of me,	310.63578527916894
send me somewhere. Your Monsieur Bonacieux is very tiresome.”	225.8052001211943
The commissary designated by the same gesture Athos and Bonacieux, “Let	226.52384910196992
them be guarded more closely than ever.”	231.6570744654454
“And yet,” said Athos, with his habitual calmness, “if it be Monsieur	240.35912233340804
d’Artagnan who is concerned in this matter, I do not perceive how I can	258.6124069715932
take his place.”	183.8983569080652
“Do as I bade you,” cried the commissary, “and preserve absolute	303.0807431413919
secrecy. You understand!”	290.83329371019107
Athos shrugged his shoulders, and followed his guards silently, while	307.1974919137437
M. Bonacieux uttered lamentations enough to break the heart of a tiger.	197.30712730639445
They locked the mercer in the same dungeon where he had passed the	219.64606768335906
night, and left him to himself during the day. Bonacieux wept all day,	342.45340806746844
like a true mercer, not being at all a military man, as he himself	261.8527116086486
informed us. In the evening, about nine o’clock, at the moment he had	230.10351008178128
made up his mind to go to bed, he heard steps in his corridor. These	285.12662016386236
steps drew near to his dungeon, the door was thrown open, and the	190.0902396215444
guards appeared.	299.28218943243223
“Follow me,” said an officer, who came up behind the guards.	289.4681810715975
“Follow you!” cried Bonacieux, “follow you at this hour! Where, my	363.49376460742536
God?”	211.97971106722707
“Where we have orders to lead you.”	194.22507748390956
“But that is not an answer.”	284.8581344656279
“It is, nevertheless, the only one we can give.”	359.0377685801925
“Ah, my God, my God!” murmured the poor mercer, “now, indeed, I am	241.48706604606568
lost!” And he followed the guards who came for him, mechanically and	175.81886937358087
without resistance.	320.1395689274161
He passed along the same corridor as before, crossed one court, then a	326.6273682156773
second side of a building; at length, at the gate of the entrance court	318.77327343612023
he found a carriage surrounded by four guards on horseback. They made	343.92289664789854
him enter this carriage, the officer placed himself by his side, the	258.4861848308533
door was locked, and they were left in a rolling prison. The carriage	258.930685069149
was put in motion as slowly as a funeral car. Through the closely	344.8562215502494
fastened windows the prisoner could perceive the houses and the	355.49239090918775
pavement, that was all; but, true Parisian as he was, Bonacieux could	302.3830907474886
recognize every street by the milestones, the signs, and the lamps. At	183.0494985142832
the moment of arriving at St. Paul—the spot where such as were	247.31541147955951
condemned at the Bastille were executed—he was near fainting and	275.77233591767026
crossed himself twice. He thought the carriage was about to stop there.	285.42503739371807
The carriage, however, passed on.	356.56593459753594
Farther on, a still greater terror seized him on passing by the	343.9508007054218
cemetery of St. Jean, where state criminals were buried. One thing,	193.47374946730875
however, reassured him; he remembered that before they were buried	208.3500539269213
their heads were generally cut off, and he felt that his head was still	327.406607550592
on his shoulders. But when he saw the carriage take the way to La	194.84831308843889
Grêve, when he perceived the pointed roof of the Hôtel de Ville, and	270.76628842567266
the carriage passed under the arcade, he believed it was over with him.	318.3741799056686
He wished to confess to the officer, and upon his refusal, uttered such	350.7472296187299
pitiable cries that the officer told him that if he continued to deafen	320.20786881204526
him thus, he should put a gag in his mouth.	319.8552946116652
This measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux. If they meant to execute him	334.4205937911483
at La Grêve, it could scarcely be worth while to gag him, as they had	180.43867498974365
nearly reached the place of execution. Indeed, the carriage crossed the	364.5816299662964
fatal spot without stopping. There remained, then, no other place to	166.52636894077577
fear but the Traitor’s Cross; the carriage was taking the direct road	350.5228992839387
to it.	199.06789346152485
This time there was no longer any doubt; it was at the Traitor’s Cross	168.4424098484327
that lesser criminals were executed. Bonacieux had flattered himself in	333.32104303811246
believing himself worthy of St. Paul or of the Place de Grêve; it was	226.60263269398374
at the Traitor’s Cross that his journey and his destiny were about to	180.50964273606309
end! He could not yet see that dreadful cross, but he felt somehow as	213.02188716687766
if it were coming to meet him. When he was within twenty paces of it,	279.5174669131306
he heard a noise of people and the carriage stopped. This was more than	221.6511388176552
poor Bonacieux could endure, depressed as he was by the successive	168.95548428492097
emotions which he had experienced; he uttered a feeble groan which	193.430736796266
might have been taken for the last sigh of a dying man, and fainted.	277.48087639667733
Chapter XIV.	276.1532515544932
THE MAN OF MEUNG	250.75659370791485
The crowd was caused, not by the expectation of a man to be hanged, but	354.49875017763816
by the contemplation of a man who was hanged.	191.30760580340524
The carriage, which had been stopped for a minute, resumed its way,	272.7459088962173
passed through the crowd, threaded the Rue St. Honoré, turned into the	272.77067850436896
Rue des Bons Enfants, and stopped before a low door.	241.35442165152384
The door opened; two guards received Bonacieux in their arms from the	197.6462718112935
officer who supported him. They carried him through an alley, up a	252.34888448616098
flight of stairs, and deposited him in an antechamber.	227.8732636544513
All these movements had been effected mechanically, as far as he was	207.7427775771781
concerned. He had walked as one walks in a dream; he had a glimpse of	266.6894702773924
objects as through a fog. His ears had perceived sounds without	350.3941052460906
comprehending them; he might have been executed at that moment without	177.22386530885458
his making a single gesture in his own defense or uttering a cry to	293.22601655976143
implore mercy.	337.8395682112151
He remained on the bench, with his back leaning against the wall and	307.58494419909493
his hands hanging down, exactly on the spot where the guards placed	202.40705111181128
him.	167.1241477911123
On looking around him, however, as he could perceive no threatening	213.50687467906232
object, as nothing indicated that he ran any real danger, as the bench	293.2503846462929
was comfortably covered with a well-stuffed cushion, as the wall was	210.66588590469345
ornamented with a beautiful Cordova leather, and as large red damask	203.35022875232957
curtains, fastened back by gold clasps, floated before the window, he	220.72372110892746
perceived by degrees that his fear was exaggerated, and he began to	284.9385217907088
turn his head to the right and the left, upward and downward.	213.63985296564815
At this movement, which nobody opposed, he resumed a little courage,	297.4420243646649
and ventured to draw up one leg and then the other. At length, with the	235.4406220908886
help of his two hands he lifted himself from the bench, and found	316.97649051342637
himself on his feet.	342.2133006891346
At this moment an officer with a pleasant face opened a door, continued	284.64267700569695
to exchange some words with a person in the next chamber and then came	242.28553979004008
up to the prisoner. “Is your name Bonacieux?” said he.	204.43501062593663
“Yes, Monsieur Officer,” stammered the mercer, more dead than alive,	346.8476922671583
“at your service.”	301.23426270885193
“Come in,” said the officer.	274.92194317618254
And he moved out of the way to let the mercer pass. The latter obeyed	219.7204929164591
without reply, and entered the chamber, where he appeared to be	260.7398558379251
expected.	218.3040741095566
It was a large cabinet, close and stifling, with the walls furnished	243.38426055374077
with arms offensive and defensive, and in which there was already a	314.1097441185156
fire, although it was scarcely the end of the month of September. A	300.98930044643134
square table, covered with books and papers, upon which was unrolled an	307.8777541365978
immense plan of the city of La Rochelle, occupied the center of the	308.2664446764896
room.	319.99988735050596
Standing before the chimney was a man of middle height, of a haughty,	268.11197705363304
proud mien; with piercing eyes, a large brow, and a thin face, which	178.94197080371634
was made still longer by a _royal_ (or _imperial_, as it is now	192.227684323267
called), surmounted by a pair of mustaches. Although this man was	358.90390454714236
scarcely thirty-six or thirty-seven years of age, hair, mustaches, and	210.72076364471326
royal, all began to be gray. This man, except a sword, had all the	206.89532376453946
appearance of a soldier; and his buff boots, still slightly covered	263.37345238649874
with dust, indicated that he had been on horseback in the course of the	252.35758025288908
day.	221.94378608330874
This man was Armand Jean Duplessis, Cardinal de Richelieu; not such as	297.14032147651227
he is now represented—broken down like an old man, suffering like a	218.54786386109095
martyr, his body bent, his voice failing, buried in a large armchair as	190.043760936185
in an anticipated tomb; no longer living but by the strength of his	360.23132948182797
genius, and no longer maintaining the struggle with Europe but by the	202.23200276814845
eternal application of his thoughts—but such as he really was at this	244.63339380788597
period; that is to say, an active and gallant cavalier, already weak of	324.6674544979314
body, but sustained by that moral power which made of him one of the	259.2366949765611
most extraordinary men that ever lived, preparing, after having	308.46278288468704
supported the Duc de Nevers in his duchy of Mantua, after having taken	304.12284722356924
Nîmes, Castres, and Uzes, to drive the English from the Isle of Ré and	330.2628615418806
lay siege to La Rochelle.	231.28620297968698
At first sight, nothing denoted the cardinal; and it was impossible for	217.19879363895149
those who did not know his face to guess in whose presence they were.	258.6611007886455
The poor mercer remained standing at the door, while the eyes of the	223.01123601660146
personage we have just described were fixed upon him, and appeared to	278.6590113210148
wish to penetrate even into the depths of the past.	353.5684803643671
“Is this that Bonacieux?” asked he, after a moment of silence.	333.47521601010124
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the officer.	236.79028289407785
“That’s well. Give me those papers, and leave us.”	208.1159126170945
The officer took from the table the papers pointed out, gave them to	229.42833185417774
him who asked for them, bowed to the ground, and retired.	284.10110390658116
Bonacieux recognized in these papers his interrogatories of the	215.0715408786601
Bastille. From time to time the man by the chimney raised his eyes from	348.0060619919309
the writings, and plunged them like poniards into the heart of the poor	246.77882185427984
mercer.	221.19701030181153
At the end of ten minutes of reading and ten seconds of examination,	344.55695998200446
the cardinal was satisfied.	251.764410423008
“That head has never conspired,” murmured he, “but it matters not; we	221.36953314802213
will see.”	275.786041752419
“You are accused of high treason,” said the cardinal, slowly.	201.35599474409108
“So I have been told already, monseigneur,” cried Bonacieux, giving his	238.22864232369375
interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him, “but I swear	307.75763909585083
to you that I know nothing about it.”	250.03833325816979
The cardinal repressed a smile.	198.69051267969715
“You have conspired with your wife, with Madame de Chevreuse, and with	273.74109697706484
my Lord Duke of Buckingham.”	357.52877076832533
“Indeed, monseigneur,” responded the mercer, “I have heard her	231.40764678935895
pronounce all those names.”	290.65936079021185
“And on what occasion?”	287.57003810532194
“She said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of	235.4973829994679
Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen.”	206.2020910266795
“She said that?” cried the cardinal, with violence.	203.4372078393551
“Yes, monseigneur, but I told her she was wrong to talk about such	259.50011885727935
things; and that his Eminence was incapable—”	193.7276943295433
“Hold your tongue! You are stupid,” replied the cardinal.	338.02446846805015
“That’s exactly what my wife said, monseigneur.”	270.8721159212148
“Do you know who carried off your wife?”	190.84413916877546
“No, monseigneur.”	220.0989091812272
“You have suspicions, nevertheless?”	196.8970327678225
“Yes, monseigneur; but these suspicions appeared to be disagreeable to	293.11025870751024
Monsieur the Commissary, and I no longer have them.”	220.0997065545946
“Your wife has escaped. Did you know that?”	312.84661049087714
“No, monseigneur. I learned it since I have been in prison, and that	210.88642248692022
from the conversation of Monsieur the Commissary—an amiable man.”	299.64042695717046
The cardinal repressed another smile.	339.4347872683018
“Then you are ignorant of what has become of your wife since her	175.26347765132516
flight.”	239.70859037788654
“Absolutely, monseigneur; but she has most likely returned to the	310.46629363021447
Louvre.”	252.43918959358385
“At one o’clock this morning she had not returned.”	356.6200435523058
“My God! What can have become of her, then?”	258.12727922726367
“We shall know, be assured. Nothing is concealed from the cardinal; the	275.50830981661204
cardinal knows everything.”	203.42723263675393
“In that case, monseigneur, do you believe the cardinal will be so kind	338.50578553672506
as to tell me what has become of my wife?”	282.499954565857
“Perhaps he may; but you must, in the first place, reveal to the	365.85164954544155
cardinal all you know of your wife’s relations with Madame de	308.479422122411
Chevreuse.”	286.30418239083133
“But, monseigneur, I know nothing about them; I have never seen her.”	278.90032288848977
“When you went to fetch your wife from the Louvre, did you always	204.51960464219516
return directly home?”	285.52247339836026
“Scarcely ever; she had business to transact with linen drapers, to	187.16640708326497
whose houses I conducted her.”	276.7266547340371
“And how many were there of these linen drapers?”	304.1740442974368
“Two, monseigneur.”	347.03610577263146
“And where did they live?”	324.173204989708
“One in Rue de Vaugirard, the other Rue de la Harpe.”	349.29865776680197
“Did you go into these houses with her?”	234.64024703855102
“Never, monseigneur; I waited at the door.”	186.052399623638
“And what excuse did she give you for entering all alone?”	354.2811936407967
“She gave me none; she told me to wait, and I waited.”	309.2627382715992
“You are a very complacent husband, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux,” said	181.95893120480721
the cardinal.	199.333821727888
“He calls me his dear Monsieur,” said the mercer to himself. “_Peste!_	180.0246572614902
Matters are going all right.”	184.7093171695506
“Should you know those doors again?”	309.5023198806225
“Yes.”	353.7670247636367
“Do you know the numbers?”	181.2890673805877
“Yes.”	289.3990731988913
“What are they?”	181.66294910133263
“No. 25 in the Rue de Vaugirard; 75 in the Rue de la Harpe.”	251.91311050595849
“That’s well,” said the cardinal.	313.360995905138
At these words he took up a silver bell, and rang it; the officer	270.3926316920749
entered.	365.66355868625806
“Go,” said he, in a subdued voice, “and find Rochefort. Tell him to	321.42745095466944
come to me immediately, if he has returned.”	259.32965615566064
“The count is here,” said the officer, “and requests to speak with your	359.6964283739676
Eminence instantly.”	229.9912610892928
“Let him come in, then!” said the cardinal, quickly.	362.6295948974762
The officer sprang out of the apartment with that alacrity which all	252.6221135831519
the servants of the cardinal displayed in obeying him.	244.50849670871332
“To your Eminence!” murmured Bonacieux, rolling his eyes round in	331.18013384420146
astonishment.	267.80073081287355
Five seconds has scarcely elapsed after the disappearance of the	223.7805675836713
officer, when the door opened, and a new personage entered.	206.82910373695853
“It is he!” cried Bonacieux.	216.90945245351077
“He! What he?” asked the cardinal.	177.0826920557562
“The man who abducted my wife.”	250.88169189005342
The cardinal rang a second time. The officer reappeared.	282.4633296923636
“Place this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till	231.03730039292623
I send for him.”	320.79662191726874
“No, monseigneur, no, it is not he!” cried Bonacieux; “no, I was	297.7461823682571
deceived. This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all.	299.32718394051335
Monsieur is, I am sure, an honest man.”	206.96579088878434
“Take away that fool!” said the cardinal.	223.18395560931907
The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the	206.55099104574887
antechamber, where he found his two guards.	217.04472518023982
The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his	266.3484265472947
eyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, “They have	235.55509355489528
seen each other;” said he, approaching the cardinal eagerly.	171.202707813635
“Who?” asked his Eminence.	170.9940931120374
“He and she.”	247.47837479793293
“The queen and the duke?” cried Richelieu.	227.64021893611942
“Yes.”	181.80651079243995
“Where?”	214.24533595942626
“At the Louvre.”	235.8077561498543
“Are you sure of it?”	200.28083548811853
“Perfectly sure.”	338.95979621327155
“Who told you of it?”	365.66738424565864
“Madame de Lannoy, who is devoted to your Eminence, as you know.”	259.758208108307
“Why did she not let me know sooner?”	345.874721010857
“Whether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep	174.64814890853697
in her chamber, and detained her all day.”	272.69990462266605
“Well, we are beaten! Now let us try to take our revenge.”	240.59463297025957
“I will assist you with all my heart, monseigneur; be assured of that.”	287.2806955179988
“How did it come about?”	167.3607888527211
“At half past twelve the queen was with her women—”	267.3828163447539
“Where?”	282.11781531099115
“In her bedchamber—”	285.0419886883959
“Go on.”	287.53648937948964
“When someone came and brought her a handkerchief from her laundress.”	187.17791046520838
“And then?”	295.84800819259834
“The queen immediately exhibited strong emotion; and despite the rouge	321.3756971025715
with which her face was covered evidently turned pale—”	236.50173305026965
“And then, and then?”	242.27083238493123
“She then arose, and with altered voice, ‘Ladies,’ said she, ‘wait for	337.337841816068
me ten minutes, I shall soon return.’ She then opened the door of her	344.6671319001065
alcove, and went out.”	258.86427423758033
“Why did not Madame de Lannoy come and inform you instantly?”	208.0006049661988
“Nothing was certain; besides, her Majesty had said, ‘Ladies, wait for	267.16060309068723
me,’ and she did not dare to disobey the queen.”	322.01632439179946
“How long did the queen remain out of the chamber?”	316.75863605775436
“Three-quarters of an hour.”	178.8852444158299
“None of her women accompanied her?”	348.8241606923193
“Only Donna Estafania.”	352.96580662965755
“Did she afterward return?”	190.88866703164862
“Yes; but only to take a little rosewood casket, with her cipher upon	287.64496371467703
it, and went out again immediately.”	198.3845047048862
“And when she finally returned, did she bring that casket with her?”	266.70319178262315
“No.”	302.557884014882
“Does Madame de Lannoy know what was in that casket?”	280.3036249974626
“Yes; the diamond studs which his Majesty gave the queen.”	224.88594741025534
“And she came back without this casket?”	255.2215275349159
“Yes.”	324.91275492365855
“Madame de Lannoy, then, is of opinion that she gave them to	192.01552691184793
Buckingham?”	361.67241958577495
“She is sure of it.”	347.61904035201314
“How can she be so?”	180.6085416073872
“In the course of the day Madame de Lannoy, in her quality of	230.7742584109618
tire-woman of the queen, looked for this casket, appeared uneasy at not	269.5286454405705
finding it, and at length asked information of the queen.”	220.4474430689229
“And then the queen?”	231.73284029183918
“The queen became exceedingly red, and replied that having in the	218.4514643541724
evening broken one of those studs, she had sent it to her goldsmith to	200.10970358358597
be repaired.”	181.84037080496606
“He must be called upon, and so ascertain if the thing be true or not.”	214.94957384369968
“I have just been with him.”	191.71603337777537
“And the goldsmith?”	175.1396364077381
“The goldsmith has heard nothing of it.”	261.98432726179016
“Well, well! Rochefort, all is not lost; and perhaps—perhaps everything	173.91500138109785
is for the best.”	322.02966692304955
“The fact is that I do not doubt your Eminence’s genius—”	169.9349707539909
“Will repair the blunders of his agent—is that it?”	321.3503004885491
“That is exactly what I was going to say, if your Eminence had let me	365.2056845848292
finish my sentence.”	351.25855197255055
“Meanwhile, do you know where the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	245.89244854303757
Buckingham are now concealed?”	234.4417473619942
“No, monseigneur; my people could tell me nothing on that head.”	302.8895689748675
“But I know.”	330.38517540073934
“You, monseigneur?”	214.41254924986995
“Yes; or at least I guess. They were, one in the Rue de Vaugirard, No.	231.0792371483617
25; the other in the Rue de la Harpe, No. 75.”	317.4704633880521
“Does your Eminence command that they both be instantly arrested?”	246.07463407578803
“It will be too late; they will be gone.”	194.19068593768213
“But still, we can make sure that they are so.”	314.06647976791817
“Take ten men of my Guardsmen, and search the two houses thoroughly.”	310.5152792128436
“Instantly, monseigneur.” And Rochefort went hastily out of the	353.7136763432526
apartment.	230.58696997913853
The cardinal, being left alone, reflected for an instant and then rang	269.3202849363881
the bell a third time. The same officer appeared.	201.5648394943927
“Bring the prisoner in again,” said the cardinal.	193.62357822031416
M. Bonacieux was introduced afresh, and upon a sign from the cardinal,	313.2653834052003
the officer retired.	307.35964357177454
“You have deceived me!” said the cardinal, sternly.	344.0371688208413
“I,” cried Bonacieux, “I deceive your Eminence!”	220.56945878347858
“Your wife, in going to Rue de Vaugirard and Rue de la Harpe, did not	241.89497128909343
go to find linen drapers.”	226.26127121944882
“Then why did she go, just God?”	291.7544929463037
“She went to meet the Duchesse de Chevreuse and the Duke of	199.2370862898544
Buckingham.”	233.01867198478044
“Yes,” cried Bonacieux, recalling all his remembrances of the	213.02391689722157
circumstances, “yes, that’s it. Your Eminence is right. I told my wife	296.60352506000186
several times that it was surprising that linen drapers should live in	290.8635484726021
such houses as those, in houses that had no signs; but she always	242.72103212159922
laughed at me. Ah, monseigneur!” continued Bonacieux, throwing himself	279.1102146409652
at his Eminence’s feet, “ah, how truly you are the cardinal, the great	349.9166891692936
cardinal, the man of genius whom all the world reveres!”	183.11813768263488
The cardinal, however contemptible might be the triumph gained over so	243.43424197584545
vulgar a being as Bonacieux, did not the less enjoy it for an instant;	329.98414950958545
then, almost immediately, as if a fresh thought has occurred, a smile	265.21799405115996
played upon his lips, and he said, offering his hand to the mercer,	185.055995431604
“Rise, my friend, you are a worthy man.”	284.14364817853277
“The cardinal has touched me with his hand! I have touched the hand of	273.5173758447423
the great man!” cried Bonacieux. “The great man has called me his	178.26608747743015
friend!”	302.53602470717857
“Yes, my friend, yes,” said the cardinal, with that paternal tone which	187.49139011776398
he sometimes knew how to assume, but which deceived none who knew him;	277.3772962517651
“and as you have been unjustly suspected, well, you must be	361.09820969884214
indemnified. Here, take this purse of a hundred pistoles, and pardon	308.8710644371443
me.”	247.0424552526307
“I pardon you, monseigneur!” said Bonacieux, hesitating to take the	292.9028797082641
purse, fearing, doubtless, that this pretended gift was but a	172.1765349896358
pleasantry. “But you are able to have me arrested, you are able to have	261.3691512775524
me tortured, you are able to have me hanged; you are the master, and I	203.71412389183502
could not have the least word to say. Pardon you, monseigneur! You	280.980326884559
cannot mean that!”	214.64404135120392
“Ah, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, you are generous in this matter. I see	330.7587643010033
it and I thank you for it. Thus, then, you will take this bag, and you	234.56966697501545
will go away without being too malcontent.”	190.18187808613948
“I go away enchanted.”	304.4451358225156
“Farewell, then, or rather, _au revoir_, for I hope we shall meet	217.08218690360468
again.”	218.44187957089707
“Whenever Monseigneur wishes, I am always at at his Eminence’s orders.”	255.79932483179502
“That will be frequently, I assure you, for I have found something	272.0511173514942
extremely agreeable in your conversation.”	296.86751902243475
“Oh! Monseigneur!”	299.59153518694734
“_Au revoir_, Monsieur Bonacieux, _au revoir!_”	352.2632944196041
And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux	344.8084021504386
replied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he	233.83230834496607
was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm,	348.4496336558442
crying aloud, “Long life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence!	353.44606096178074
Long life to the great cardinal!” The cardinal listened with a smile to	300.28686289690313
this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and	278.57866907819607
then, when Bonacieux’s cries were no longer audible, “Good!” said he,	200.90683020779142
“that man would henceforward lay down his life for me.” And the	351.38991316195177
cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of La	286.8786825819826
Rochelle, which, as we have said, lay open on the desk, tracing with a	330.0646695020402
pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which, eighteen	189.42727323711486
months later, shut up the port of the besieged city. As he was in the	179.5726704826512
deepest of his strategic meditations, the door opened, and Rochefort	197.14025676349377
returned.	356.0279948584588
“Well?” said the cardinal, eagerly, rising with a promptitude which	303.6122548275416
proved the degree of importance he attached to the commission with	173.14728281020928
which he had charged the count.	191.68842834377637
“Well,” said the latter, “a young woman of about twenty-six or	195.01923362453908
twenty-eight years of age, and a man of from thirty-five to forty, have	174.42196873583478
indeed lodged at the two houses pointed out by your Eminence; but the	327.05952211082484
woman left last night, and the man this morning.”	205.76723598154544
“It was they!” cried the cardinal, looking at the clock; “and now it is	182.58325790176823
too late to have them pursued. The duchess is at Tours, and the duke at	178.17410689180144
Boulogne. It is in London they must be found.”	214.60520502447494
“What are your Eminence’s orders?”	225.32070681946925
“Not a word of what has passed. Let the queen remain in perfect	232.35114374416838
security; let her be ignorant that we know her secret. Let her believe	244.5448450826256
that we are in search of some conspiracy or other. Send me the keeper	294.6237735938034
of the seals, Séguier.”	205.88851114298996
“And that man, what has your Eminence done with him?”	171.20280818025904
“What man?” asked the cardinal.	365.6174053059839
“That Bonacieux.”	197.31259133412533
“I have done with him all that could be done. I have made him a spy	281.4930098212945
upon his wife.”	210.6854795522953
The Comte de Rochefort bowed like a man who acknowledges the	308.3163471370109
superiority of the master as great, and retired.	207.90722557491554
Left alone, the cardinal seated himself again and wrote a letter, which	174.2354081645936
he secured with his special seal. Then he rang. The officer entered for	258.8399822557627
the fourth time.	201.33130650223745
“Tell Vitray to come to me,” said he, “and tell him to get ready for a	334.87610449077147
journey.”	308.1385474428716
An instant after, the man he asked for was before him, booted and	226.57332939801228
spurred.	357.13067798048917
“Vitray,” said he, “you will go with all speed to London. You must not	186.1450068462755
stop an instant on the way. You will deliver this letter to Milady.	241.39574817649532
Here is an order for two hundred pistoles; call upon my treasurer and	179.87161188024854
get the money. You shall have as much again if you are back within six	353.72404109393585
days, and have executed your commission well.”	309.10179471373
The messenger, without replying a single word, bowed, took the letter,	309.99647182546084
with the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired.	299.70237011370034
Here is what the letter contained:	183.87818965397113
MILADY, Be at the first ball at which the Duke of Buckingham shall be	297.87550795319123
present. He will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near	252.54979082355948
to him as you can, and cut off two.	336.4722169942464
As soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.	347.6642252307967
Chapter XV.	338.636038091399
MEN OF THE ROBE AND MEN OF THE SWORD	207.40300499847595
On the day after these events had taken place, Athos not having	327.34315462268745
reappeared, M. de Tréville was informed by D’Artagnan and Porthos of	258.41810400013173
the circumstance. As to Aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for	297.0165181835056
five days, and was gone, it was said, to Rouen on family business.	221.83229561657032
M. de Tréville was the father of his soldiers. The lowest or the least	257.61832159185235
known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as	282.81494261260343
sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.	212.6411712986657
He repaired, then, instantly to the office of the	266.7833816554086
_lieutenant-criminel_. The officer who commanded the post of the Red	318.06070963178803
Cross was sent for, and by successive inquiries they learned that Athos	343.70651134979744
was then lodged in Fort l’Evêque.	289.47000524537225
Athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen Bonacieux	212.4269723808176
undergo.	204.54537121164492
We were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted	236.12555434541815
with each other. Athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear	218.42203335442457
that D’Artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time	320.70489069617986
necessary, from this moment declared that his name was Athos, and not	260.12347339054077
D’Artagnan. He added that he did not know either M. or Mme. Bonacieux;	359.0130851450243
that he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at	243.58022757036218
about ten o’clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend M.	262.3035228423498
d’Artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at M. de Tréville’s,	225.09142852955884
where he had dined. “Twenty witnesses,” added he, “could attest the	286.1721057686715
fact”; and he named several distinguished gentlemen, and among them was	307.123519657893
M. le Duc de la Trémouille.	314.32371074906484
The second commissary was as much bewildered as the first had been by	329.41977901306205
the simple and firm declaration of the Musketeer, upon whom he was	307.75331768938986
anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to	319.29957313253425
gain over men of the sword; but the name of M. de Tréville, and that of	237.93214585853673
M. de la Trémouille, commanded a little reflection.	348.82817668685175
Athos was then sent to the cardinal; but unfortunately the cardinal was	274.6573226140643
at the Louvre with the king.	270.45756778207897
It was precisely at this moment that M. de Tréville, on leaving the	219.60879841285578
residence of the _lieutenant-criminel_ and the governor of Fort	321.64191675288413
l’Evêque without being able to find Athos, arrived at the palace.	310.4312003160162
As captain of the Musketeers, M. de Tréville had the right of entry at	341.2829970533646
all times.	234.08790375548818
It is well known how violent the king’s prejudices were against the	203.40244875167087
queen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept up by the cardinal,	364.4387640341786
who in affairs of intrigue mistrusted women infinitely more than men.	316.0568700468659
One of the grand causes of this prejudice was the friendship of Anne of	299.02945166176994
Austria for Mme. de Chevreuse. These two women gave him more uneasiness	221.66277590337015
than the war with Spain, the quarrel with England, or the embarrassment	177.56226451444635
of the finances. In his eyes and to his conviction, Mme. de Chevreuse	362.1394285719533
not only served the queen in her political intrigues, but, what	353.2728897907815
tormented him still more, in her amorous intrigues.	244.9934321929343
At the first word the cardinal spoke of Mme. de Chevreuse—who, though	339.57567481159566
exiled to Tours and believed to be in that city, had come to Paris,	355.0317750330688
remained there five days, and outwitted the police—the king flew into a	250.3670890827477
furious passion. Capricious and unfaithful, the king wished to be	253.20440492064523
called Louis the Just and Louis the Chaste. Posterity will find a	265.6733997722429
difficulty in understanding this character, which history explains only	350.0827018208146
by facts and never by reason.	231.65525212794765
But when the cardinal added that not only Mme. de Chevreuse had been in	328.3862172587588
Paris, but still further, that the queen had renewed with her one of	295.1325564813604
those mysterious correspondences which at that time was named a	266.212810556039
_cabal;_ when he affirmed that he, the cardinal, was about to unravel	242.57971451629612
the most closely twisted thread of this intrigue; that at the moment of	339.9470465267439
arresting in the very act, with all the proofs about her, the queen’s	288.5832245317699
emissary to the exiled duchess, a Musketeer had dared to interrupt the	247.7104085091454
course of justice violently, by falling sword in hand upon the honest	222.08220479201947
men of the law, charged with investigating impartially the whole affair	301.1090655587956
in order to place it before the eyes of the king—Louis XIII. could not	257.52867797193306
contain himself, and he made a step toward the queen’s apartment with	195.82117996598768
that pale and mute indignation which, when it broke out, led this	361.46914787969047
prince to the commission of the most pitiless cruelty. And yet, in all	342.6834385076146
this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of	353.5843731123715
Buckingham.	345.4692550115201
At this instant M. de Tréville entered, cool, polite, and in	337.01512111237514
irreproachable costume.	204.44192936884875
Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the	360.83008086568304
alteration in the king’s countenance, M. de Tréville felt himself	349.4722903993004
something like Samson before the Philistines.	308.29783150613184
Louis XIII. had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the	312.77099295625356
noise of M. de Tréville’s entrance he turned round. “You arrive in good	269.7953046955996
time, monsieur,” said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a	202.04283028814515
certain point, could not dissemble; “I have learned some fine things	179.0008139478369
concerning your Musketeers.”	270.2546244191532
“And I,” said Tréville, coldly, “I have some pretty things to tell your	333.14169974666174
Majesty concerning these gownsmen.”	335.07557498323376
“What?” said the king, with hauteur.	309.6053799655535
“I have the honor to inform your Majesty,” continued M. de Tréville, in	166.24601856586045
the same tone, “that a party of _procureurs_, commissaries, and men of	193.18317789488583
the police—very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears,	282.32894428354655
against the uniform—have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to	252.99348402582277
lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l’Evêque, all	348.5871368797997
upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather	206.72289906202573
your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost	230.24411657989717
illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur	181.7644525648116
Athos.”	250.04125303326128
“Athos,” said the king, mechanically; “yes, certainly I know that	361.3715855111268
name.”	256.8885802016666
“Let your Majesty remember,” said Tréville, “that Monsieur Athos is the	225.6678585531784
Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had	207.4969274053638
the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously. _A propos_,	223.9214491276797
monseigneur,” continued Tréville, addressing the cardinal, “Monsieur de	251.63095015770278
Cahusac is quite recovered, is he not?”	260.780956454078
“Thank you,” said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger.	341.5999197377648
“Athos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the	350.877433212843
time,” continued Tréville, “to a young Béarnais, a cadet in his	281.47505542790833
Majesty’s Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely had	216.38268348708334
he arrived at his friend’s and taken up a book, while waiting his	279.3298048169826
return, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege	261.4999861059771
to the house, broke open several doors—”	205.22806988858645
The cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, “That was on	335.37145411896
account of the affair about which I spoke to you.”	344.95553330909604
“We all know that,” interrupted the king; “for all that was done for	350.78377720489686
our service.”	228.36543784643223
“Then,” said Tréville, “it was also for your Majesty’s service that one	263.44839800719916
of my Musketeers, who was innocent, has been seized, that he has been	297.4727113303438
placed between two guards like a malefactor, and that this gallant man,	296.12223368230923
who has ten times shed his blood in your Majesty’s service and is ready	192.99847850231077
to shed it again, has been paraded through the midst of an insolent	197.09034971062326
populace?”	333.67839166959317
“Bah!” said the king, who began to be shaken, “was it so managed?”	195.30197188809413
“Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm,	354.3906485009703
“does not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant	205.85009976809903
man, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries	288.0161461665474
of inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of	202.92248833491212
the highest importance.”	184.56478204317085
“I defy your Eminence to prove it,” cried Tréville, with his Gascon	299.3090962558323
freedom and military frankness; “for one hour before, Monsieur Athos,	259.41390156852424
who, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest	264.8230275531101
quality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing	353.843439054002
in the saloon of my hôtel, with the Duc de la Trémouille and the Comte	325.3060259417339
de Châlus, who happened to be there.”	260.23715260558976
The king looked at the cardinal.	363.28868528417433
“A written examination attests it,” said the cardinal, replying aloud	313.2421837936133
to the mute interrogation of his Majesty; “and the ill-treated people	202.59658558681707
have drawn up the following, which I have the honor to present to your	348.81639086689535
Majesty.”	198.48707144612115
“And is the written report of the gownsmen to be placed in comparison	247.6100284347075
with the word of honor of a swordsman?” replied Tréville haughtily.	237.12340368035748
“Come, come, Tréville, hold your tongue,” said the king.	205.85276793538205
“If his Eminence entertains any suspicion against one of my	363.21047687704163
Musketeers,” said Tréville, “the justice of Monsieur the Cardinal is so	253.8791290548254
well known that I demand an inquiry.”	205.06369435761206
“In the house in which the judicial inquiry was made,” continued the	210.39313691425806
impassive cardinal, “there lodges, I believe, a young Béarnais, a	247.03191640994334
friend of the Musketeer.”	243.19144757666305
“Your Eminence means Monsieur d’Artagnan.”	237.9121642357415
“I mean a young man whom you patronize, Monsieur de Tréville.”	188.81486912425362
“Yes, your Eminence, it is the same.”	321.22315372306235
“Do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?”	191.00220385244188
“To Athos, to a man double his age?” interrupted Tréville. “No,	211.31592880718338
monseigneur. Besides, D’Artagnan passed the evening with me.”	207.48668654994916
“Well,” said the cardinal, “everybody seems to have passed the evening	258.8292525892822
with you.”	170.84899906341894
“Does your Eminence doubt my word?” said Tréville, with a brow flushed	237.04720988845452
with anger.	274.12199381616347
“No, God forbid,” said the cardinal; “only, at what hour was he with	244.19452600250048
you?”	218.40739585568397
“Oh, as to that I can speak positively, your Eminence; for as he came	324.5954118423622
in I remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock, although I	211.09814211545134
had believed it to be later.”	290.54152066532856
“At what hour did he leave your hôtel?”	170.7573227497798
“At half past ten—an hour after the event.”	209.08844908144192
“Well,” replied the cardinal, who could not for an instant suspect the	280.4250059913411
loyalty of Tréville, and who felt that the victory was escaping him,	285.6674837413813
“well, but Athos _was_ taken in the house in the Rue des Fossoyeurs.”	341.5897972743098
“Is one friend forbidden to visit another, or a Musketeer of my company	202.03806203259836
to fraternize with a Guard of Dessessart’s company?”	247.30467321724518
“Yes, when the house where he fraternizes is suspected.”	268.45648891302153
“That house is suspected, Tréville,” said the king; “perhaps you did	338.03130008446493
not know it?”	344.7974872939467
“Indeed, sire, I did not. The house may be suspected; but I deny that	330.8041071839385
it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d’Artagnan, for I can	188.80569457342497
affirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist	339.1181930396756
a more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of	226.4628851584621
Monsieur the Cardinal.”	168.0561882624633
“Was it not this D’Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that	175.3133262567975
unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the	300.76368898322426
Carmes-Déchaussés?” asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who	267.8463646971518
colored with vexation.	209.44557102117406
“And the next day, Bernajoux. Yes, sire, yes, it is the same; and your	250.30158040531566
Majesty has a good memory.”	270.22989711643777
“Come, how shall we decide?” said the king.	353.7485641399402
“That concerns your Majesty more than me,” said the cardinal. “I should	307.4914939851095
affirm the culpability.”	270.122152457746
“And I deny it,” said Tréville. “But his Majesty has judges, and these	353.6207867425758
judges will decide.”	282.91213806006385
“That is best,” said the king. “Send the case before the judges; it is	284.0356301629956
their business to judge, and they shall judge.”	286.7665441296444
“Only,” replied Tréville, “it is a sad thing that in the unfortunate	212.37899771073995
times in which we live, the purest life, the most incontestable virtue,	287.81062662862496
cannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution. The army, I will	314.3149722052371
answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous	311.67140761466794
treatment on account of police affairs.”	261.67422365684115
The expression was imprudent; but M. de Tréville launched it with	340.52000035977045
knowledge of his cause. He was desirous of an explosion, because in	300.60871769008463
that case the mine throws forth fire, and fire enlightens.	263.59032122867006
“Police affairs!” cried the king, taking up Tréville’s words, “police	187.39524476595417
affairs! And what do you know about them, Monsieur? Meddle with your	267.017888237412
Musketeers, and do not annoy me in this way. It appears, according to	190.2800223060912
your account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is	226.3596524259329
in danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them,	340.5683521614966
_ventrebleu_, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a	218.48253569989612
whisper.”	246.2604101594934
“From the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,” said Tréville,	228.3338088319622
“the Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender	180.3408641349992
my sword—for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt	244.0508861720176
that Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me. It is best to	347.449713714296
constitute myself at once a prisoner with Athos, who is already	306.6337203087961
arrested, and with D’Artagnan, who most probably will be.”	245.76213791182897
“Gascon-headed man, will you have done?” said the king.	204.3471594831068
“Sire,” replied Tréville, without lowering his voice in the least,	182.43952084202112
“either order my Musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried.”	187.97826138034688
“He shall be tried,” said the cardinal.	307.56337036770526
“Well, so much the better; for in that case I shall demand of his	201.7275684005804
Majesty permission to plead for him.”	330.05199025978027
The king feared an outbreak.	188.9630570395617
“If his Eminence,” said he, “did not have personal motives—”	270.1777009734679
The cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:	326.5440670933224
“Pardon me,” said he; “but the instant your Majesty considers me a	305.57356568606156
prejudiced judge, I withdraw.”	262.79827060169976
“Come,” said the king, “will you swear, by my father, that Athos was at	275.54804556304816
your residence during the event and that he took no part in it?”	207.98859279060238
“By your glorious father, and by yourself, whom I love and venerate	173.58686817676252
above all the world, I swear it.”	248.14353701032664
“Be so kind as to reflect, sire,” said the cardinal. “If we release the	351.3912122594942
prisoner thus, we shall never know the truth.”	248.28636011873368
“Athos may always be found,” replied Tréville, “ready to answer, when	188.72492600341107
it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him. He will not desert,	271.27448648304414
Monsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him.”	224.76624327167232
“No, he will not desert,” said the king; “he can always be found, as	320.04205373471757
Tréville says. Besides,” added he, lowering his voice and looking with	169.41123618329203
a suppliant air at the cardinal, “let us give them apparent security;	225.55910001831253
that is policy.”	320.94686439217554
This policy of Louis XIII. made Richelieu smile.	345.7265662069045
“Order it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon.”	339.5665543503418
“The right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,” said Tréville, who	345.0110057696379
was determined to have the last word, “and my Musketeer is innocent. It	333.60240194899995
is not mercy, then, that you are about to accord, sire, it is justice.”	297.03710089754526
“And he is in the Fort l’Evêque?” said the king.	168.12717855498465
“Yes, sire, in solitary confinement, in a dungeon, like the lowest	289.0167722912777
criminal.”	272.57184263301144
“The devil!” murmured the king; “what must be done?”	175.55262359926786
“Sign an order for his release, and all will be said,” replied the	216.06099735350165
cardinal. “I believe with your Majesty that Monsieur de Tréville’s	283.9969985223607
guarantee is more than sufficient.”	276.8227299199084
Tréville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with	207.70275126327425
fear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of	182.5243520192688
the cardinal to this sudden yielding.	200.5041364310245
The king signed the order for release, and Tréville carried it away	344.57188826905224
without delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave	210.81764123095388
him a friendly smile, and said, “A perfect harmony reigns, sire,	230.8628822359438
between the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be	364.56552202988166
profitable for the service and honorable to all.”	312.1149959149833
“He will play me some dog’s trick or other, and that immediately,” said	357.86300372752095
Tréville. “One has never the last word with such a man. But let us be	306.24925313478866
quick—the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is	357.8230760293301
more difficult to replace a man in the Fort l’Evêque or the Bastille	316.1766805572205
who has got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in.”	278.1009065697393
M. de Tréville made his entrance triumphantly into the Fort l’Evêque,	175.06850943009252
whence he delivered the Musketeer, whose peaceful indifference had not	341.14063324484584
for a moment abandoned him.	254.00733400602488
The first time he saw D’Artagnan, “You have come off well,” said he to	226.47434242105425
him; “there is your Jussac thrust paid for. There still remains that of	357.2210726800537
Bernajoux, but you must not be too confident.”	241.28897879286683
As to the rest, M. de Tréville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal	240.30457928676395
and to think that all was not over, for scarcely had the captain of the	344.3193603959862
Musketeers closed the door after him, than his Eminence said to the	361.6773878550319
king, “Now that we are at length by ourselves, we will, if your Majesty	331.5059549006189
pleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five	183.36505526282565
days, and only left this morning.”	345.27778105635673
Chapter XVI.	322.75956114152405
IN WHICH M. SÉGUIER, KEEPER OF THE SEALS, LOOKS MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE	186.56205430589196
BELL	204.4143853122689
It is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made	203.90033241295166
upon Louis XIII. He grew pale and red alternately; and the cardinal saw	262.7940894592062
at once that he had recovered by a single blow all the ground he had	220.46375992931814
lost.	205.32793674516262
“Buckingham in Paris!” cried he, “and why does he come?”	276.49971413096677
“To conspire, no doubt, with your enemies, the Huguenots and the	322.59766435118075
Spaniards.”	327.72869379040145
“No, _pardieu_, no! To conspire against my honor with Madame de	186.03765897498366
Chevreuse, Madame de Longueville, and the Condés.”	253.26207472304253
“Oh, sire, what an idea! The queen is too virtuous; and besides, loves	338.0980240946215
your Majesty too well.”	324.60327198547213
“Woman is weak, Monsieur Cardinal,” said the king; “and as to loving me	298.05652913501797
much, I have my own opinion as to that love.”	250.74050990949897
“I not the less maintain,” said the cardinal, “that the Duke of	208.34069583516649
Buckingham came to Paris for a project wholly political.”	260.53783646454167
“And I am sure that he came for quite another purpose, Monsieur	259.40707268746536
Cardinal; but if the queen be guilty, let her tremble!”	305.39431954449606
“Indeed,” said the cardinal, “whatever repugnance I may have to	192.9599341781381
directing my mind to such a treason, your Majesty compels me to think	338.57529839004536
of it. Madame de Lannoy, whom, according to your Majesty’s command, I	363.478704248418
have frequently interrogated, told me this morning that the night	354.99207429460034
before last her Majesty sat up very late, that this morning she wept	269.81089051743476
much, and that she was writing all day.”	262.5199650434803
“That’s it!” cried the king; “to him, no doubt. Cardinal, I must have	296.2351372971578
the queen’s papers.”	229.19382747906414
“But how to take them, sire? It seems to me that it is neither your	224.11730159348832
Majesty nor myself who can charge himself with such a mission.”	309.2977502444261
“How did they act with regard to the Maréchale d’Ancre?” cried the	347.2202906044382
king, in the highest state of choler; “first her closets were	352.1009454276208
thoroughly searched, and then she herself.”	280.774059380628
“The Maréchale d’Ancre was no more than the Maréchale d’Ancre. A	188.01254278531405
Florentine adventurer, sire, and that was all; while the august spouse	187.79608082790847
of your Majesty is Anne of Austria, Queen of France—that is to say, one	219.32152221731997
of the greatest princesses in the world.”	244.76457110909593
“She is not the less guilty, Monsieur Duke! The more she has forgotten	298.77256462297385
the high position in which she was placed, the more degrading is her	187.4473778635371
fall. Besides, I long ago determined to put an end to all these petty	232.22550587647464
intrigues of policy and love. She has near her a certain Laporte.”	307.21484999822053
“Who, I believe, is the mainspring of all this, I confess,” said the	304.9929788261078
cardinal.	192.01339447429717
“You think then, as I do, that she deceives me?” said the king.	271.1216479788147
“I believe, and I repeat it to your Majesty, that the queen conspires	292.57140974872806
against the power of the king, but I have not said against his honor.”	187.36488521440762
“And I—I tell you against both. I tell you the queen does not love me;	320.71286218643775
I tell you she loves another; I tell you she loves that infamous	277.56069590326683
Buckingham! Why did you not have him arrested while in Paris?”	194.00640395596244
“Arrest the Duke! Arrest the prime minister of King Charles I.! Think	194.05710297763443
of it, sire! What a scandal! And if the suspicions of your Majesty,	234.037470762037
which I still continue to doubt, should prove to have any foundation,	337.7156853431595
what a terrible disclosure, what a fearful scandal!”	279.3649948319607
“But as he exposed himself like a vagabond or a thief, he should have	225.6753301926617
been—”	230.9349261884154
Louis XIII. stopped, terrified at what he was about to say, while	182.571365623919
Richelieu, stretching out his neck, waited uselessly for the word which	232.01061873901438
had died on the lips of the king.	321.3545195222961
“He should have been—?”	287.12143621997757
“Nothing,” said the king, “nothing. But all the time he was in Paris,	268.1140277619369
you, of course, did not lose sight of him?”	345.9626473823121
“No, sire.”	294.70098189189935
“Where did he lodge?”	215.69173045252717
“Rue de la Harpe. No. 75.”	239.48127869399917
“Where is that?”	296.40691262823276
“By the side of the Luxembourg.”	348.83768214019324
“And you are certain that the queen and he did not see each other?”	300.8871092461842
“I believe the queen to have too high a sense of her duty, sire.”	244.649442856535
“But they have corresponded; it is to him that the queen has been	353.4328230168328
writing all the day. Monsieur Duke, I must have those letters!”	344.3525270944814
“Sire, notwithstanding—”	254.3490901928931
“Monsieur Duke, at whatever price it may be, I will have them.”	192.13000881439848
“I would, however, beg your Majesty to observe—”	175.0682284798949
“Do you, then, also join in betraying me, Monsieur Cardinal, by thus	166.8350468622425
always opposing my will? Are you also in accord with Spain and England,	353.0018180266485
with Madame de Chevreuse and the queen?”	295.8136971638721
“Sire,” replied the cardinal, sighing, “I believed myself secure from	227.3602086898642
such a suspicion.”	307.4578615714149
“Monsieur Cardinal, you have heard me; I will have those letters.”	322.1250144929528
“There is but one way.”	168.1294664708384
“What is that?”	197.52231954952597
“That would be to charge Monsieur de Séguier, the keeper of the seals,	241.08963469013213
with this mission. The matter enters completely into the duties of the	322.2893143291993
post.”	233.27647717504908
“Let him be sent for instantly.”	252.1727741897863
“He is most likely at my hôtel. I requested him to call, and when I	329.183584862175
came to the Louvre I left orders if he came, to desire him to wait.”	228.8403150712844
“Let him be sent for instantly.”	305.7344066485426
“Your Majesty’s orders shall be executed; but—”	244.82284485857986
“But what?”	259.0941412488308
“But the queen will perhaps refuse to obey.”	345.38261887493024
“My orders?”	217.3229801196979
“Yes, if she is ignorant that these orders come from the king.”	279.02151399178797
“Well, that she may have no doubt on that head, I will go and inform	230.0967201978873
her myself.”	173.6646098050891
“Your Majesty will not forget that I have done everything in my power	167.15577881866707
to prevent a rupture.”	261.7751222472665
“Yes, Duke, yes, I know you are very indulgent toward the queen, too	170.20807772894133
indulgent, perhaps; we shall have occasion, I warn you, at some future	357.74879616937926
period to speak of that.”	184.17639034421381
“Whenever it shall please your Majesty; but I shall be always happy and	232.85125513442586
proud, sire, to sacrifice myself to the harmony which I desire to see	286.6551207024127
reign between you and the Queen of France.”	250.19938937286267
“Very well, Cardinal, very well; but, meantime, send for Monsieur the	199.99634512782896
Keeper of the Seals. I will go to the queen.”	240.75042899033014
And Louis XIII., opening the door of communication, passed into the	246.59441569418095
corridor which led from his apartments to those of Anne of Austria.	190.59243520014414
The queen was in the midst of her women—Mme. de Guitaut, Mme. de Sable,	228.28354801708724
Mme. de Montbazon, and Mme. de Guémené. In a corner was the Spanish	323.49052172414326
companion, Donna Estafania, who had followed her from Madrid. Mme.	265.65665534311285
Guémené was reading aloud, and everybody was listening to her with	221.10174639504532
attention with the exception of the queen, who had, on the contrary,	172.7549460725479
desired this reading in order that she might be able, while feigning to	280.2984810105685
listen, to pursue the thread of her own thoughts.	310.59144354851435
These thoughts, gilded as they were by a last reflection of love, were	320.13064019244143
not the less sad. Anne of Austria, deprived of the confidence of her	231.20416617676847
husband, pursued by the hatred of the cardinal, who could not pardon	352.86192996807813
her for having repulsed a more tender feeling, having before her eyes	279.2135098068097
the example of the queen-mother whom that hatred had tormented all her	343.57609937451764
life—though Marie de Médicis, if the memoirs of the time are to be	218.0211937167575
believed, had begun by according to the cardinal that sentiment which	223.4014706952659
Anne of Austria always refused him—Anne of Austria had seen her most	207.09269321094365
devoted servants fall around her, her most intimate confidants, her	273.0611671996165
dearest favorites. Like those unfortunate persons endowed with a fatal	339.51160221401585
gift, she brought misfortune upon everything she touched. Her	332.48460152248987
friendship was a fatal sign which called down persecution. Mme. de	236.17397095546522
Chevreuse and Mme. de Bernet were exiled, and Laporte did not conceal	228.97335325930743
from his mistress that he expected to be arrested every instant.	183.63919883318616
It was at the moment when she was plunged in the deepest and darkest of	323.0538239387723
these reflections that the door of the chamber opened, and the king	175.19833318863
entered.	172.0218420915526
The reader hushed herself instantly. All the ladies rose, and there was	269.6054204133489
a profound silence. As to the king, he made no demonstration of	230.54485020313285
politeness, only stopping before the queen. “Madame,” said he, “you are	215.60798699533854
about to receive a visit from the chancellor, who will communicate	291.4208311183652
certain matters to you with which I have charged him.”	280.59523671128534
The unfortunate queen, who was constantly threatened with divorce,	351.29851130924067
exile, and trial even, turned pale under her rouge, and could not	315.9129016731724
refrain from saying, “But why this visit, sire? What can the chancellor	335.76339232020916
have to say to me that your Majesty could not say yourself?”	175.60511611417311
The king turned upon his heel without reply, and almost at the same	216.5392189949149
instant the captain of the Guards, M. de Guitant, announced the visit	215.04002921619616
of the chancellor.	292.70413419020963
When the chancellor appeared, the king had already gone out by another	259.7179886959507
door.	170.22351599604548
The chancellor entered, half smiling, half blushing. As we shall	274.3222705621024
probably meet with him again in the course of our history, it may be	275.9516433224365
well for our readers to be made at once acquainted with him.	359.18620797858796
This chancellor was a pleasant man. He was Des Roches le Masle, canon	178.43984154524534
of Notre Dame, who had formerly been valet of a bishop, who introduced	273.96476283223893
him to his Eminence as a perfectly devout man. The cardinal trusted	212.82786834542708
him, and therein found his advantage.	353.27449183308147
There are many stories related of him, and among them this. After a	320.4532764966848
wild youth, he had retired into a convent, there to expiate, at least	225.23654642392341
for some time, the follies of adolescence. On entering this holy place,	288.2673875256368
the poor penitent was unable to shut the door so close as to prevent	305.51036000224883
the passions he fled from entering with him. He was incessantly	216.86591474175663
attacked by them, and the superior, to whom he had confided this	292.3177046287284
misfortune, wishing as much as in him lay to free him from them, had	299.6598271099564
advised him, in order to conjure away the tempting demon, to have	184.67709626498026
recourse to the bell rope, and ring with all his might. At the	242.02711476087845
denunciating sound, the monks would be rendered aware that temptation	344.3980089223521
was besieging a brother, and all the community would go to prayers.	343.2037502973319
This advice appeared good to the future chancellor. He conjured the	178.0175918453023
evil spirit with abundance of prayers offered up by the monks. But the	282.99297864017547
devil does not suffer himself to be easily dispossessed from a place in	246.36140167929454
which he has fixed his garrison. In proportion as they redoubled the	223.20898618379383
exorcisms he redoubled the temptations; so that day and night the bell	337.12634923704525
was ringing full swing, announcing the extreme desire for mortification	215.77183329885207
which the penitent experienced.	364.18706692789436
The monks had no longer an instant of repose. By day they did nothing	243.60809284525664
but ascend and descend the steps which led to the chapel; at night, in	283.64465417050735
addition to complines and matins, they were further obliged to leap	256.48624879689675
twenty times out of their beds and prostrate themselves on the floor of	360.73211670189767
their cells.	311.2122484238791
It is not known whether it was the devil who gave way, or the monks who	200.34930063928277
grew tired; but within three months the penitent reappeared in the	355.30088922560014
world with the reputation of being the most terrible _possessed_ that	344.75352232940975
ever existed.	320.93213816602656
On leaving the convent he entered into the magistracy, became president	179.05649916865423
on the place of his uncle, embraced the cardinal’s party, which did not	253.4272015269566
prove want of sagacity, became chancellor, served his Eminence with	191.33121440018732
zeal in his hatred against the queen-mother and his vengeance against	176.10899699127435
Anne of Austria, stimulated the judges in the affair of Calais,	330.3133257182112
encouraged the attempts of M. de Laffemas, chief gamekeeper of France;	166.1732491918606
then, at length, invested with the entire confidence of the cardinal—a	189.34999706477225
confidence which he had so well earned—he received the singular	248.57483759765594
commission for the execution of which he presented himself in the	243.72234443287329
queen’s apartments.	168.55922075779029
The queen was still standing when he entered; but scarcely had she	225.28732686306776
perceived him then she reseated herself in her armchair, and made a	332.5442713208254
sign to her women to resume their cushions and stools, and with an air	208.54805794150954
of supreme hauteur, said, “What do you desire, monsieur, and with what	216.14483327827884
object do you present yourself here?”	348.6083059794038
“To make, madame, in the name of the king, and without prejudice to the	210.6597557109141
respect which I have the honor to owe to your Majesty a close	363.6787274850401
examination into all your papers.”	340.1433112382939
“How, monsieur, an investigation of my papers—mine! Truly, this is an	358.7705141104549
indignity!”	177.28049983530929
“Be kind enough to pardon me, madame; but in this circumstance I am but	263.64621763066987
the instrument which the king employs. Has not his Majesty just left	259.7004960200682
you, and has he not himself asked you to prepare for this visit?”	256.5067299723934
“Search, then, monsieur! I am a criminal, as it appears. Estafania,	238.47171622792888
give up the keys of my drawers and my desks.”	362.5239276249363
For form’s sake the chancellor paid a visit to the pieces of furniture	260.278089676028
named; but he well knew that it was not in a piece of furniture that	336.0446525120245
the queen would place the important letter she had written that day.	230.29339771542283
When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the	304.21917596643846
secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might	214.098702251278
experience—it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the	228.93318995190373
affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor	250.7975400408494
advanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very	282.4331868237804
perplexed and embarrassed air, “And now it remains for me to make the	278.78378195986124
principal examination.”	264.2676802463801
“What is that?” asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was	218.89693204167395
not willing to understand.	295.62569353622166
“His majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during	228.50470541653533
the day; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This	185.65926203245888
letter is not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter	299.0168487866924
must be somewhere.”	208.5723681574728
“Would you dare to lift your hand to your queen?” said Anne of Austria,	298.4087572201644
drawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the	229.64285734992907
chancellor with an expression almost threatening.	244.60841658531643
“I am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty	225.5508850853337
commands I shall do.”	250.5889835233705
“Well, it is true!” said Anne of Austria; “and the spies of the	234.06101363841626
cardinal have served him faithfully. I have written a letter today;	215.43036489913055
that letter is not yet gone. The letter is here.” And the queen laid	173.5450508421695
her beautiful hand on her bosom.	271.34871094880907
“Then give me that letter, madame,” said the chancellor.	182.8321596978165
“I will give it to none but the king, monsieur,” said Anne.	364.6661780884573
“If the king had desired that the letter should be given to him,	327.6950242440886
madame, he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you,	259.4556722841535
I am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up—”	283.7074168104893
“Well?”	183.52799467691392
“He has, then, charged me to take it from you.”	301.81399907067055
“How! What do you say?”	182.36957766724018
“That my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for	197.77240141220773
the suspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.”	340.910789537431
“What horror!” cried the queen.	342.31799005075555
“Be kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.”	184.80783039317043
“The conduct is infamously violent! Do you know that, monsieur?”	262.12003549624455
“The king commands it, madame; excuse me.”	297.22194807798985
“I will not suffer it! No, no, I would rather die!” cried the queen, in	257.1921241651552
whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise.	336.3933062938907
The chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention	221.30080976689666
quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the	212.86043608924763
commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an	331.5776421582921
executioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached	358.3829414196898
Anne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of	289.5163809152638
rage.	249.83223012750696
The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might	183.14678923810916
well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of	217.42698800863997
Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.	295.8364004569586
Without doubt the chancellor Séguier looked about at that moment for	261.13318686322106
the rope of the famous bell; but not finding it he summoned his	323.80692348027424
resolution, and stretched forth his hands toward the place where the	178.24760129272508
queen had acknowledged the paper was to be found.	253.18962305020176
Anne of Austria took one step backward, became so pale that it might be	260.55840266193457
said she was dying, and leaning with her left hand upon a table behind	332.11759964605335
her to keep herself from falling, she with her right hand drew the	213.51081395487898
paper from her bosom and held it out to the keeper of the seals.	194.60540660224964
“There, monsieur, there is that letter!” cried the queen, with a broken	296.15902024373963
and trembling voice; “take it, and deliver me from your odious	215.1082934927278
presence.”	313.2483913025857
The chancellor, who, on his part, trembled with an emotion easily to be	331.1050647455362
conceived, took the letter, bowed to the ground, and retired. The door	236.23426981781122
was scarcely closed upon him, when the queen sank, half fainting, into	197.9151839402965
the arms of her women.	237.42984762460858
The chancellor carried the letter to the king without having read a	295.1290827496256
single word of it. The king took it with a trembling hand, looked for	334.70417540234837
the address, which was wanting, became very pale, opened it slowly,	337.4385607732695
then seeing by the first words that it was addressed to the King of	180.4462025428367
Spain, he read it rapidly.	291.70423273213675
It was nothing but a plan of attack against the cardinal. The queen	352.7106633714867
pressed her brother and the Emperor of Austria to appear to be wounded,	169.391947376104
as they really were, by the policy of Richelieu—the eternal object of	345.3271106074865
which was the abasement of the house of Austria—to declare war against	325.86842486954373
France, and as a condition of peace, to insist upon the dismissal of	203.1448887209599
the cardinal; but as to love, there was not a single word about it in	321.7973225395839
all the letter.	323.1619625568434
The king, quite delighted, inquired if the cardinal was still at the	306.3893995594605
Louvre; he was told that his Eminence awaited the orders of his Majesty	183.77850401835155
in the business cabinet.	184.27537905549698
The king went straight to him.	342.6005489205492
“There, Duke,” said he, “you were right and I was wrong. The whole	298.66643186643194
intrigue is political, and there is not the least question of love in	285.18881550039083
this letter; but, on the other hand, there is abundant question of	296.3810510064361
you.”	270.0366901117089
The cardinal took the letter, and read it with the greatest attention;	202.5745805172285
then, when he had arrived at the end of it, he read it a second time.	359.0902459281421
“Well, your Majesty,” said he, “you see how far my enemies go; they	174.5496396263075
menace you with two wars if you do not dismiss me. In your place, in	297.214016841352
truth, sire, I should yield to such powerful instance; and on my part,	202.81746612654845
it would be a real happiness to withdraw from public affairs.”	245.76807337837633
“What say you, Duke?”	171.32300905149597
“I say, sire, that my health is sinking under these excessive struggles	292.3802670525964
and these never-ending labors. I say that according to all probability	182.54870299017352
I shall not be able to undergo the fatigues of the siege of La	348.54949003518954
Rochelle, and that it would be far better that you should appoint there	175.31503330274606
either Monsieur de Condé, Monsieur de Bassopierre, or some valiant	221.38298712605692
gentleman whose business is war, and not me, who am a churchman, and	180.64706693551747
who am constantly turned aside for my real vocation to look after	287.90698224859324
matters for which I have no aptitude. You would be the happier for it	243.51173562930998
at home, sire, and I do not doubt you would be the greater for it	223.51890572696857
abroad.”	197.9303798357914
“Monsieur Duke,” said the king, “I understand you. Be satisfied, all	282.2253487903944
who are named in that letter shall be punished as they deserve, even	174.9822770219246
the queen herself.”	166.72712667527722
“What do you say, sire? God forbid that the queen should suffer the	254.31998576799978
least inconvenience or uneasiness on my account! She has always	222.95502603454446
believed me, sire, to be her enemy; although your Majesty can bear	344.7019563635423
witness that I have always taken her part warmly, even against you. Oh,	201.1926001054705
if she betrayed your Majesty on the side of your honor, it would be	295.0388106182273
quite another thing, and I should be the first to say, ‘No grace,	172.19519588423128
sire—no grace for the guilty!’ Happily, there is nothing of the kind,	173.82442189195572
and your Majesty has just acquired a new proof of it.”	221.92493328391188
“That is true, Monsieur Cardinal,” said the king, “and you were right,	294.2113020294148
as you always are; but the queen, not the less, deserves all my anger.”	264.39003187699996
“It is you, sire, who have now incurred hers. And even if she were to	353.9409186020047
be seriously offended, I could well understand it; your Majesty has	201.14562628171714
treated her with a severity—”	349.6154372173479
“It is thus I will always treat my enemies and yours, Duke, however	331.86511328637357
high they may be placed, and whatever peril I may incur in acting	333.78395573245894
severely toward them.”	305.1969106820251
“The queen is my enemy, but is not yours, sire; on the contrary, she is	233.11563799415245
a devoted, submissive, and irreproachable wife. Allow me, then, sire,	330.6641363331967
to intercede for her with your Majesty.”	209.71642549506075
“Let her humble herself, then, and come to me first.”	214.15782339440824
“On the contrary, sire, set the example. You have committed the first	271.67020330707925
wrong, since it was you who suspected the queen.”	351.9114726569993
“What! I make the first advances?” said the king. “Never!”	250.89015774502218
“Sire, I entreat you to do so.”	260.4773198182629
“Besides, in what manner can I make advances first?”	203.3383070771996
“By doing a thing which you know will be agreeable to her.”	303.6450727571643
“What is that?”	206.51184971541653
“Give a ball; you know how much the queen loves dancing. I will answer	252.30980392115305
for it, her resentment will not hold out against such an attention.”	222.14839309406085
“Monsieur Cardinal, you know that I do not like worldly pleasures.”	188.57111063628662
“The queen will only be the more grateful to you, as she knows your	168.90631452279183
antipathy for that amusement; besides, it will be an opportunity for	175.3971490099852
her to wear those beautiful diamonds which you gave her recently on her	206.4563344664127
birthday and with which she has since had no occasion to adorn	315.59362712079843
herself.”	188.8575997896798
“We shall see, Monsieur Cardinal, we shall see,” said the king, who, in	256.5914632534333
his joy at finding the queen guilty of a crime which he cared little	169.7552725305025
about, and innocent of a fault of which he had great dread, was ready	211.07727405320287
to make up all differences with her, “we shall see, but upon my honor,	241.42806682564822
you are too indulgent toward her.”	189.01184206543448
“Sire,” said the cardinal, “leave severity to your ministers. Clemency	319.3476200290821
is a royal virtue; employ it, and you will find that you derive	358.2641837688149
advantage therein.”	186.3840629389746
Thereupon the cardinal, hearing the clock strike eleven, bowed low,	206.06380864749707
asking permission of the king to retire, and supplicating him to come	185.79420016353748
to a good understanding with the queen.	227.379768276427
Anne of Austria, who, in consequence of the seizure of her letter,	274.8901726072414
expected reproaches, was much astonished the next day to see the king	273.68820110396723
make some attempts at reconciliation with her. Her first movement was	205.6468849828041
repellent. Her womanly pride and her queenly dignity had both been so	253.6029773793813
cruelly offended that she could not come round at the first advance;	232.7690485350064
but, overpersuaded by the advice of her women, she at last had the	213.7047785101921
appearance of beginning to forget. The king took advantage of this	197.03733985431435
favorable moment to tell her that he had the intention of shortly	352.1315266639925
giving a fête.	354.39522955161465
A fête was so rare a thing for poor Anne of Austria that at this	176.06925763487166
announcement, as the cardinal had predicted, the last trace of her	288.834329467322
resentment disappeared, if not from her heart, at least from her	229.72708623428844
countenance. She asked upon what day this fête would take place, but	239.44406610448797
the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head.	285.22453598461436
Indeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fête should	341.00337342064364
take place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred	202.290988614145
fixing it. Ten days passed away thus.	201.85674157571023
On the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal	248.52824137129346
received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these	257.730978661661
lines: “I have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money.	364.42200636187795
Send me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have	229.58887437740998
received them I shall be in Paris.”	304.17533470687926
On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his	200.8033477491478
customary question to him.	227.16807166514678
Richelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, “She will	231.88694485217815
arrive, she says, four or five days after having received the money. It	304.77988633496136
will require four or five days for the transmission of the money, four	312.97147569395474
or five days for her to return; that makes ten days. Now, allowing for	329.5870344556711
contrary winds, accidents, and a woman’s weakness, there are twelve	221.75683403479965
days.”	196.3454038161401
“Well, Monsieur Duke,” said the king, “have you made your	284.2972814758132
calculations?”	216.7139953030878
“Yes, sire. Today is the twentieth of September. The aldermen of the	296.02240499306424
city give a fête on the third of October. That will fall in wonderfully	229.3702087398187
well; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the	298.6658903740853
queen.”	300.0993704191379
Then the cardinal added, “_A propos_, sire, do not forget to tell her	182.12802431547
Majesty the evening before the fête that you should like to see how her	360.48899511461434
diamond studs become her.”	225.59866531045833
Chapter XVII.	313.796344179034
BONACIEUX AT HOME	268.8140369954216
It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs	212.7532144159297
to the king. Louis XIII. was struck with this insistence, and began to	322.56370134608926
fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery.	298.57625700578956
More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose	201.6655686673033
police, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern	319.40648472996656
police, were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon	218.02083777143818
what was going on in his own household. He hoped, then, in a	292.8108087768344
conversation with Anne of Austria, to obtain some information from that	260.6663456643636
conversation, and afterward to come upon his Eminence with some secret	260.6800575867867
which the cardinal either knew or did not know, but which, in either	347.19006116742037
case, would raise him infinitely in the eyes of his minister.	264.2318688161443
He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with	259.90557592787127
fresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered	326.5585544967364
her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that	281.78501609210986
it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII. meant. Louis	266.17487040243225
XIII. wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break,	224.30985487391166
convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was	332.99516657938614
preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence	226.81744984028316
was so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his	264.39148299611884
persistence in accusation.	357.1532294887845
“But,” cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, “but, sire,	189.7565064199484
you do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done,	324.03913575151967
then? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that	321.71782496434014
your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my	331.09148287954446
brother.”	214.56013370592146
The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer;	337.08268341890755
and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which	211.4093036324244
he was not going to have made until the evening before the fête.	200.33341523352615
“Madame,” said he, with dignity, “there will shortly be a ball at the	312.45128975145127
Hôtel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you	207.11063204657034
should appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the	170.4967401982128
diamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.”	319.678931335279
The answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII. knew	230.6525107435653
all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long	195.4160710414556
dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was	289.6951608178872
characteristic. She became excessively pale, leaned her beautiful hand	287.462408996055
upon a _console_, which hand appeared then like one of wax, and looking	206.11757450634173
at the king with terror in her eyes, she was unable to reply by a	181.3161887675899
single syllable.	177.60065219967882
“You hear, madame,” said the king, who enjoyed the embarrassment to its	239.62511232121926
full extent, but without guessing the cause. “You hear, madame?”	196.58200435049412
“Yes, sire, I hear,” stammered the queen.	208.27405836618632
“You will appear at this ball?”	299.2220089477989
“Yes.”	248.05465987384457
“With those studs?”	344.22796512031823
“Yes.”	331.6939445408955
The queen’s paleness, if possible, increased; the king perceived it,	298.7312679605735
and enjoyed it with that cold cruelty which was one of the worst sides	323.6443752594421
of his character.	262.2597261163644
“Then that is agreed,” said the king, “and that is all I had to say to	252.04104853673516
you.”	305.2572855800605
“But on what day will this ball take place?” asked Anne of Austria.	358.8421684625574
Louis XIII. felt instinctively that he ought not to reply to this	245.04568406635332
question, the queen having put it in an almost dying voice.	353.45601012887494
“Oh, very shortly, madame,” said he; “but I do not precisely recollect	268.55400481460276
the date of the day. I will ask the cardinal.”	206.8514094566182
“It was the cardinal, then, who informed you of this fête?”	276.3011803635093
“Yes, madame,” replied the astonished king; “but why do you ask that?”	341.88448001134134
“It was he who told you to invite me to appear with these studs?”	270.53811444801596
“That is to say, madame—”	189.9758418472886
“It was he, sire, it was he!”	282.2090041951485
“Well, and what does it signify whether it was he or I? Is there any	309.7784728237399
crime in this request?”	230.7814702559548
“No, sire.”	184.71944250378488
“Then you will appear?”	359.3223243040085
“Yes, sire.”	262.12671954280364
“That is well,” said the king, retiring, “that is well; I count upon	339.01764434950843
it.”	344.75545027463266
The queen made a curtsy, less from etiquette than because her knees	252.39316292557498
were sinking under her. The king went away enchanted.	215.2477485082988
“I am lost,” murmured the queen, “lost!—for the cardinal knows all, and	209.13093152941786
it is he who urges on the king, who as yet knows nothing but will soon	277.25635330901815
know everything. I am lost! My God, my God, my God!”	294.6512608409685
She knelt upon a cushion and prayed, with her head buried between her	277.2912474048182
palpitating arms.	232.90813508254973
In fact, her position was terrible. Buckingham had returned to London;	265.9990678640891
Mme. de Chevreuse was at Tours. More closely watched than ever, the	309.9574275918798
queen felt certain, without knowing how to tell which, that one of her	197.2370780796187
women had betrayed her. Laporte could not leave the Louvre; she had not	340.28407077206805
a soul in the world in whom she could confide. Thus, while	361.3899326985504
contemplating the misfortune which threatened her and the abandonment	247.02571305186092
in which she was left, she broke out into sobs and tears.	243.9905089672235
“Can I be of service to your Majesty?” said all at once a voice full of	282.33142386297004
sweetness and pity.	346.08072074597607
The queen turned sharply round, for there could be no deception in the	204.40161764509713
expression of that voice; it was a friend who spoke thus.	184.81796726544997
In fact, at one of the doors which opened into the queen’s apartment	279.2124914068842
appeared the pretty Mme. Bonacieux. She had been engaged in arranging	310.89828989125533
the dresses and linen in a closet when the king entered; she could not	267.2299506756565
get out and had heard all.	249.39293357454005
The queen uttered a piercing cry at finding herself surprised—for in	348.04376497359397
her trouble she did not at first recognize the young woman who had been	327.5491456892578
given to her by Laporte.	251.24158083137655
“Oh, fear nothing, madame!” said the young woman, clasping her hands	276.4206636707974
and weeping herself at the queen’s sorrows; “I am your Majesty’s, body	172.89824690601566
and soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my	230.14970643003483
position, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your	196.9745600669281
Majesty from your trouble.”	200.66451578220514
“You, oh, heaven, you!” cried the queen; “but look me in the face. I am	172.98162684658217
betrayed on all sides. Can I trust in you?”	170.62597589084763
“Oh, madame!” cried the young woman, falling on her knees; “upon my	169.2985390397681
soul, I am ready to die for your Majesty!”	213.44822650702872
This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the	361.686130644806
first, there was no mistaking it.	274.59645171396176
“Yes,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “yes, there are traitors here; but by	277.2042713353807
the holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to	364.54336392929224
your Majesty than I am. Those studs which the king speaks of, you gave	262.5511391373854
them to the Duke of Buckingham, did you not? Those studs were enclosed	296.73404353570925
in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm? Am I deceived? Is	333.8166247512646
it not so, madame?”	338.31107289297745
“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured the queen, whose teeth chattered with	333.11521288650033
fright.	278.23390787396204
“Well, those studs,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “we must have them back	347.59244114817545
again.”	351.51987539907236
“Yes, without doubt, it is necessary,” cried the queen; “but how am I	325.46772469308314
to act? How can it be effected?”	207.19412674974004
“Someone must be sent to the duke.”	255.38194670107194
“But who, who? In whom can I trust?”	167.92279724325172
“Place confidence in me, madame; do me that honor, my queen, and I will	171.54321028152572
find a messenger.”	220.90482493644907
“But I must write.”	317.87021501719244
“Oh, yes; that is indispensable. Two words from the hand of your	323.82733339787205
Majesty and your private seal.”	329.24921130027565
“But these two words would bring about my condemnation, divorce,	329.40666615103635
exile!”	235.7590409190261
“Yes, if they fell into infamous hands. But I will answer for these two	173.36820041652507
words being delivered to their address.”	258.03257467543636
“Oh, my God! I must then place my life, my honor, my reputation, in	299.1859315071931
your hands?”	350.3395604564739
“Yes, yes, madame, you must; and I will save them all.”	257.17266938079126
“But how? Tell me at least the means.”	344.87842646647596
“My husband had been at liberty these two or three days. I have not yet	298.40090085532734
had time to see him again. He is a worthy, honest man who entertains	331.90833011164375
neither love nor hatred for anybody. He will do anything I wish. He	306.8621636965981
will set out upon receiving an order from me, without knowing what he	319.1964340277566
carries, and he will carry your Majesty’s letter, without even knowing	242.8510546924049
it is from your Majesty, to the address which is on it.”	196.63518182646698
The queen took the two hands of the young woman with a burst of	218.15397058672863
emotion, gazed at her as if to read her very heart, and, seeing nothing	225.5109952426546
but sincerity in her beautiful eyes, embraced her tenderly.	261.0530174937931
“Do that,” cried she, “and you will have saved my life, you will have	223.40589163127945
saved my honor!”	312.6533260975144
“Do not exaggerate the service I have the happiness to render your	360.9484057996388
Majesty. I have nothing to save for your Majesty; you are only the	222.10888029264967
victim of perfidious plots.”	303.809967038226
“That is true, that is true, my child,” said the queen, “you are	252.5625173278275
right.”	283.1871696633409
“Give me then, that letter, madame; time presses.”	282.4463663361857
The queen ran to a little table, on which were ink, paper, and pens.	323.60929953767123
She wrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave	351.5589073432892
it to Mme. Bonacieux.	182.86228877647275
“And now,” said the queen, “we are forgetting one very necessary	184.04043629962305
thing.”	322.724047242713
“What is that, madame?”	230.55684671573331
“Money.”	169.03248795918975
Mme. Bonacieux blushed.	348.7013647298548
“Yes, that is true,” said she, “and I will confess to your Majesty that	245.90059058168185
my husband—”	228.3655943417662
“Your husband has none. Is that what you would say?”	257.09233261412237
“He has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault.	279.69502644896727
Nevertheless, let not your Majesty be uneasy, we will find means.”	276.60557390137694
“And I have none, either,” said the queen. Those who have read the	234.90057189121381
_Memoirs_ of Mme. de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply.	342.8991816072132
“But wait a minute.”	237.46698493315267
Anne of Austria ran to her jewel case.	291.8180294730554
“Here,” said she, “here is a ring of great value, as I have been	192.9270561075688
assured. It came from my brother, the King of Spain. It is mine, and I	261.4043108053445
am at liberty to dispose of it. Take this ring; raise money with it,	171.3165306018374
and let your husband set out.”	242.04306243254257
“In an hour you shall be obeyed.”	286.07742765925127
“You see the address,” said the queen, speaking so low that Mme.	308.8869923174235
Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said, “To my Lord Duke of	309.241433807808
Buckingham, London.”	199.56564760430504
“The letter shall be given to himself.”	222.17011421821576
“Generous girl!” cried Anne of Austria.	350.1967747756223
Mme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in	173.0213800948144
the bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird.	357.5627193735056
Ten minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had	288.5293079480407
not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the	315.2233963080098
change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal—a	220.1361776953143
change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from	266.16178736037836
the Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux,	344.8363263251051
and had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable	294.1843370757282
sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only	341.91505999929996
a political precaution.	192.20508145142858
She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with	270.3996386895313
difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the	289.47422448787495
furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied—justice not being one	273.7147487965258
of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of	309.8952467866652
their passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her	326.51854227525246
master’s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that	178.912989669765
she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her	328.3169870618983
native place.	222.3357950493723
The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed	268.96171956250845
his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by	312.2365813407921
congratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could	320.0652338542202
steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit.	301.2472911982145
This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other	166.75149899507204
circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he	282.97936824749684
had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits	250.7211556502782
Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody	311.3860753344258
knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.	221.00217827557145
This was the more so because Bonacieux’s reflections were all	343.8721543753259
rose-colored. Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and	213.9702122883109
never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him.	235.64485992904474
The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and	312.0104205482187
fortune.	294.8707663174815
On her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be	194.29708758018756
admitted, upon something widely different from ambition. In spite of	300.0403351110108
herself her thoughts constantly reverted to that handsome young man who	246.80672232544907
was so brave and appeared to be so much in love. Married at eighteen to	324.3726570770656
M. Bonacieux, having always lived among her husband’s friends—people	274.7008088478061
little capable of inspiring any sentiment whatever in a young woman	323.24165749078645
whose heart was above her position—Mme. Bonacieux had remained	314.030198770253
insensible to vulgar seductions; but at this period the title of	225.30368429007075
gentleman had great influence with the citizen class, and D’Artagnan	173.34841315813085
was a gentleman. Besides, he wore the uniform of the Guards, which,	292.5515972817992
next to that of the Musketeers, was most admired by the ladies. He was,	356.1215254328272
we repeat, handsome, young, and bold; he spoke of love like a man who	281.9438284547
did love and was anxious to be loved in return. There was certainly	236.76401454440963
enough in all this to turn a head only twenty-three years old, and Mme.	294.8125291949965
Bonacieux had just attained that happy period of life.	167.33229973685053
The couple, then, although they had not seen each other for eight days,	174.41801801917367
and during that time serious events had taken place in which both were	342.4436739392113
concerned, accosted each other with a degree of preoccupation.	171.9155563231584
Nevertheless, Bonacieux manifested real joy, and advanced toward his	171.9166157282829
wife with open arms. Madame Bonacieux presented her cheek to him.	328.90568913407634
“Let us talk a little,” said she.	318.37138797052734
“How!” said Bonacieux, astonished.	288.67891525306766
“Yes, I have something of the highest importance to tell you.”	252.1644160605656
“True,” said he, “and I have some questions sufficiently serious to put	228.01162479988153
to you. Describe to me your abduction, I pray you.”	267.59974796108287
“Oh, that’s of no consequence just now,” said Mme. Bonacieux.	331.89776148832215
“And what does it concern, then—my captivity?”	264.4193353288283
“I heard of it the day it happened; but as you were not guilty of any	358.47971732097454
crime, as you were not guilty of any intrigue, as you, in short, knew	328.3864839770364
nothing that could compromise yourself or anybody else, I attached no	233.425994359992
more importance to that event than it merited.”	256.2808387286004
“You speak very much at your ease, madame,” said Bonacieux, hurt at the	346.66279195278764
little interest his wife showed in him. “Do you know that I was plunged	182.677787779115
during a day and night in a dungeon of the Bastille?”	235.5686368091482
“Oh, a day and night soon pass away. Let us return to the object that	364.1026211727058
brings me here.”	332.6434778432879
“What, that which brings you home to me? Is it not the desire of seeing	254.37147597936973
a husband again from whom you have been separated for a week?” asked	291.56781941332605
the mercer, piqued to the quick.	197.28824585162755
“Yes, that first, and other things afterward.”	271.2486763891309
“Speak.”	270.4271990409313
“It is a thing of the highest interest, and upon which our future	261.32597384874737
fortune perhaps depends.”	236.85824647003867
“The complexion of our fortune has changed very much since I saw you,	171.0229817464088
Madame Bonacieux, and I should not be astonished if in the course of a	326.981571452148
few months it were to excite the envy of many folks.”	203.87404308810062
“Yes, particularly if you follow the instructions I am about to give	297.3585352758075
you.”	196.4109247071681
“Me?”	324.9623055492476
“Yes, you. There is good and holy action to be performed, monsieur, and	181.83045837992674
much money to be gained at the same time.”	192.74992717160086
Mme. Bonacieux knew that in talking of money to her husband, she took	246.02567892179687
him on his weak side. But a man, were he even a mercer, when he had	167.51316383154773
talked for ten minutes with Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer the same	249.08669962933652
man.	174.1918571331588
“Much money to be gained?” said Bonacieux, protruding his lip.	185.6067749124285
“Yes, much.”	315.7923522931352
“About how much?”	252.61158866428974
“A thousand pistoles, perhaps.”	245.6210417029585
“What you demand of me is serious, then?”	334.55988867653264
“It is indeed.”	172.01224836205049
“What must be done?”	260.71517102574427
“You must go away immediately. I will give you a paper which you must	255.07957885557585
not part with on any account, and which you will deliver into the	283.9649528929499
proper hands.”	336.50961564507253
“And whither am I to go?”	290.41450806517514
“To London.”	185.56340716797556
“I go to London? Go to! You jest! I have no business in London.”	245.37250822883055
“But others wish that you should go there.”	328.4505213091894
“But who are those others? I warn you that I will never again work in	318.7349106814886
the dark, and that I will know not only to what I expose myself, but	195.1979224538279
for whom I expose myself.”	260.47737165881534
“An illustrious person sends you; an illustrious person awaits you. The	225.45396463280127
recompense will exceed your expectations; that is all I promise you.”	296.3964289885074
“More intrigues! Nothing but intrigues! Thank you, madame, I am aware	198.08897360665844
of them now; Monsieur Cardinal has enlightened me on that head.”	307.99633066865476
“The cardinal?” cried Mme. Bonacieux. “Have you seen the cardinal?”	346.151988130994
“He sent for me,” answered the mercer, proudly.	189.70077955418282
“And you responded to his bidding, you imprudent man?”	257.709635880791
“Well, I can’t say I had much choice of going or not going, for I was	259.5579988693885
taken to him between two guards. It is true also, that as I did not	228.5355632207366
then know his Eminence, if I had been able to dispense with the visit,	231.73111587794057
I should have been enchanted.”	313.69627069132184
“He ill-treated you, then; he threatened you?”	210.73847101236805
“He gave me his hand, and called me his friend. His friend! Do you hear	188.42901184443997
that, madame? I am the friend of the great cardinal!”	322.9920090178124
“Of the great cardinal!”	278.3238216721766
“Perhaps you would contest his right to that title, madame?”	196.6514071316103
“I would contest nothing; but I tell you that the favor of a minister	334.2368977994415
is ephemeral, and that a man must be mad to attach himself to a	207.35354563704186
minister. There are powers above his which do not depend upon a man or	262.8503377655344
the issue of an event; it is to these powers we should rally.”	350.71970457983093
“I am sorry for it, madame, but I acknowledge no other power but that	313.72932983494854
of the great man whom I have the honor to serve.”	178.9108995836561
“You serve the cardinal?”	360.8368383860886
“Yes, madame; and as his servant, I will not allow you to be concerned	254.55325210716666
in plots against the safety of the state, or to serve the intrigues of	243.3931781952552
a woman who is not French and who has a Spanish heart. Fortunately we	343.54071580337256
have the great cardinal; his vigilant eye watches over and penetrates	310.6919721879544
to the bottom of the heart.”	196.47425327534916
Bonacieux was repeating, word for word, a sentence which he had heard	365.51004911186874
from the Comte de Rochefort; but the poor wife, who had reckoned on her	201.92745742096176
husband, and who, in that hope, had answered for him to the queen, did	299.37585597782794
not tremble the less, both at the danger into which she had nearly cast	354.22044913184993
herself and at the helpless state to which she was reduced.	342.1576003865624
Nevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more	283.30371550648897
particularly his cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to	169.4278131909173
her purpose.	219.66570174659924
“Ah, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?” cried she; “and	281.76365736940056
you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your	363.58532642177227
queen?”	216.0036192796469
“Private interests are as nothing before the interests of all. I am for	191.17532004325435
those who save the state,” said Bonacieux, emphatically.	182.53900241894755
“And what do you know about the state you talk of?” said Mme.	264.0965828220043
Bonacieux, shrugging her shoulders. “Be satisfied with being a plain,	338.32257990796694
straightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most	327.56719373920583
advantages.”	207.6551231387389
“Eh, eh!” said Bonacieux, slapping a plump, round bag, which returned	332.92353798112435
of sound a money; “what do you think of this, Madame Preacher?”	260.59291183515654
“Whence comes that money?”	229.9956828755076
“You do not guess?”	166.63823679428882
“From the cardinal?”	181.049945996053
“From him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.”	317.83542558979815
“The Comte de Rochefort! Why, it was he who carried me off!”	281.25432243707724
“That may be, madame!”	323.88774299477325
“And you receive silver from that man?”	185.98539129387473
“Have you not said that that abduction was entirely political?”	263.0509564890634
“Yes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my	358.9580013659802
mistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise	337.8344290259545
the honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.”	254.42700847013947
“Madame,” replied Bonacieux, “your august mistress is a perfidious	317.40730136698505
Spaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.”	286.748905099328
“Monsieur,” said the young woman, “I know you to be cowardly,	228.2713596684528
avaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!”	312.41498409902624
“Madame,” said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and	266.0450995026939
who recoiled before this conjugal anger, “madame, what do you say?”	341.5715258796437
“I say you are a miserable creature!” continued Mme. Bonacieux, who saw	297.46415875205685
she was regaining some little influence over her husband. “You meddle	356.4199963753583
with politics, do you—and still more, with cardinalist politics? Why,	258.702186726391
you sell yourself, body and soul, to the demon, the devil, for money!”	248.11879960208574
“No, to the cardinal.”	187.37510715041944
“It’s the same thing,” cried the young woman. “Who calls Richelieu	322.6201892687591
calls Satan.”	270.67749308369304
“Hold your tongue, hold your tongue, madame! You may be overheard.”	260.6210664664294
“Yes, you are right; I should be ashamed for anyone to know your	288.1855018508104
baseness.”	340.43678671798136
“But what do you require of me, then? Let us see.”	324.47182288847443
“I have told you. You must depart instantly, monsieur. You must	173.89226884846525
accomplish loyally the commission with which I deign to charge you, and	216.49779502265994
on that condition I pardon everything, I forget everything; and what is	271.5223064800257
more,” and she held out her hand to him, “I restore my love.”	193.71003991510526
Bonacieux was cowardly and avaricious, but he loved his wife. He was	285.10383912172773
softened. A man of fifty cannot long bear malice with a wife of	341.25425312361176
twenty-three. Mme. Bonacieux saw that he hesitated.	316.3579327014928
“Come! Have you decided?” said she.	229.90882147809398
“But, my dear love, reflect a little upon what you require of me.	269.8736920758023
London is far from Paris, very far, and perhaps the commission with	170.02043240984395
which you charge me is not without dangers?”	300.1100746423374
“What matters it, if you avoid them?”	199.03146847657703
“Hold, Madame Bonacieux,” said the mercer, “hold! I positively refuse;	166.48268006462172
intrigues terrify me. I have seen the Bastille. My! Whew! That’s a	248.1920244757547
frightful place, that Bastille! Only to think of it makes my flesh	322.9392358586672
crawl. They threatened me with torture. Do you know what torture is?	359.673599827428
Wooden points that they stick in between your legs till your bones	341.8227312157844
stick out! No, positively I will not go. And, _morbleu_, why do you not	214.2354925427154
go yourself? For in truth, I think I have hitherto been deceived in	288.10989898242894
you. I really believe you are a man, and a violent one, too.”	190.92796621266567
“And you, you are a woman—a miserable woman, stupid and brutal. You are	340.61365479682826
afraid, are you? Well, if you do not go this very instant, I will have	197.72023061362032
you arrested by the queen’s orders, and I will have you placed in the	336.21499609436194
Bastille which you dread so much.”	235.21623860314838
Bonacieux fell into a profound reflection. He weighed the two angers in	222.41851399925596
his brain—that of the cardinal and that of the queen; that of the	236.193175606845
cardinal predominated enormously.	170.32905546189417
“Have me arrested on the part of the queen,” said he, “and I—I will	305.78008358070247
appeal to his Eminence.”	236.94042288407593
At once Mme. Bonacieux saw that she had gone too far, and she was	237.17986835974034
terrified at having communicated so much. She for a moment contemplated	175.5185616542451
with fright that stupid countenance, impressed with the invincible	206.17188790760304
resolution of a fool that is overcome by fear.	198.99850484662517
“Well, be it so!” said she. “Perhaps, when all is considered, you are	313.1973054741022
right. In the long run, a man knows more about politics than a woman,	193.3056214704493
particularly such as, like you, Monsieur Bonacieux, have conversed with	305.02680844524605
the cardinal. And yet it is very hard,” added she, “that a man upon	204.0170354299875
whose affection I thought I might depend, treats me thus unkindly and	251.9046613558171
will not comply with any of my fancies.”	269.56356639204125
“That is because your fancies go too far,” replied the triumphant	206.5702492703501
Bonacieux, “and I mistrust them.”	345.4070571860077
“Well, I will give it up, then,” said the young woman, sighing. “It is	293.24907451551275
well as it is; say no more about it.”	333.26409950887125
“At least you should tell me what I should have to do in London,”	252.56442849598469
replied Bonacieux, who remembered a little too late that Rochefort had	265.6196477056143
desired him to endeavor to obtain his wife’s secrets.	359.77626294540227
“It is of no use for you to know anything about it,” said the young	346.2554062838342
woman, whom an instinctive mistrust now impelled to draw back. “It was	340.2815894703584
about one of those purchases that interest women—a purchase by which	170.27364038181406
much might have been gained.”	252.02901030635007
But the more the young woman excused herself, the more important	217.92857877119246
Bonacieux thought the secret which she declined to confide to him. He	336.3226068619888
resolved then to hasten immediately to the residence of the Comte de	166.5318419748045
Rochefort, and tell him that the queen was seeking for a messenger to	224.4670613777817
send to London.	274.41255548070717
“Pardon me for quitting you, my dear Madame Bonacieux,” said he; “but,	192.85289081821335
not knowing you would come to see me, I had made an engagement with a	341.6342659882115
friend. I shall soon return; and if you will wait only a few minutes	171.3108545508288
for me, as soon as I have concluded my business with that friend, as it	209.0796494373445
is growing late, I will come back and reconduct you to the Louvre.”	360.88792091643654
“Thank you, monsieur, you are not brave enough to be of any use to me	316.78088545893775
whatever,” replied Mme. Bonacieux. “I shall return very safely to the	341.95343508879006
Louvre all alone.”	314.71594235132966
“As you please, Madame Bonacieux,” said the ex-mercer. “Shall I see you	328.1809527969495
again soon?”	222.69456852247683
“Next week I hope my duties will afford me a little liberty, and I will	258.6235039613934
take advantage of it to come and put things in order here, as they must	310.3486769881607
necessarily be much deranged.”	259.40113048676494
“Very well; I shall expect you. You are not angry with me?”	209.36776415181114
“Not the least in the world.”	292.79152387923347
“Till then, then?”	336.39786771801766
“Till then.”	247.8372140781904
Bonacieux kissed his wife’s hand, and set off at a quick pace.	176.59197579908798
“Well,” said Mme. Bonacieux, when her husband had shut the street door	313.2164450918118
and she found herself alone; “that imbecile lacked but one thing: to	269.4878262383192
become a cardinalist. And I, who have answered for him to the queen—I,	251.3309082208265
who have promised my poor mistress—ah, my God, my God! She will take me	275.62506697823744
for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are	346.21557481728473
placed about her as spies! Ah, Monsieur Bonacieux, I never did love you	297.8395602700501
much, but now it is worse than ever. I hate you, and on my word you	279.3663960082822
shall pay for this!”	281.3616947759463
At the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise	353.57688064720804
her head, and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried,	292.0169343992401
“Dear Madame Bonacieux, open for me the little door on the alley, and I	217.16325597611586
will come down to you.”	333.96416417285775
Chapter XVIII.	311.22415868490293
LOVER AND HUSBAND	332.4796582898746
Ah, Madame,” said D’Artagnan, entering by the door which the young	236.8378732401138
woman opened for him, “allow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of	258.2213850182741
a husband.”	234.13425980373745
“You have, then, overheard our conversation?” asked Mme. Bonacieux,	240.4235861375522
eagerly, and looking at D’Artagnan with disquiet.	278.6712091070406
“The whole.”	207.69440418442417
“But how, my God?”	175.415036487302
“By a mode of proceeding known to myself, and by which I likewise	168.62997846337868
overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the	198.51614802034166
cardinal’s police.”	257.2638806440577
“And what did you understand by what we said?”	312.8416324414843
“A thousand things. In the first place, that, unfortunately, your	174.7113231041572
husband is a simpleton and a fool; in the next place, you are in	280.8244157444799
trouble, of which I am very glad, as it gives me an opportunity of	360.7755636466004
placing myself at your service, and God knows I am ready to throw	358.0654760791199
myself into the fire for you; finally, that the queen wants a brave,	220.9558838809381
intelligent, devoted man to make a journey to London for her. I have at	320.86673693900076
least two of the three qualities you stand in need of, and here I am.”	203.09292716595948
Mme. Bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret	206.57309348751966
hope shone in her eyes.	333.916731526015
“And what guarantee will you give me,” asked she, “if I consent to	212.10394554895015
confide this message to you?”	285.44807614244786
“My love for you. Speak! Command! What is to be done?”	174.06151104553808
“My God, my God!” murmured the young woman, “ought I to confide such a	281.3916029441103
secret to you, monsieur? You are almost a boy.”	241.18397879971968
“I see that you require someone to answer for me?”	260.7230261044653
“I admit that would reassure me greatly.”	296.15608876376086
“Do you know Athos?”	355.40578618657656
“No.”	313.7632694246141
“Porthos?”	363.06511809400195
“No.”	182.4892881548467
“Aramis?”	222.75642450044177
“No. Who are these gentleman?”	189.7108252454459
“Three of the king’s Musketeers. Do you know Monsieur de Tréville,	333.90447681708076
their captain?”	341.1459881779243
“Oh, yes, him! I know him; not personally, but from having heard the	268.65889849639063
queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman.”	172.68909914360063
“You do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?”	339.359007994631
“Oh, no, certainly not!”	324.42921034550386
“Well, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however	322.0949766188112
important, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not	336.3551154674718
confide it to me.”	314.1172059845232
“But this secret is not mine, and I cannot reveal it in this manner.”	253.93886108803258
“You were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan,	199.961153831695
with chagrin.	252.3356724103516
“As one confides a letter to the hollow of a tree, to the wing of a	253.828138285497
pigeon, to the collar of a dog.”	226.35246607495424
“And yet, me—you see plainly that I love you.”	273.95707802292696
“You say so.”	273.35747823116066
“I am an honorable man.”	313.88155130575603
“You say so.”	269.5912842361323
“I am a gallant fellow.”	354.38487402174405
“I believe it.”	290.79621310439603
“I am brave.”	237.83807411575054
“Oh, I am sure of that!”	300.7379957619804
“Then, put me to the proof.”	203.7504967179526
Mme. Bonacieux looked at the young man, restrained for a minute by a	234.02166451665448
last hesitation; but there was such an ardor in his eyes, such	333.6693789993051
persuasion in his voice, that she felt herself constrained to confide	271.03390390517825
in him. Besides, she found herself in circumstances where everything	255.17281745313832
must be risked for the sake of everything. The queen might be as much	315.3878487828579
injured by too much reticence as by too much confidence; and—let us	211.31554400606163
admit it—the involuntary sentiment which she felt for her young	357.95026750506315
protector decided her to speak.	301.7696653555497
“Listen,” said she; “I yield to your protestations, I yield to your	169.71746877461345
assurances. But I swear to you, before God who hears us, that if you	253.92815112830164
betray me, and my enemies pardon me, I will kill myself, while accusing	306.2740249646229
you of my death.”	254.8322864884041
“And I—I swear to you before God, madame,” said D’Artagnan, “that if I	182.23260789514066
am taken while accomplishing the orders you give me, I will die sooner	331.9932162327831
than do anything that may compromise anyone.”	297.3695709995242
Then the young woman confided in him the terrible secret of which	350.87881927330267
chance had already communicated to him a part in front of the	293.9413189183033
Samaritaine. This was their mutual declaration of love.	222.867145037194
D’Artagnan was radiant with joy and pride. This secret which he	250.06058417283788
possessed, this woman whom he loved! Confidence and love made him a	289.60738768798404
giant.	252.1186378870526
“I go,” said he; “I go at once.”	337.2839814994028
“How, you will go!” said Mme. Bonacieux; “and your regiment, your	194.60964998136163
captain?”	256.95133837366194
“By my soul, you had made me forget all that, dear Constance! Yes, you	225.82932390770756
are right; a furlough is needful.”	307.6917035328079
“Still another obstacle,” murmured Mme. Bonacieux, sorrowfully.	207.74921289244492
“As to that,” cried D’Artagnan, after a moment of reflection, “I shall	260.6787706650817
surmount it, be assured.”	364.2875125519388
“How so?”	222.93149036884887
“I will go this very evening to Tréville, whom I will request to ask	176.2435901253713
this favor for me of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart.”	247.2270951323001
“But another thing.”	324.7115626678502
“What?” asked D’Artagnan, seeing that Mme. Bonacieux hesitated to	223.31350248624972
continue.	277.8133313250256
“You have, perhaps, no money?”	210.07481862110197
“_Perhaps_ is too much,” said D’Artagnan, smiling.	233.6115940759036
“Then,” replied Mme. Bonacieux, opening a cupboard and taking from it	166.50905856146187
the very bag which a half hour before her husband had caressed so	180.16241891154203
affectionately, “take this bag.”	331.0244533971638
“The cardinal’s?” cried D’Artagnan, breaking into a loud laugh, he	338.8029693044185
having heard, as may be remembered, thanks to the broken boards, every	198.37575130608633
syllable of the conversation between the mercer and his wife.	251.00769036932786
“The cardinal’s,” replied Mme. Bonacieux. “You see it makes a very	266.2488532956461
respectable appearance.”	306.2275824281621
“_Pardieu_,” cried D’Artagnan, “it will be a double amusing affair to	178.62121621386808
save the queen with the cardinal’s money!”	247.75404796102643
“You are an amiable and charming young man,” said Mme. Bonacieux. “Be	288.98906943785084
assured you will not find her Majesty ungrateful.”	248.89247407868834
“Oh, I am already grandly recompensed!” cried D’Artagnan. “I love you;	175.60618974521336
you permit me to tell you that I do—that is already more happiness than	269.411358430281
I dared to hope.”	292.2654529002304
“Silence!” said Mme. Bonacieux, starting.	347.5603102604475
“What!”	265.13668194878784
“Someone is talking in the street.”	269.87961924526263
“It is the voice of—”	193.06125523921634
“Of my husband! Yes, I recognize it!”	234.91973768273732
D’Artagnan ran to the door and pushed the bolt.	293.09794047403267
“He shall not come in before I am gone,” said he; “and when I am gone,	359.72457948054296
you can open to him.”	210.5573513286128
“But I ought to be gone, too. And the disappearance of his money; how	228.66169569518505
am I to justify it if I am here?”	209.50930966466296
“You are right; we must go out.”	294.66282133703567
“Go out? How? He will see us if we go out.”	350.67790006051735
“Then you must come up into my room.”	347.7909337490489
“Ah,” said Mme. Bonacieux, “you speak that in a tone that frightens	277.05449713671857
me!”	335.06748614433945
Mme. Bonacieux pronounced these words with tears in her eyes.	304.4181759682827
D’Artagnan saw those tears, and much disturbed, softened, he threw	230.61681859009238
himself at her feet.	316.1026206222178
“With me you will be as safe as in a temple; I give you my word of a	248.813114230264
gentleman.”	287.97634089724585
“Let us go,” said she, “I place full confidence in you, my friend!”	216.70585656137226
D’Artagnan drew back the bolt with precaution, and both, light as	235.76771034341618
shadows, glided through the interior door into the passage, ascended	254.71894852338244
the stairs as quietly as possible, and entered D’Artagnan’s chambers.	191.41891895818995
Once there, for greater security, the young man barricaded the door.	343.71118253918337
They both approached the window, and through a slit in the shutter they	169.2056635831533
saw Bonacieux talking with a man in a cloak.	253.72154787276818
At sight of this man, D’Artagnan started, and half drawing his sword,	278.0277924955311
sprang toward the door.	251.55596269745402
It was the man of Meung.	341.37152305688784
“What are you going to do?” cried Mme. Bonacieux; “you will ruin us	275.23990208909447
all!”	190.7625419578822
“But I have sworn to kill that man!” said D’Artagnan.	188.31921454817672
“Your life is devoted from this moment, and does not belong to you. In	169.7552285377181
the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril	207.18632033140446
which is foreign to that of your journey.”	273.3926059210806
“And do you command nothing in your own name?”	207.94463539437868
“In my name,” said Mme. Bonacieux, with great emotion, “in my name I	243.1403203092009
beg you! But listen; they appear to be speaking of me.”	363.5286755083722
D’Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear.	345.5525638395502
M. Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had	277.8024867500645
returned to the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an	248.63379237603883
instant.	233.85283369937807
“She is gone,” said he; “she must have returned to the Louvre.”	169.49277099850295
“You are sure,” replied the stranger, “that she did not suspect the	280.12295468497655
intentions with which you went out?”	302.9065491772154
“No,” replied Bonacieux, with a self-sufficient air, “she is too	228.0520806717912
superficial a woman.”	243.30256381957219
“Is the young Guardsman at home?”	245.19009251102204
“I do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can	216.6545549266539
see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters.”	199.57358481689346
“All the same, it is well to be certain.”	291.30931657993074
“How so?”	212.1690160842927
“By knocking at his door. Go.”	207.60611834897446
“I will ask his servant.”	216.24075539776436
Bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had	356.02953868676354
afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to D’Artagnan’s door,	360.23420507465147
and knocked.	341.8086066718116
No one answered. Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that	179.9392418981041
evening borrowed Planchet. As to D’Artagnan, he took care not to give	350.6125444822358
the least sign of existence.	308.92138832061903
The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young	289.22338110818254
people felt their hearts bound within them.	191.31862291253634
“There is nobody within,” said Bonacieux.	234.8115241974104
“Never mind. Let us return to your apartment. We shall be safer there	250.66365967506061
than in the doorway.”	176.40597658890593
“Ah, my God!” whispered Mme. Bonacieux, “we shall hear no more.”	324.0555258340237
“On the contrary,” said D’Artagnan, “we shall hear better.”	236.30732282458052
D’Artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber	195.0714050073345
another ear of Dionysius, spread a carpet on the floor, went upon his	299.36234798024714
knees, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the	357.6006738621996
opening.	346.78836323679695
“You are sure there is nobody there?” said the stranger.	284.7200514697202
“I will answer for it,” said Bonacieux.	199.15919743337332
“And you think that your wife—”	208.39853620328932
“Has returned to the Louvre.”	275.11025730130245
“Without speaking to anyone but yourself?”	362.46933851857847
“I am sure of it.”	279.5809801028332
“That is an important point, do you understand?”	244.21416398107442
“Then the news I brought you is of value?”	182.05136924274098
“The greatest, my dear Bonacieux; I don’t conceal this from you.”	208.59844714405892
“Then the cardinal will be pleased with me?”	293.82763099100595
“I have no doubt of it.”	235.8075597989518
“The great cardinal!”	269.23819762867157
“Are you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned	248.2514157801248
no names?”	226.9551154769111
“I think not.”	353.58399399483994
“She did not name Madame de Chevreuse, the Duke of Buckingham, or	186.32295779072896
Madame de Vernet?”	255.98169091888568
“No; she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the	322.8018376794697
interests of an illustrious personage.”	271.50398802466947
“The traitor!” murmured Mme. Bonacieux.	316.72068596141895
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, taking her hand, which, without thinking of	214.1319786510619
it, she abandoned to him.	334.1644838319363
“Never mind,” continued the man in the cloak; “you were a fool not to	292.90294928272095
have pretended to accept the mission. You would then be in present	244.8475253629133
possession of the letter. The state, which is now threatened, would be	259.8065249309191
safe, and you—”	224.5635596712622
“And I?”	170.33691365219016
“Well you—the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility.”	325.3689349099994
“Did he tell you so?”	347.10502876294044
“Yes, I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise.”	344.0817653343592
“Be satisfied,” replied Bonacieux; “my wife adores me, and there is yet	215.70707819273161
time.”	187.54766198915556
“The ninny!” murmured Mme. Bonacieux.	196.93724952215433
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, pressing her hand more closely.	254.46104009519723
“How is there still time?” asked the man in the cloak.	322.1231947647083
“I go to the Louvre; I ask for Mme. Bonacieux; I say that I have	172.48312425260596
reflected; I renew the affair; I obtain the letter, and I run directly	285.1067384051781
to the cardinal.”	192.8013218791454
“Well, go quickly! I will return soon to learn the result of your	358.22808043860346
trip.”	352.46335960877377
The stranger went out.	285.59885320700056
“Infamous!” said Mme. Bonacieux, addressing this epithet to her	346.8109651527915
husband.	283.0736404655104
“Silence!” said D’Artagnan, pressing her hand still more warmly.	193.16209655010093
A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of D’Artagnan and Mme.	316.40203863907345
Bonacieux. It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of	307.9401943450133
the moneybag, and was crying “Thieves!”	289.31509661521784
“Oh, my God!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “he will rouse the whole quarter.”	360.96915451749487
Bonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their	213.77784823421152
frequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the	166.38151092338455
mercer’s house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out	269.32100117652436
continuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he	314.21997182025086
went in the direction of the Rue du Bac.	342.3822859122612
“Now he is gone, it is your turn to get out,” said Mme. Bonacieux.	190.0095882556347
“Courage, my friend, but above all, prudence, and think what you owe to	359.168257468145
the queen.”	313.5607180433576
“To her and to you!” cried D’Artagnan. “Be satisfied, beautiful	279.8468034766013
Constance. I shall become worthy of her gratitude; but shall I likewise	168.19862379105754
return worthy of your love?”	187.69497573147632
The young woman only replied by the beautiful glow which mounted to her	210.103040115071
cheeks. A few seconds afterward D’Artagnan also went out enveloped in a	346.99314144026846
large cloak, which ill-concealed the sheath of a long sword.	334.64507098660215
Mme. Bonacieux followed him with her eyes, with that long, fond look	285.8288143670342
with which he had turned the angle of the street, she fell on her	351.62827391622966
knees, and clasping her hands, “Oh, my God,” cried she, “protect the	338.14077935490985
queen, protect me!”	355.38901877705075
Chapter XIX.	357.45666490111853
PLAN OF CAMPAIGN	190.5933503864983
D’Artagnan went straight to M. de Tréville’s. He had reflected that in	172.45550768868807
a few minutes the cardinal would be warned by this cursed stranger, who	177.2424076419915
appeared to be his agent, and he judged, with reason, he had not a	291.0375902702897
moment to lose.	224.3667996982577
The heart of the young man overflowed with joy. An opportunity	239.0678030985824
presented itself to him in which there would be at the same time glory	336.7071581777759
to be acquired, and money to be gained; and as a far higher	221.86403270943606
encouragement, it brought him into close intimacy with a woman he	294.0042057944263
adored. This chance did, then, for him at once more than he would have	221.40452518139955
dared to ask of Providence.	344.9081714353907
M. de Tréville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen.	166.11018369775172
D’Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to	365.9467762406227
his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of	346.3778002305848
importance.	183.6734695063312
D’Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Tréville	349.80184099954647
entered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his	225.42872224007914
countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new	290.55396510510695
was on foot.	223.20245604127905
All the way along D’Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether	186.74920600791629
he should place confidence in M. de Tréville, or whether he should only	217.91650453346193
ask him to give him _carte blanche_ for some secret affair. But M. de	244.53518238064137
Tréville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so	298.4408660784944
devoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially,	194.9434225923906
that the young man resolved to tell him everything.	331.95470664753583
“Did you ask for me, my good friend?” said M. de Tréville.	209.64352317618426
“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, lowering his voice, “and you will	326.4818643115543
pardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the	255.658351132413
importance of my business.”	309.72719361151564
“Speak, then, I am all attention.”	206.1954466095312
“It concerns nothing less,” said D’Artagnan, “than the honor, perhaps	294.90231954615354
the life of the queen.”	195.4691999892239
“What did you say?” asked M. de Tréville, glancing round to see if they	216.87180771483077
were surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon	240.97259611591772
D’Artagnan.	288.4420705451657
“I say, monsieur, that chance has rendered me master of a secret—”	356.9172691922865
“Which you will guard, I hope, young man, as your life.”	350.76032252269135
“But which I must impart to you, monsieur, for you alone can assist me	224.7579536020795
in the mission I have just received from her Majesty.”	329.36972083347877
“Is this secret your own?”	347.09904401505
“No, monsieur; it is her Majesty’s.”	340.25391233683644
“Are you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me?”	170.7273510225928
“No, monsieur, for, on the contrary, I am desired to preserve the	345.62942244637253
profoundest mystery.”	206.79201526569295
“Why, then, are you about to betray it to me?”	334.9283198593581
“Because, as I said, without you I can do nothing; and I am afraid you	284.56306795257825
will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I	261.57842342798983
ask it.”	294.2429365541733
“Keep your secret, young man, and tell me what you wish.”	289.94383041916365
“I wish you to obtain for me, from Monsieur Dessessart, leave of	357.0024607851638
absence for fifteen days.”	269.4460877007295
“When?”	204.39521026666333
“This very night.”	267.76176449193247
“You leave Paris?”	322.4760149734741
“I am going on a mission.”	209.83375230648767
“May you tell me whither?”	204.77628093645285
“To London.”	216.91602300848785
“Has anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?”	294.2688764938282
“The cardinal, I believe, would give the world to prevent my success.”	346.56328474840143
“And you are going alone?”	192.2970169357561
“I am going alone.”	284.67353261054706
“In that case you will not get beyond Bondy. I tell you so, by the	364.4284503954638
faith of de Tréville.”	341.4289067339233
“How so?”	240.26459449950428
“You will be assassinated.”	264.6965406751077
“And I shall die in the performance of my duty.”	209.25102121378637
“But your mission will not be accomplished.”	295.27157973217754
“That is true,” replied D’Artagnan.	273.34327576294777
“Believe me,” continued Tréville, “in enterprises of this kind, in	196.76864612041035
order that one may arrive, four must set out.”	254.20163659262468
“Ah, you are right, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “but you know Athos,	238.97495484612074
Porthos, and Aramis, and you know if I can dispose of them.”	352.8114802806533
“Without confiding to them the secret which I am not willing to know?”	213.13298383804536
“We are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness	356.55494323592035
against all proof. Besides, you can tell them that you have full	289.15488959364404
confidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you.”	199.70940525663974
“I can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is	312.7097643173196
all—to Athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters	277.3371139510618
of Forges; to Porthos and Aramis to accompany their friend, whom they	227.46372045240494
are not willing to abandon in such a painful condition. Sending their	351.896750379192
leave of absence will be proof enough that I authorize their journey.”	271.5166348761536
“Thanks, monsieur. You are a hundred times too good.”	349.4646891477267
“Begone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight! Ha!	325.68963440775565
But first write your request to Dessessart. Perhaps you had a spy at	317.6349852681663
your heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal,	257.45967667681685
will thus seem legitimate.”	320.16256475628006
D’Artagnan drew up his request, and M. de Tréville, on receiving it,	252.17681367820927
assured him that by two o’clock in the morning the four leaves of	239.36443905749715
absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers.	309.89345072038543
“Have the goodness to send mine to Athos’s residence. I should dread	168.3428877073134
some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.”	294.74419455042784
“Be easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. _A propos_,” said M. de	304.8456862322781
Tréville, calling him back.	205.36208305422628
D’Artagnan returned.	354.573242414257
“Have you any money?”	273.0475121874031
D’Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.	270.87043787403593
“Enough?” asked M. de Tréville.	333.34619278860237
“Three hundred pistoles.”	345.7944726890253
“Oh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone,	291.76433044002704
then!”	207.94074809522178
D’Artagnan saluted M. de Tréville, who held out his hand to him;	323.65411017761323
D’Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his	337.92865949899783
first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this	332.8596967002454
excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great.	326.0966866909157
His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since	167.1689936188322
the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still	255.02294677588696
further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had	357.4544183882762
seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.	210.78053441046657
This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.	300.92768649359084
D’Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis	222.52191077696608
pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St.	271.08631739675815
Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following	208.76309975422234
week, and which preoccupied him a good deal.	317.2639250272915
After the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from	337.84891412492493
M. de Tréville entered, bringing a sealed packet.	286.6570352022133
“What is that?” asked Aramis.	179.17503083980523
“The leave of absence Monsieur has asked for,” replied the lackey.	236.0184746740194
“For me! I have asked for no leave of absence.”	264.2353243731355
“Hold your tongue and take it!” said D’Artagnan. “And you, my friend,	279.55830450372594
there is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell Monsieur de	299.0207497386445
Tréville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to him. Go.”	284.5615932282507
The lackey bowed to the ground and departed.	301.03241569203385
“What does all this mean?” asked Aramis.	284.78714097862155
“Pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me.”	251.77548678826096
“But I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing—”	246.23389180331662
Aramis stopped.	259.0636964647522
“What is become of her? I suppose you mean—” continued D’Artagnan.	183.70027842688125
“Become of whom?” replied Aramis.	287.7872693144834
“The woman who was here—the woman with the embroidered handkerchief.”	203.3910862010514
“Who told you there was a woman here?” replied Aramis, becoming as pale	234.8073614707984
as death.	359.76677563523793
“I saw her.”	217.7600376745469
“And you know who she is?”	201.75184769742333
“I believe I can guess, at least.”	183.10748283608152
“Listen!” said Aramis. “Since you appear to know so many things, can	284.2961672448266
you tell me what is become of that woman?”	166.53663686425105
“I presume that she has returned to Tours.”	353.9874927053052
“To Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she	314.2148079677407
return to Tours without telling me anything?”	284.8550980653505
“Because she was in fear of being arrested.”	183.48547825660282
“Why has she not written to me, then?”	326.8533199703733
“Because she was afraid of compromising you.”	194.1162874319347
“D’Artagnan, you restore me to life!” cried Aramis. “I fancied myself	336.04037239391084
despised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not	263.91957089273825
have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other	182.85326008645836
cause could she have returned to Paris?”	234.1072460905087
“For the cause which today takes us to England.”	359.6475826163834
“And what is this cause?” demanded Aramis.	268.00801067555733
“Oh, you’ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the	185.0283718409308
discretion of ‘the doctor’s niece.’”	348.5949054454522
Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a	196.0942745956296
certain evening. “Well, then, since she has left Paris, and you are	266.4397757577097
sure of it, D’Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow	243.70387857108824
you. You say we are going—”	195.30615711201966
“To see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make	175.03072978265112
haste, for we have lost much time already. _A propos_, inform Bazin.”	263.08057895610096
“Will Bazin go with us?” asked Aramis.	330.8010790569016
“Perhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to	227.61302081250417
Athos’s.”	355.69617227636127
Aramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at	319.72143237558464
Athos’s residence, said “Let us go then,” at the same time taking his	275.1897962416553
cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers	188.14791675384416
to see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search	303.3919127487871
was superfluous, he followed D’Artagnan, wondering to himself how this	184.2269704404761
young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had	287.58600019782637
given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had	244.82290625371482
become of her.	262.4156603032118
Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of	301.4334851787214
D’Artagnan, and looking at him earnestly, “You have not spoken of this	361.0220349476464
lady?” said he.	279.7199179591559
“To nobody in the world.”	291.8020619115289
“Not even to Athos or Porthos?”	312.04601187518654
“I have not breathed a syllable to them.”	252.61923381468736
“Good enough!”	300.6269230969565
Tranquil on this important point, Aramis continued his way with	291.8381360228392
D’Artagnan, and both soon arrived at Athos’s dwelling. They found him	284.6334239801232
holding his leave of absence in one hand, and M. de Tréville’s note in	178.41209041651868
the other.	229.02591812958195
“Can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this	214.47270262176875
letter, which I have just received?” said the astonished Athos.	315.7190199629674
MY DEAR ATHOS,	218.02215051465998
    I wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you should rest	314.98488134797174
    for a fortnight. Go, then, and take the waters of Forges, or any	258.7211466570485
    that may be more agreeable to you, and recuperate yourself as	308.75561883132923
    quickly as possible.	272.6919422164393
Yours affectionate,	227.31634171322156
DE TRÉVILLE	167.8579429740793
“Well, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow	223.07556989511917
me, Athos.”	257.131479390985
“To the waters of Forges?”	311.3982787802231
“There or elsewhere.”	334.2193479098326
“In the king’s service?”	323.18701704895716
“Either the king’s or the queen’s. Are we not their Majesties’	308.8823359700956
servants?”	187.36714920987907
At that moment Porthos entered. “_Pardieu!_” said he, “here is a	241.66873970606855
strange thing! Since when, I wonder, in the Musketeers, did they grant	221.01036772434972
men leave of absence without their asking for it?”	328.92263996187864
“Since,” said D’Artagnan, “they have friends who ask it for them.”	337.96003964918873
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “it appears there’s something fresh here.”	172.6652708433236
“Yes, we are going—” said Aramis.	307.5486897013463
“To what country?” demanded Porthos.	268.1407780576074
“My faith! I don’t know much about it,” said Athos. “Ask D’Artagnan.”	310.47051296332324
“To London, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan.	186.23164045747006
“To London!” cried Porthos; “and what the devil are we going to do in	236.72202421158067
London?”	326.2748517544071
“That is what I am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must	172.60378512676175
trust to me.”	324.19658757293394
“But in order to go to London,” added Porthos, “money is needed, and I	294.958890834646
have none.”	234.73085416412079
“Nor I,” said Aramis.	167.68826170442878
“Nor I,” said Athos.	334.3603728016516
“I have,” replied D’Artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,	310.9783244991528
and placing it on the table. “There are in this bag three hundred	176.27060100089153
pistoles. Let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to	297.21955748860114
London and back. Besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive	235.04178460703986
at London.”	287.835879218851
“Why so?”	301.43240971730205
“Because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road.”	266.5150234982051
“Is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?”	226.1357941167084
“One of a most dangerous kind, I give you notice.”	336.2897066407073
“Ah! But if we do risk being killed,” said Porthos, “at least I should	214.54858743762418
like to know what for.”	251.92453002071926
“You would be all the wiser,” said Athos.	272.554926861199
“And yet,” said Aramis, “I am somewhat of Porthos’s opinion.”	269.1731040010461
“Is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? No. He says to you	283.9436929106128
jauntily, ‘Gentlemen, there is fighting going on in Gascony or in	334.73936164472406
Flanders; go and fight,’ and you go there. Why? You need give	172.03357023921964
yourselves no more uneasiness about this.”	331.07740885501596
“D’Artagnan is right,” said Athos; “here are our three leaves of	241.84181154494416
absence which came from Monsieur de Tréville, and here are three	226.14194366327928
hundred pistoles which came from I don’t know where. So let us go and	224.684651377283
get killed where we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so	348.5331142617126
many questions? D’Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.”	307.9193020503606
“And I also,” said Porthos.	248.0849651333455
“And I also,” said Aramis. “And, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris;	352.7503282563479
I had need of distraction.”	223.83886477039317
“Well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,” said	235.24120072017053
D’Artagnan.	187.9231425194555
“And, now, when are we to go?” asked Athos.	334.0267250102789
“Immediately,” replied D’Artagnan; “we have not a minute to lose.”	361.4001583605844
“Hello, Grimaud! Planchet! Mousqueton! Bazin!” cried the four young	265.1453828740583
men, calling their lackeys, “clean my boots, and fetch the horses from	224.17673391298405
the hôtel.”	362.07229957878076
Each Musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hôtel, as at a	170.64752204224612
barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. Planchet, Grimaud,	289.2046105984547
Mousqueton, and Bazin set off at full speed.	277.43709105893447
“Now let us lay down the plan of campaign,” said Porthos. “Where do we	187.24429009711872
go first?”	297.6631402335051
“To Calais,” said D’Artagnan; “that is the most direct line to London.”	240.1988940664765
“Well,” said Porthos, “this is my advice—”	307.5618837036835
“Speak!”	217.08308704960658
“Four men traveling together would be suspected. D’Artagnan will give	198.23729538019484
each of us his instructions. I will go by the way of Boulogne to clear	319.9020615153219
the way; Athos will set out two hours after, by that of Amiens; Aramis	278.4905140301747
will follow us by that of Noyon; as to D’Artagnan, he will go by what	283.4282658996706
route he thinks is best, in Planchet’s clothes, while Planchet will	298.1940708735051
follow us like D’Artagnan, in the uniform of the Guards.”	202.24352622615763
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “my opinion is that it is not proper to allow	361.3533561939497
lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. A secret may, by	250.07172686845345
chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by	278.42214128558896
lackeys.”	252.0481366759852
“Porthos’s plan appears to me to be impracticable,” said D’Artagnan,	222.0613908599453
“inasmuch as I am myself ignorant of what instructions I can give you.	190.80675636212308
I am the bearer of a letter, that is all. I have not, and I cannot make	328.3976783553377
three copies of that letter, because it is sealed. We must, then, as it	223.89507508297973
appears to me, travel in company. This letter is here, in this pocket,”	222.4749154575291
and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter. “If I should	173.0167680882842
be killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be	289.6411540124772
killed, it will be another’s turn, and so on—provided a single one	187.71904212340178
arrives, that is all that is required.”	342.1520216092158
“Bravo, D’Artagnan, your opinion is mine,” cried Athos, “Besides, we	206.5947268528114
must be consistent; I am going to take the waters, you will accompany	214.47542636418433
me. Instead of taking the waters of Forges, I go and take sea waters; I	175.94667287970935
am free to do so. If anyone wishes to stop us, I will show Monsieur de	219.25924783060594
Tréville’s letter, and you will show your leaves of absence. If we are	219.0733175800021
attacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly	292.2862873651786
maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of	173.92508600075422
times in the sea. They would have an easy bargain of four isolated men;	216.97074462916035
whereas four men together make a troop. We will arm our four lackeys	266.4881495438033
with pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we	220.46579873919535
will give battle, and the survivor, as D’Artagnan says, will carry the	263.84104123987134
letter.”	257.9695227922448
“Well said,” cried Aramis; “you don’t often speak, Athos, but when you	255.18806016151
do speak, it is like St. John of the Golden Mouth. I agree to Athos’s	362.4387488376234
plan. And you, Porthos?”	326.7240235541075
“I agree to it, too,” said Porthos, “if D’Artagnan approves of it.	365.09966727608844
D’Artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of	271.86268563568797
the enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute.”	232.55219371746642
“Well,” said D’Artagnan, “I decide that we should adopt Athos’s plan,	238.7132728289527
and that we set off in half an hour.”	293.47809456408925
“Agreed!” shouted the three Musketeers in chorus.	287.1317908798516
Each one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five	222.17000439870145
pistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed.	277.81266803499597
Chapter XX.	313.67843669970915
THE JOURNEY	365.2797031355926
At two o’clock in the morning, our four adventurers left Paris by the	245.21156627898762
Barrière St. Denis. As long as it was dark they remained silent; in	286.695999416409
spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity,	341.6798946764291
and apprehended ambushes on every side.	242.5131603946981
With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun	277.062570895568
gaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the	334.058452277951
eyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to	174.7038415136327
lose, was, after all, a good thing.	327.89024292859085
Besides, the appearance of the caravan was formidable. The black horses	282.7600083563138
of the Musketeers, their martial carriage, with the regimental step of	200.4624485669059
these noble companions of the soldier, would have betrayed the most	315.86003562766484
strict incognito. The lackeys followed, armed to the teeth.	207.1673835709776
All went well till they arrived at Chantilly, which they reached about	190.8861279322011
eight o’clock in the morning. They needed breakfast, and alighted at	289.2084509472006
the door of an _auberge_, recommended by a sign representing St. Martin	312.9925669004133
giving half his cloak to a poor man. They ordered the lackeys not to	289.09884854001365
unsaddle the horses, and to hold themselves in readiness to set off	300.7708666322985
again immediately.	219.1135301047837
They entered the common hall, and placed themselves at table. A	268.1019190009697
gentleman, who had just arrived by the route of Dammartin, was seated	245.00157257324048
at the same table, and was breakfasting. He opened the conversation	334.7834886455123
about rain and fine weather; the travelers replied. He drank to their	278.89603302724595
good health, and the travelers returned his politeness.	329.0030678458231
But at the moment Mousqueton came to announce that the horses were	200.3811433477796
ready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to	231.34163410104443
Porthos to drink the health of the cardinal. Porthos replied that he	284.69127049237585
asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of	347.80370490602303
the king. The stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his	323.12155196252183
Eminence. Porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.	341.99158936165946
“You have committed a piece of folly,” said Athos, “but it can’t be	348.42660498435885
helped; there is no drawing back. Kill the fellow, and rejoin us as	185.11320164573644
soon as you can.”	224.62269978857833
All three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while	216.7668475767548
Porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the	357.85902795823375
thrusts known in the fencing schools.	190.11264816882618
“There goes one!” cried Athos, at the end of five hundred paces.	220.6126281010377
“But why did that man attack Porthos rather than any other one of us?”	247.3509424536412
asked Aramis.	193.2738873595709
“Because, as Porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took	294.50342841953136
him for the chief,” said D’Artagnan.	310.85304938114587
“I always said that this cadet from Gascony was a well of wisdom,”	227.43020781883175
murmured Athos; and the travelers continued their route.	319.4287485751771
At Beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a	204.22279327329824
little as to wait for Porthos. At the end of two hours, as Porthos did	221.48668740105836
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.	281.90970138162925
At a league from Beauvais, where the road was confined between two high	170.88535505164737
banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the	324.0062144073953
road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging	268.92389043332923
holes and filling up the ruts with mud.	362.5628586290263
Aramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,	307.50147654236434
apostrophized them rather sharply. Athos wished to restrain him, but it	166.78838494111653
was too late. The laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their	243.39447329523404
insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool Athos, who urged on	354.54450670574954
his horse against one of them.	353.30482113663504
Then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each	297.68524915385785
took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were	302.57863822931745
outnumbered in weapons. Aramis received a ball which passed through his	357.3090229193807
shoulder, and Mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part	229.8498609321097
which prolongs the lower portion of the loins. Therefore Mousqueton	333.1999951749755
alone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not	276.05851061509685
being able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it	176.9750026271043
really was.	307.7934101282416
“It was an ambuscade!” shouted D’Artagnan. “Don’t waste a charge!	182.64486084760662
Forward!”	251.77938028320494
Aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried	176.9566577630643
him on with the others. Mousqueton’s horse rejoined them, and galloped	335.5759347344454
by the side of his companions.	331.96281184878865
“That will serve us for a relay,” said Athos.	342.7480935683317
“I would rather have had a hat,” said D’Artagnan. “Mine was carried	314.9528315730479
away by a ball. By my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was	219.867062389372
not in it.”	339.85103732877513
“They’ll kill poor Porthos when he comes up,” said Aramis.	218.8091146464277
“If Porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,”	336.0756501691693
said Athos. “My opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not	364.3886230444527
intoxicated.”	203.76801606838146
They continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses	325.7845156905969
were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse	219.05095397145797
service.	219.9548209033058
The travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet	281.9987792474718
with less interruption; but at Crèvecœur, Aramis declared he could	365.1184981265011
proceed no farther. In fact, it required all the courage which he	246.46920842357162
concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so	242.29482455056336
far. He grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support	342.83096285182717
him on his horse. They lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left	355.6288749070105
Bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than	231.49453923347284
useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at Amiens.	221.2997568736788
“_Morbleu_,” said Athos, as soon as they were again in motion, “reduced	321.4155337829893
to two masters and Grimaud and Planchet! _Morbleu!_ I won’t be their	336.0332609949376
dupe, I will answer for it. I will neither open my mouth nor draw my	233.93016837408578
sword between this and Calais. I swear by—”	338.9929307738904
“Don’t waste time in swearing,” said D’Artagnan; “let us gallop, if our	276.95882707953314
horses will consent.”	328.84755644663744
And the travelers buried their rowels in their horses’ flanks, who thus	168.80716111334948
vigorously stimulated recovered their energies. They arrived at Amiens	219.3250473305912
at midnight, and alighted at the _auberge_ of the Golden Lily.	247.6848666594684
The host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. He	260.31391286058334
received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton	352.66120784181845
nightcap in the other. He wished to lodge the two travelers each in a	277.11882476952906
charming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the	233.40899637379192
opposite extremities of the hôtel. D’Artagnan and Athos refused them.	168.70618504153975
The host replied that he had no other worthy of their Excellencies; but	214.28502814625335
the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on	318.9960365159192
a mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. The host insisted;	188.80288471504497
but the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.	289.2001621825428
They had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within,	303.3846700060117
when someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there,	268.78331924874414
and recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter. It was	218.17714209370163
indeed Planchet and Grimaud.	290.7823824296013
“Grimaud can take care of the horses,” said Planchet. “If you are	318.3662450615924
willing, gentlemen, I will sleep across your doorway, and you will then	339.8646874303879
be certain that nobody can reach you.”	356.2709776390428
“And on what will you sleep?” said D’Artagnan.	178.0369316551984
“Here is my bed,” replied Planchet, producing a bundle of straw.	209.3309159089847
“Come, then,” said D’Artagnan, “you are right. Mine host’s face does	167.31381549552617
not please me at all; it is too gracious.”	305.3566110736743
“Nor me either,” said Athos.	219.628205921227
Planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the	320.4253546834043
doorway, while Grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable,	172.81394614964245
undertaking that by five o’clock in the morning he and the four horses	290.8981656658998
should be ready.	166.1741526709587
The night was quiet enough. Toward two o’clock in the morning somebody	238.61351511862188
endeavored to open the door; but as Planchet awoke in an instant and	221.68268788523756
cried, “Who goes there?” somebody replied that he was mistaken, and	297.1723987645141
went away.	353.88664878262784
At four o’clock in the morning they heard a terrible riot in the	340.62067694155616
stables. Grimaud had tried to waken the stable boys, and the stable	210.2482715826032
boys had beaten him. When they opened the window, they saw the poor lad	294.5184829898865
lying senseless, with his head split by a blow with a pitchfork.	251.99357127308292
Planchet went down into the yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but	336.4626046581659
the horses were all used up. Mousqueton’s horse which had traveled for	187.9712356381815
five or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able	208.69297098732966
to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary	329.97352464808137
surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the	192.68990734351573
host’s horses, had bled Mousqueton’s.	195.07173420370387
This began to be annoying. All these successive accidents were perhaps	300.6720013335425
the result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. Athos and	241.90213444754224
D’Artagnan went out, while Planchet was sent to inquire if there were	311.669905831327
not three horses for sale in the neighborhood. At the door stood two	304.207305061335
horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. These would just have suited	297.8938011936025
them. He asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had	262.9023252456225
passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the	314.2203548747178
host.	295.95393528415525
Athos went down to pay the reckoning, while D’Artagnan and Planchet	198.82126292093025
stood at the street door. The host was in a lower and back room, to	347.76079863190904
which Athos was requested to go.	217.2121115850146
Athos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to	209.4476003353734
pay the bill. The host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the	305.43021781745813
drawers of which was partly open. He took the money which Athos offered	365.51432032292735
to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,	284.2397073649445
suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his	303.2745011312245
companions arrested as forgers.	359.1026150781088
“You blackguard!” cried Athos, going toward him, “I’ll cut your ears	222.86479770243344
off!”	354.90846597744434
At the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side	221.75515008488213
doors, and rushed upon Athos.	295.5818830688487
“I am taken!” shouted Athos, with all the power of his lungs. “Go on,	343.50460330153965
D’Artagnan! Spur, spur!” and he fired two pistols.	199.04371906786997
D’Artagnan and Planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened	344.85525547045813
the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried	314.3693874800953
their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.	346.9414219545997
“Do you know what has become of Athos?” asked D’Artagnan of Planchet,	189.61896897530352
as they galloped on.	342.69098232932436
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, “I saw one fall at each of his two	253.1457082898275
shots, and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting	296.7692628660715
with his sword with the others.”	217.33040958783812
“Brave Athos!” murmured D’Artagnan, “and to think that we are compelled	203.33504106127975
to leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence. Forward,	316.2686970451566
Planchet, forward! You are a brave fellow.”	271.334248439451
“As I told you, monsieur,” replied Planchet, “Picards are found out by	304.6177441842487
being used. Besides, I am here in my own country, and that excites me.”	192.15410782768922
And both, with free use of the spur, arrived at St. Omer without	341.36772516003157
drawing bit. At St. Omer they breathed their horses with the bridles	330.77897232193175
passed under their arms for fear of accident, and ate a morsel from	287.0787941046201
their hands on the stones of the street, after they departed again.	365.7056934967827
At a hundred paces from the gates of Calais, D’Artagnan’s horse gave	176.79140529980126
out, and could not by any means be made to get up again, the blood	295.27772946662094
flowing from his eyes and his nose. There still remained Planchet’s	221.38486573196315
horse; but he stopped short, and could not be made to move a step.	251.26172725300478
Fortunately, as we have said, they were within a hundred paces of the	363.36710258620366
city; they left their two nags upon the high road, and ran toward the	185.23151548717152
quay. Planchet called his master’s attention to a gentleman who had	328.7355571119395
just arrived with his lackey, and only preceded them by about fifty	324.94625619314047
paces. They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared	204.4164462433592
to be in great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired	204.7985573501341
if he could not instantly cross over to England.	225.42161506183953
“Nothing would be more easy,” said the captain of a vessel ready to set	297.44962282245945
sail, “but this morning came an order to let no one leave without	342.0880656434032
express permission from the cardinal.”	181.06590559755722
“I have that permission,” said the gentleman, drawing the paper from	363.529739138453
his pocket; “here it is.”	282.14109084102097
“Have it examined by the governor of the port,” said the shipmaster,	180.89590126200542
“and give me the preference.”	169.56988342202612
“Where shall I find the governor?”	259.2673959643241
“At his country house.”	204.77594138934055
“And that is situated?”	178.54481126612657
“At a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from	188.29662892348543
here—at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof.”	330.9323456753784
“Very well,” said the gentleman. And, with his lackey, he took the road	178.97161663155288
to the governor’s country house.	219.68593085370378
D’Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five	176.91874613678806
hundred paces. Once outside the city, D’Artagnan overtook the gentleman	230.6519197570091
as he was entering a little wood.	290.3109009205092
“Monsieur, you appear to be in great haste?”	247.46780917112784
“No one can be more so, monsieur.”	355.2139008301051
“I am sorry for that,” said D’Artagnan; “for as I am in great haste	208.15740750897456
likewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service.”	214.03314836966615
“What?”	193.8441112397497
“To let me sail first.”	277.0539411699582
“That’s impossible,” said the gentleman; “I have traveled sixty leagues	248.14914664194532
in forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London.”	224.34900529940018
“I have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten o’clock	267.8392326744671
in the morning I must be in London.”	265.19622873796504
“Very sorry, monsieur; but I was here first, and will not sail second.”	202.64098375809942
“I am sorry, too, monsieur; but I arrived second, and must sail first.”	274.98431074199584
“The king’s service!” said the gentleman.	231.1625943490914
“My own service!” said D’Artagnan.	356.31590559700277
“But this is a needless quarrel you seek with me, as it seems to me.”	265.6845721662562
“_Parbleu!_ What do you desire it to be?”	304.94749961166985
“What do you want?”	287.997558788765
“Would you like to know?”	362.6631273152623
“Certainly.”	170.70468053686042
“Well, then, I wish that order of which you are bearer, seeing that I	346.3006902708862
have not one of my own and must have one.”	181.0191267342831
“You jest, I presume.”	232.28634193261243
“I never jest.”	278.06223067546625
“Let me pass!”	288.13012450184937
“You shall not pass.”	230.84327053901018
“My brave young man, I will blow out your brains. _Hola_, Lubin, my	253.13079263670656
pistols!”	207.2014879139005
“Planchet,” called out D’Artagnan, “take care of the lackey; I will	360.2802634233135
manage the master.”	249.90517439884468
Planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon Lubin; and being	267.7133178786698
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and	229.26566745401084
placed his knee upon his breast.	169.90520383273227
“Go on with your affair, monsieur,” cried Planchet; “I have finished	258.3604942606065
mine.”	354.54045515769644
Seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon D’Artagnan;	264.2719876885305
but he had too strong an adversary. In three seconds D’Artagnan had	263.57248443716674
wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, “One for Athos, one	336.6245662974443
for Porthos; and one for Aramis!”	214.16570440275007
At the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. D’Artagnan believed him	276.76489478418466
to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose	277.32640821595623
of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for	323.2694427539152
it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point	219.6039415279727
into D’Artagnan’s breast, crying, “One for you!”	174.25748001848282
“And one for me—the best for last!” cried D’Artagnan, furious, nailing	344.752629999647
him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.	316.783235749814
This time the gentleman closed his eyes and fainted. D’Artagnan	183.26737889839544
searched his pockets, and took from one of them the order for the	249.7184051160578
passage. It was in the name of Comte de Wardes.	329.16407432299377
Then, casting a glance on the handsome young man, who was scarcely	214.27618228874303
twenty-five years of age, and whom he was leaving in his gore, deprived	359.4365919147881
of sense and perhaps dead, he gave a sigh for that unaccountable	208.41225693417013
destiny which leads men to destroy each other for the interests of	179.92799769535682
people who are strangers to them and who often do not even know that	301.50377158289996
they exist. But he was soon aroused from these reflections by Lubin,	338.4359692280408
who uttered loud cries and screamed for help with all his might.	335.53228956336903
Planchet grasped him by the throat, and pressed as hard as he could.	268.04205371415793
“Monsieur,” said he, “as long as I hold him in this manner, he can’t	323.2197932008367
cry, I’ll be bound; but as soon as I let go he will howl again. I know	177.68801428360436
him for a Norman, and Normans are obstinate.”	321.7700915635495
In fact, tightly held as he was, Lubin endeavored still to cry out.	191.88261321598773
“Stay!” said D’Artagnan; and taking out his handkerchief, he gagged	281.12349870378233
him.	188.05819434910347
“Now,” said Planchet, “let us bind him to a tree.”	291.7949695953936
This being properly done, they drew the Comte de Wardes close to his	252.22489215938646
servant; and as night was approaching, and as the wounded man and the	186.91151640135791
bound man were at some little distance within the wood, it was evident	335.2902410728184
they were likely to remain there till the next day.	300.2412261690379
“And now,” said D’Artagnan, “to the Governor’s.”	205.4207949122145
“But you are wounded, it seems,” said Planchet.	273.13877232140965
“Oh, that’s nothing! Let us attend to what is more pressing first, and	353.78367532451796
then we will attend to my wound; besides, it does not seem very	357.2366264678949
dangerous.”	278.7638961470544
And they both set forward as fast as they could toward the country	245.35817988508896
house of the worthy functionary.	281.0927387521426
The Comte de Wardes was announced, and D’Artagnan was introduced.	204.66275948364927
“You have an order signed by the cardinal?” said the governor.	215.652940837489
“Yes, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan; “here it is.”	313.8745159565153
“Ah, ah! It is quite regular and explicit,” said the governor.	244.67141136627276
“Most likely,” said D’Artagnan; “I am one of his most faithful	316.5830115481417
servants.”	267.11988538376767
“It appears that his Eminence is anxious to prevent someone from	311.4652521601047
crossing to England?”	217.16952766389159
“Yes; a certain D’Artagnan, a Béarnese gentleman who left Paris in	359.555776233683
company with three of his friends, with the intention of going to	312.9968807515314
London.”	268.7547814019372
“Do you know him personally?” asked the governor.	238.66263204757593
“Whom?”	295.27956842022303
“This D’Artagnan.”	347.2401613757027
“Perfectly well.”	210.03398358735524
“Describe him to me, then.”	207.52388458490958
“Nothing more easy.”	321.1529256561156
And D’Artagnan gave, feature for feature, a description of the Comte de	356.6923006911834
Wardes.	227.09861653029913
“Is he accompanied?”	170.18618862453613
“Yes; by a lackey named Lubin.”	259.06029313217806
“We will keep a sharp lookout for them; and if we lay hands on them his	259.3322378057994
Eminence may be assured they will be reconducted to Paris under a good	197.5017072311723
escort.”	246.717086361614
“And by doing so, Monsieur the Governor,” said D’Artagnan, “you will	228.19510264514935
deserve well of the cardinal.”	346.3579585661214
“Shall you see him on your return, Monsieur Count?”	306.1525503702569
“Without a doubt.”	282.6090800302615
“Tell him, I beg you, that I am his humble servant.”	216.18822639914055
“I will not fail.”	349.0492288261139
Delighted with this assurance the governor countersigned the passport	235.66769495390315
and delivered it to D’Artagnan. D’Artagnan lost no time in useless	186.76054981251423
compliments. He thanked the governor, bowed, and departed. Once	223.93018556769388
outside, he and Planchet set off as fast as they could; and by making a	358.19473391025565
long detour avoided the wood and reentered the city by another gate.	331.03077915282245
The vessel was quite ready to sail, and the captain was waiting on the	356.1044492359475
wharf. “Well?” said he, on perceiving D’Artagnan.	345.5494858670531
“Here is my pass countersigned,” said the latter.	195.16816308208803
“And that other gentleman?	279.2626708529973
“He will not go today,” said D’Artagnan; “but here, I’ll pay you for us	245.80676738791874
two.”	307.71669196297717
“In that case let us go,” said the shipmaster.	268.13526706092097
“Let us go,” repeated D’Artagnan.	341.0633219064107
He leaped with Planchet into the boat, and five minutes after they were	177.55791978165382
on board. It was time; for they had scarcely sailed half a league, when	242.2342356348966
D’Artagnan saw a flash and heard a detonation. It was the cannon which	268.9378399267664
announced the closing of the port.	360.77557584815935
He had now leisure to look to his wound. Fortunately, as D’Artagnan had	208.56038084315122
thought, it was not dangerous. The point of the sword had touched a	188.95455737163954
rib, and glanced along the bone. Still further, his shirt had stuck to	277.02659128674287
the wound, and he had lost only a few drops of blood.	352.0269839300054
D’Artagnan was worn out with fatigue. A mattress was laid upon the deck	256.35472710211957
for him. He threw himself upon it, and fell asleep.	169.99232185236687
On the morrow, at break of day, they were still three or four leagues	321.2847597542373
from the coast of England. The breeze had been so light all night, they	260.89505907887957
had made but little progress. At ten o’clock the vessel cast anchor in	351.38121138576605
the harbor of Dover, and at half past ten D’Artagnan placed his foot on	170.07649934863807
English land, crying, “Here I am at last!”	188.15759414361395
But that was not all; they must get to London. In England the post was	352.5836519795497
well served. D’Artagnan and Planchet took each a post horse, and a	221.50156851473525
postillion rode before them. In a few hours they were in the capital.	204.97946924659996
D’Artagnan did not know London; he did not know a word of English; but	201.91611396777506
he wrote the name of Buckingham on a piece of paper, and everyone	243.74091716121734
pointed out to him the way to the duke’s hôtel.	212.5916648790519
The duke was at Windsor hunting with the king. D’Artagnan inquired for	319.47693044641187
the confidential valet of the duke, who, having accompanied him in all	347.22339791709265
his voyages, spoke French perfectly well; he told him that he came from	306.85244413292014
Paris on an affair of life and death, and that he must speak with his	347.2326014766134
master instantly.	202.99622443853733
The confidence with which D’Artagnan spoke convinced Patrick, which was	362.53408791399073
the name of this minister of the minister. He ordered two horses to be	331.02124396375257
saddled, and himself went as guide to the young Guardsman. As for	287.63109524173564
Planchet, he had been lifted from his horse as stiff as a rush; the	207.1608870191223
poor lad’s strength was almost exhausted. D’Artagnan seemed iron.	281.4955960015169
On their arrival at the castle they learned that Buckingham and the	214.60693498208173
king were hawking in the marshes two or three leagues away. In twenty	188.51663840158525
minutes they were on the spot named. Patrick soon caught the sound of	256.48183397656624
his master’s voice calling his falcon.	352.65993637742304
“Whom must I announce to my Lord Duke?” asked Patrick.	296.9786887958368
“The young man who one evening sought a quarrel with him on the Pont	304.55718136462167
Neuf, opposite the Samaritaine.”	325.30955573541587
“A singular introduction!”	170.95363708644638
“You will find that it is as good as another.”	243.33406089539127
Patrick galloped off, reached the duke, and announced to him in the	278.0430799925285
terms directed that a messenger awaited him.	224.22007745612288
Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that	180.5102353627193
something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be	169.22790570769837
informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and	360.54941296061133
recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into	194.8932331037466
a gallop, and rode straight up to D’Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept	341.73034539473736
in the background.	304.43044376403003
“No misfortune has happened to the queen?” cried Buckingham, the	186.25946326929554
instant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question.	362.49572707475824
“I believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from	216.6677634315557
which your Grace alone can extricate her.”	347.90931524621135
“I!” cried Buckingham. “What is it? I should be too happy to be of any	204.66894158243332
service to her. Speak, speak!”	179.76765987018405
“Take this letter,” said D’Artagnan.	301.16400417033253
“This letter! From whom comes this letter?”	276.72041445127246
“From her Majesty, as I think.”	174.0019502807633
“From her Majesty!” said Buckingham, becoming so pale that D’Artagnan	202.3220843679823
feared he would faint as he broke the seal.	264.3703815197965
“What is this rent?” said he, showing D’Artagnan a place where it had	297.11456074510653
been pierced through.	312.2098886247333
“Ah,” said D’Artagnan, “I did not see that; it was the sword of the	311.3468138914381
Comte de Wardes which made that hole, when he gave me a good thrust in	221.0508566349954
the breast.”	283.7031135519251
“You are wounded?” asked Buckingham, as he opened the letter.	280.06475895075005
“Oh, nothing but a scratch,” said D’Artagnan.	176.62465216050654
“Just heaven, what have I read?” cried the duke. “Patrick, remain here,	181.8219113259649
or rather join the king, wherever he may be, and tell his Majesty that	227.5736551319048
I humbly beg him to excuse me, but an affair of the greatest importance	365.2273157943187
recalls me to London. Come, monsieur, come!” and both set off towards	317.6937029166244
the capital at full gallop.	173.27993358281398
Chapter XXI.	279.5607252439217
THE COUNTESS DE WINTER	300.5054715389296
As they rode along, the duke endeavored to draw from D’Artagnan, not	278.9233260222822
all that had happened, but what D’Artagnan himself knew. By adding all	283.97516482367496
that he heard from the mouth of the young man to his own remembrances,	292.0867569741737
he was enabled to form a pretty exact idea of a position of the	333.328261663729
seriousness of which, for the rest, the queen’s letter, short but	297.7973722162511
explicit, gave him the clue. But that which astonished him most was	326.7378456385013
that the cardinal, so deeply interested in preventing this young man	249.77221483150709
from setting his foot in England, had not succeeded in arresting him on	247.8554499514662
the road. It was then, upon the manifestation of this astonishment,	328.41600184785955
that D’Artagnan related to him the precaution taken, and how, thanks to	332.4057737011224
the devotion of his three friends, whom he had left scattered and	204.46821347493798
bleeding on the road, he had succeeded in coming off with a single	176.6679130723149
sword thrust, which had pierced the queen’s letter and for which he had	183.2094423331449
repaid M. de Wardes with such terrible coin. While he was listening to	192.65816168737814
this recital, delivered with the greatest simplicity, the duke looked	254.67216136842873
from time to time at the young man with astonishment, as if he could	183.65050139750602
not comprehend how so much prudence, courage, and devotedness could be	249.64816747346768
allied with a countenance which indicated not more than twenty years.	225.29028943869451
The horses went like the wind, and in a few minutes they were at the	279.9883037949676
gates of London. D’Artagnan imagined that on arriving in town the duke	179.2521774899604
would slacken his pace, but it was not so. He kept on his way at the	250.1651837508125
same rate, heedless about upsetting those whom he met on the road. In	302.02191655225647
fact, in crossing the city two or three accidents of this kind	206.32451646913267
happened; but Buckingham did not even turn his head to see what became	298.37473124684027
of those he had knocked down. D’Artagnan followed him amid cries which	335.1582885285229
strongly resembled curses.	234.33342831004296
On entering the court of his hôtel, Buckingham sprang from his horse,	306.53512812226097
and without thinking what became of the animal, threw the bridle on his	267.9244296141855
neck, and sprang toward the vestibule. D’Artagnan did the same, with a	202.93955175458063
little more concern, however, for the noble creatures, whose merits he	181.3931655903923
fully appreciated; but he had the satisfaction of seeing three or four	237.21858235399603
grooms run from the kitchens and the stables, and busy themselves with	336.7450393992464
the steeds.	216.7706178601243
The duke walked so fast that D’Artagnan had some trouble in keeping up	263.2391923754605
with him. He passed through several apartments, of an elegance of which	233.64632542241517
even the greatest nobles of France had not even an idea, and arrived at	222.36901317382035
length in a bedchamber which was at once a miracle of taste and of	345.59974492751314
richness. In the alcove of this chamber was a door concealed in the	200.98607107306177
tapestry which the duke opened with a little gold key which he wore	281.3128778489657
suspended from his neck by a chain of the same metal. With discretion	365.6421959502703
D’Artagnan remained behind; but at the moment when Buckingham crossed	300.85164912279265
the threshold, he turned round, and seeing the hesitation of the young	315.41438749595767
man, “Come in!” cried he, “and if you have the good fortune to be	215.57645966996805
admitted to her Majesty’s presence, tell her what you have seen.”	183.8741594055802
Encouraged by this invitation, D’Artagnan followed the duke, who closed	282.2372693415269
the door after them. The two found themselves in a small chapel covered	263.97702436619284
with a tapestry of Persian silk worked with gold, and brilliantly	334.30385652593225
lighted with a vast number of candles. Over a species of altar, and	254.03239668398948
beneath a canopy of blue velvet, surmounted by white and red plumes,	274.36920517176344
was a full-length portrait of Anne of Austria, so perfect in its	252.38122808740985
resemblance that D’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise on beholding it.	191.06252252946817
One might believe the queen was about to speak. On the altar, and	344.0635569376425
beneath the portrait, was the casket containing the diamond studs.	350.2015067376391
The duke approached the altar, knelt as a priest might have done before	224.67994570480948
a crucifix, and opened the casket. “There,” said he, drawing from the	249.4628522952185
casket a large bow of blue ribbon all sparkling with diamonds, “there	169.08518385191664
are the precious studs which I have taken an oath should be buried with	255.76156143913568
me. The queen gave them to me, the queen requires them again. Her will	176.82523671568808
be done, like that of God, in all things.”	179.83878094838477
Then, he began to kiss, one after the other, those dear studs with	309.86870361487945
which he was about to part. All at once he uttered a terrible cry.	171.06277317283238
“What is the matter?” exclaimed D’Artagnan, anxiously; “what has	213.24137939712688
happened to you, my Lord?”	257.78787894215606
“All is lost!” cried Buckingham, becoming as pale as a corpse; “two of	349.81598927718926
the studs are wanting, there are only ten.”	301.0273907243095
“Can you have lost them, my Lord, or do you think they have been	200.80374786041003
stolen?”	281.04650220823214
“They have been stolen,” replied the duke, “and it is the cardinal who	247.21438941551628
has dealt this blow. Hold; see! The ribbons which held them have been	346.47058136958475
cut with scissors.”	330.70618847339233
“If my Lord suspects they have been stolen, perhaps the person who	213.2705612358385
stole them still has them in his hands.”	263.56372499319673
“Wait, wait!” said the duke. “The only time I have worn these studs was	294.830228958602
at a ball given by the king eight days ago at Windsor. The Comtesse de	363.26056949232157
Winter, with whom I had quarreled, became reconciled to me at that	361.94211141018917
ball. That reconciliation was nothing but the vengeance of a jealous	248.62370429497855
woman. I have never seen her from that day. The woman is an agent of	282.0343861607908
the cardinal.”	243.67846417942013
“He has agents, then, throughout the world?” cried D’Artagnan.	359.3255194962819
“Oh, yes,” said Buckingham, grating his teeth with rage. “Yes, he is a	193.14255275923375
terrible antagonist. But when is this ball to take place?”	194.4418245352354
“Monday next.”	279.4160583381722
“Monday next! Still five days before us. That’s more time than we want.	312.4411763091499
Patrick!” cried the duke, opening the door of the chapel, “Patrick!”	344.86140432625734
His confidential valet appeared.	364.86332918098594
“My jeweler and my secretary.”	230.4732209082115
The valet went out with a mute promptitude which showed him accustomed	294.42518235042235
to obey blindly and without reply.	179.52196678264352
But although the jeweler had been mentioned first, it was the secretary	198.18823684239987
who first made his appearance. This was simply because he lived in the	308.7556349892934
hôtel. He found Buckingham seated at a table in his bedchamber, writing	175.0551626556663
orders with his own hand.	328.79317770270154
“Mr. Jackson,” said he, “go instantly to the Lord Chancellor, and tell	272.2536798438021
him that I charge him with the execution of these orders. I wish them	328.49337561328286
to be promulgated immediately.”	248.177020213076
“But, my Lord, if the Lord Chancellor interrogates me upon the motives	242.27497968848257
which may have led your Grace to adopt such an extraordinary measure,	203.45260041232476
what shall I reply?”	201.28604920607214
“That such is my pleasure, and that I answer for my will to no man.”	222.7832888106118
“Will that be the answer,” replied the secretary, smiling, “which he	173.47800562134424
must transmit to his Majesty if, by chance, his Majesty should have the	288.1398713751149
curiosity to know why no vessel is to leave any of the ports of Great	176.4177924109216
Britain?”	287.5113374533331
“You are right, Mr. Jackson,” replied Buckingham. “He will say, in that	199.05566876358887
case, to the king that I am determined on war, and that this measure is	251.7088319318166
my first act of hostility against France.”	200.67243105684338
The secretary bowed and retired.	306.86307097821975
“We are safe on that side,” said Buckingham, turning toward D’Artagnan.	268.9899248970229
“If the studs are not yet gone to Paris, they will not arrive till	279.7043870806337
after you.”	209.08467777262746
“How so?”	227.7799612783167
“I have just placed an embargo on all vessels at present in his	178.9414229501182
Majesty’s ports, and without particular permission, not one dare lift	269.207072680077
an anchor.”	323.15353419492305
D’Artagnan looked with stupefaction at a man who thus employed the	309.49367456719426
unlimited power with which he was clothed by the confidence of a king	174.96998591433214
in the prosecution of his intrigues. Buckingham saw by the expression	220.13571767464282
of the young man’s face what was passing in his mind, and he smiled.	209.8526935354273
“Yes,” said he, “yes, Anne of Austria is my true queen. Upon a word	335.72036139829504
from her, I would betray my country, I would betray my king, I would	244.96315113712342
betray my God. She asked me not to send the Protestants of La Rochelle	352.83805227735206
the assistance I promised them; I have not done so. I broke my word, it	212.7294568226258
is true; but what signifies that? I obeyed my love; and have I not been	302.15139429125134
richly paid for that obedience? It was to that obedience I owe her	294.67125410924615
portrait.”	342.608994594904
D’Artagnan was amazed to note by what fragile and unknown threads the	345.26396456363506
destinies of nations and the lives of men are suspended. He was lost in	329.57478696326405
these reflections when the goldsmith entered. He was an Irishman—one of	214.76923149859633
the most skillful of his craft, and who himself confessed that he	221.8076551345444
gained a hundred thousand livres a year by the Duke of Buckingham.	286.8557566016095
“Mr. O’Reilly,” said the duke, leading him into the chapel, “look at	290.6796936315395
these diamond studs, and tell me what they are worth apiece.”	220.8396697915115
The goldsmith cast a glance at the elegant manner in which they were	357.07407941891165
set, calculated, one with another, what the diamonds were worth, and	289.4966519863516
without hesitation said, “Fifteen hundred pistoles each, my Lord.”	192.15075096283786
“How many days would it require to make two studs exactly like them?	225.20159519973814
You see there are two wanting.”	306.5827446521708
“Eight days, my Lord.”	254.06626896772894
“I will give you three thousand pistoles apiece if I can have them by	229.08642082058134
the day after tomorrow.”	340.82329000443497
“My Lord, they shall be yours.”	209.64790691655264
“You are a jewel of a man, Mr. O’Reilly; but that is not all. These	210.1667156949577
studs cannot be trusted to anybody; it must be done in the palace.”	313.3246534423776
“Impossible, my Lord! There is no one but myself can so execute them	309.67416329258856
that one cannot tell the new from the old.”	331.2684327144149
“Therefore, my dear Mr. O’Reilly, you are my prisoner. And if you wish	309.7578220161211
ever to leave my palace, you cannot; so make the best of it. Name to me	284.1585142585982
such of your workmen as you need, and point out the tools they must	297.9949427425662
bring.”	281.32862842845174
The goldsmith knew the duke. He knew all objection would be useless,	289.87919406548974
and instantly determined how to act.	270.7342093231227
“May I be permitted to inform my wife?” said he.	166.4296957173639
“Oh, you may even see her if you like, my dear Mr. O’Reilly. Your	174.10168351368628
captivity shall be mild, be assured; and as every inconvenience	207.2878413971217
deserves its indemnification, here is, in addition to the price of the	298.05335435727886
studs, an order for a thousand pistoles, to make you forget the	290.4496551664254
annoyance I cause you.”	187.9736859401022
D’Artagnan could not get over the surprise created in him by this	237.7257654649876
minister, who thus open-handed, sported with men and millions.	288.480579589891
As to the goldsmith, he wrote to his wife, sending her the order for	248.52335470101502
the thousand pistoles, and charging her to send him, in exchange, his	185.51196189056472
most skillful apprentice, an assortment of diamonds, of which he gave	180.00757112322003
the names and the weight, and the necessary tools.	303.38034680886165
Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to the chamber destined for him, and	256.21773440002045
which, at the end of half an hour, was transformed into a workshop.	200.57688867608547
Then he placed a sentinel at each door, with an order to admit nobody	238.424053868018
upon any pretense but his _valet de chambre_, Patrick. We need not add	352.82267506843414
that the goldsmith, O’Reilly, and his assistant, were prohibited from	316.2422946560413
going out under any pretext. This point, settled, the duke turned to	325.6752604750052
D’Artagnan. “Now, my young friend,” said he, “England is all our own.	287.125860027306
What do you wish for? What do you desire?”	298.44774009729736
“A bed, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan. “At present, I confess, that is	360.0124815270209
the thing I stand most in need of.”	172.69128349676373
Buckingham gave D’Artagnan a chamber adjoining his own. He wished to	242.39720443682356
have the young man at hand—not that he at all mistrusted him, but for	257.17365203831076
the sake of having someone to whom he could constantly talk of the	308.1339569041887
queen.	354.680049037955
In one hour after, the ordinance was published in London that no vessel	365.69720900359675
bound for France should leave port, not even the packet boat with	248.80508689205246
letters. In the eyes of everybody this was a declaration of war between	328.71412493771095
the two kingdoms.	197.53240358724926
On the day after the morrow, by eleven o’clock, the two diamond studs	216.0531345803029
were finished, and they were so completely imitated, so perfectly	275.6338855920122
alike, that Buckingham could not tell the new ones from the old ones,	318.88682008664955
and experts in such matters would have been deceived as he was. He	361.0372619317932
immediately called D’Artagnan. “Here,” said he to him, “are the diamond	259.25921996911285
studs that you came to bring; and be my witness that I have done all	322.6270037656118
that human power could do.”	265.9584501918516
“Be satisfied, my Lord, I will tell all that I have seen. But does your	205.40503957640527
Grace mean to give me the studs without the casket?”	305.0837376188547
“The casket would encumber you. Besides, the casket is the more	171.0319929694035
precious from being all that is left to me. You will say that I keep	172.1751483952716
it.”	283.50045687673054
“I will perform your commission, word for word, my Lord.”	269.94943331087757
“And now,” resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, “how	310.8002648289246
shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you?”	311.3360044848539
D’Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes. He saw that the duke	235.12899759169926
was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea	175.35486559339108
that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with	209.24322125363446
English gold was strangely repugnant to him.	260.9245614932817
“Let us understand each other, my Lord,” replied D’Artagnan, “and let	332.0327307513229
us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake.	353.32610184328996
I am in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of	178.86495608953823
the company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law,	339.85563041227624
Monsieur de Tréville, is particularly attached to their Majesties. What	325.61188819404873
I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your	233.8548415597757
Grace. And still further, it is very probable I should not have done	210.11014482871184
anything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to	280.59736245625965
someone who is my lady, as the queen is yours.”	318.92676993792736
“Yes,” said the duke, smiling, “and I even believe that I know that	262.383050337562
other person; it is—”	187.92493733877689
“My Lord, I have not named her!” interrupted the young man, warmly.	354.4396589828014
“That is true,” said the duke; “and it is to this person I am bound to	221.6570830549493
discharge my debt of gratitude.”	197.8364054636797
“You have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is	299.2357587494507
question of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but	309.5134256263882
an Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much	204.20036506588315
greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at	199.92464013128986
Windsor or the corridors of the Louvre—all which, however, will not	208.18689109415882
prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from	321.5452339143769
laying down my life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I	186.37158224247716
repeat it to your Grace, without your having personally on that account	303.57452968318637
more to thank me for in this second interview than for what I did for	199.713296464105
you in the first.”	365.4746369662741
“We say, ‘Proud as a Scotsman,’” murmured the Duke of Buckingham.	356.162303102068
“And we say, ‘Proud as a Gascon,’” replied D’Artagnan. “The Gascons are	284.09172320240845
the Scots of France.”	272.5561464388585
D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and was retiring.	336.79397361368456
“Well, are you going away in that manner? Where, and how?”	340.2048405279787
“That’s true!”	328.15011881122894
“Fore Gad, these Frenchmen have no consideration!”	348.23177116411574
“I had forgotten that England was an island, and that you were the king	278.77862356537054
of it.”	171.09363750993546
“Go to the riverside, ask for the brig _Sund_, and give this letter to	236.9419752858198
the captain; he will convey you to a little port, where certainly you	351.01872213017555
are not expected, and which is ordinarily only frequented by	292.93329720875863
fishermen.”	175.7998243884892
“The name of that port?”	248.93394991924794
“St. Valery; but listen. When you have arrived there you will go to a	271.4263886285256
mean tavern, without a name and without a sign—a mere fisherman’s hut.	226.49907106185805
You cannot be mistaken; there is but one.”	333.8117483078598
“Afterward?”	204.94739468354484
“You will ask for the host, and will repeat to him the word ‘Forward!’”	305.2852442170371
“Which means?”	214.39626715067791
“In French, _En avant_. It is the password. He will give you a horse	221.54285456713885
all saddled, and will point out to you the road you ought to take. You	364.732074515829
will find, in the same way, four relays on your route. If you will give	305.94013385003433
at each of these relays your address in Paris, the four horses will	330.89859598194676
follow you thither. You already know two of them, and you appeared to	327.2921550293088
appreciate them like a judge. They were those we rode on; and you may	239.7728734133179
rely upon me for the others not being inferior to them. These horses	218.1263109243204
are equipped for the field. However proud you may be, you will not	257.59248449636533
refuse to accept one of them, and to request your three companions to	229.44388921066837
accept the others—that is, in order to make war against us. Besides,	246.27498085095255
the end justified the means, as you Frenchmen say, does it not?”	356.27264144594983
“Yes, my Lord, I accept them,” said D’Artagnan; “and if it please God,	319.4092205816981
we will make a good use of your presents.”	325.60029102120563
“Well, now, your hand, young man. Perhaps we shall soon meet on the	181.4342641142373
field of battle; but in the meantime we shall part good friends, I	252.16935490543239
hope.”	226.03165117738575
“Yes, my Lord; but with the hope of soon becoming enemies.”	228.67591101868288
“Be satisfied; I promise you that.”	234.86242981467137
“I depend upon your word, my Lord.”	355.252691046064
D’Artagnan bowed to the duke, and made his way as quickly as possible	256.34985583501486
to the riverside. Opposite the Tower of London he found the vessel that	206.74388932763273
had been named to him, delivered his letter to the captain, who after	282.2990906580844
having it examined by the governor of the port made immediate	251.5519565377924
preparations to sail.	229.05466594765744
Fifty vessels were waiting to set out. Passing alongside one of them,	351.6026481271674
D’Artagnan fancied he perceived on board it the woman of Meung—the same	340.15323840792666
whom the unknown gentleman had called Milady, and whom D’Artagnan had	179.37076185169192
thought so handsome; but thanks to the current of the stream and a fair	265.9016174683467
wind, his vessel passed so quickly that he had little more than a	364.9411280099508
glimpse of her.	197.68892094649266
The next day about nine o’clock in the morning, he landed at St.	239.70468212840922
Valery. D’Artagnan went instantly in search of the inn, and easily	357.9263817945315
discovered it by the riotous noise which resounded from it. War between	340.67802759277015
England and France was talked of as near and certain, and the jolly	239.47379836371763
sailors were having a carousal.	190.5902151336252
D’Artagnan made his way through the crowd, advanced toward the host,	363.34439232977115
and pronounced the word “Forward!” The host instantly made him a sign	203.22972044138194
to follow, went out with him by a door which opened into a yard, led	192.87536416647563
him to the stable, where a saddled horse awaited him, and asked him if	197.70092632369852
he stood in need of anything else.	335.5439305465201
“I want to know the route I am to follow,” said D’Artagnan.	171.04751764162796
“Go from hence to Blangy, and from Blangy to Neufchâtel. At Neufchâtel,	352.18919234819805
go to the tavern of the Golden Harrow, give the password to the	295.8171291707299
landlord, and you will find, as you have here, a horse ready saddled.”	181.53642879557998
“Have I anything to pay?” demanded D’Artagnan.	198.10693251823596
“Everything is paid,” replied the host, “and liberally. Begone, and may	289.1862048659161
God guide you!”	272.21916836864534
“Amen!” cried the young man, and set off at full gallop.	178.46609962507424
Four hours later he was in Neufchâtel. He strictly followed the	289.799033949806
instructions he had received. At Neufchâtel, as at St. Valery, he found	329.98995531665616
a horse quite ready and awaiting him. He was about to remove the	280.2896863423066
pistols from the saddle he had quit to the one he was about to fill,	180.9428748919661
but he found the holsters furnished with similar pistols.	251.98082592589066
“Your address at Paris?”	260.3791890456272
“Hôtel of the Guards, company of Dessessart.”	334.0892552317579
“Enough,” replied the questioner.	310.1848068751116
“Which route must I take?” demanded D’Artagnan, in his turn.	282.7230414945513
“That of Rouen; but you will leave the city on your right. You must	202.56875381195906
stop at the little village of Eccuis, in which there is but one	191.0610106105751
tavern—the Shield of France. Don’t condemn it from appearances; you	230.1633711404015
will find a horse in the stables quite as good as this.”	239.1615103851376
“The same password?”	325.4493476514516
“Exactly.”	360.771536363823
“Adieu, master!”	193.75102091847035
“A good journey, gentlemen! Do you want anything?”	290.9741384394914
D’Artagnan shook his head, and set off at full speed. At Eccuis, the	284.2809281665457
same scene was repeated. He found as provident a host and a fresh	288.5474036615058
horse. He left his address as he had done before, and set off again at	215.5817975896435
the same pace for Pontoise. At Pontoise he changed his horse for the	314.36489970329336
last time, and at nine o’clock galloped into the yard of Tréville’s	332.4868137568824
hôtel. He had made nearly sixty leagues in little more than twelve	275.28255435442577
hours.	183.13561188264123
M. de Tréville received him as if he had seen him that same morning;	307.9579183832511
only, when pressing his hand a little more warmly than usual, he	233.4181357989128
informed him that the company of Dessessart was on duty at the Louvre,	357.13730855914423
and that he might repair at once to his post.	170.8740201664735
Chapter XXII.	298.1093513448448
THE BALLET OF LA MERLAISON	258.4451430022833
On the morrow, nothing was talked of in Paris but the ball which the	264.9246480789448
aldermen of the city were to give to the king and queen, and in which	339.30241389619067
their Majesties were to dance the famous La Merlaison—the favorite	292.04081936968953
ballet of the king.	306.25120482825423
Eight days had been occupied in preparations at the Hôtel de Ville for	229.74014383945803
this important evening. The city carpenters had erected scaffolds upon	198.45532072272388
which the invited ladies were to be placed; the city grocer had	197.07449252434543
ornamented the chambers with two hundred _flambeaux_ of white wax, a	282.183890935324
piece of luxury unheard of at that period; and twenty violins were	351.6710131516313
ordered, and the price for them fixed at double the usual rate, upon	247.5845217861546
condition, said the report, that they should be played all night.	247.10892666631963
At ten o’clock in the morning the Sieur de la Coste, ensign in the	231.16549264456447
king’s Guards, followed by two officers and several archers of that	256.9898174611328
body, came to the city registrar, named Clement, and demanded of him	175.38451837536311
all the keys of the rooms and offices of the hôtel. These keys were	177.37913622295324
given up to him instantly. Each of them had a ticket attached to it, by	276.21632137013864
which it might be recognized; and from that moment the Sieur de la	245.3735102034624
Coste was charged with the care of all the doors and all the avenues.	201.56012227879438
At eleven o’clock came in his turn Duhallier, captain of the Guards,	283.47033299891086
bringing with him fifty archers, who were distributed immediately	263.1032641689257
through the Hôtel de Ville, at the doors assigned them.	208.78290427954377
At three o’clock came two companies of the Guards, one French, the	293.02705137501385
other Swiss. The company of French guards was composed of half of M.	175.1838563287944
Duhallier’s men and half of M. Dessessart’s men.	230.54886931124125
At six in the evening the guests began to come. As fast as they	321.8407722612297
entered, they were placed in the grand saloon, on the platforms	264.0878595865939
prepared for them.	303.1813956780411
At nine o’clock Madame la Première Présidente arrived. As next to the	268.8057797830264
queen, she was the most considerable personage of the fête, she was	279.56698507663
received by the city officials, and placed in a box opposite to that	216.03272290128783
which the queen was to occupy.	166.48538316265237
At ten o’clock, the king’s collation, consisting of preserves and other	223.3483037775173
delicacies, was prepared in the little room on the side of the church	171.96171692061944
of St. Jean, in front of the silver buffet of the city, which was	176.7151603965126
guarded by four archers.	287.41121280282454
At midnight great cries and loud acclamations were heard. It was the	287.4133437377824
king, who was passing through the streets which led from the Louvre to	341.70097566841935
the Hôtel de Ville, and which were all illuminated with colored	225.09348384021135
lanterns.	225.42958763664328
Immediately the aldermen, clothed in their cloth robes and preceded by	301.25010370378413
six sergeants, each holding a _flambeau_ in his hand, went to attend	330.2500367320364
upon the king, whom they met on the steps, where the provost of the	342.50083667822827
merchants made him the speech of welcome—a compliment to which his	226.53800757617316
Majesty replied with an apology for coming so late, laying the blame	214.06358615618194
upon the cardinal, who had detained him till eleven o’clock, talking of	290.50773162330677
affairs of state.	300.05877578458467
His Majesty, in full dress, was accompanied by his royal Highness, M.	180.58864421005907
le Comte de Soissons, by the Grand Prior, by the Duc de Longueville, by	344.48489976137876
the Duc d’Eubœuf, by the Comte d’Harcourt, by the Comte de la	233.65271101509657
Roche-Guyon, by M. de Liancourt, by M. de Baradas, by the Comte de	361.24479159961254
Cramail, and by the Chevalier de Souveray. Everybody noticed that the	320.8891706506407
king looked dull and preoccupied.	303.8167245557503
A private room had been prepared for the king and another for Monsieur.	352.6405175720788
In each of these closets were placed masquerade dresses. The same had	213.08643051135243
been done for the queen and Madame the President. The nobles and ladies	166.08972979039268
of their Majesties’ suites were to dress, two by two, in chambers	172.74248472441502
prepared for the purpose. Before entering his closet the king desired	264.757668194397
to be informed the moment the cardinal arrived.	349.1560129409611
Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were	258.2873709563721
heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as	330.9599068914282
they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to	288.28531699445443
receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and	266.9235108359852
it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary.	245.26635010153265
At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that	220.62072986850947
time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal	219.63814846964084
appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed	317.7530560999493
upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his	265.24412033944384
lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs.	222.00670517201243
The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the	196.89943314352897
city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at	188.50430389664214
once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the	350.0037728337377
hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was	350.25822688219836
very pale.	228.55588050472898
The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons	272.85814164382634
of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an	337.36961576991047
altered voice said, “Why, madame, have you not thought proper to wear	324.7102746838822
your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much	242.39698682608434
gratification?”	268.314622659158
The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a	170.18942929515384
diabolical smile on his countenance.	356.44030194198285
“Sire,” replied the queen, with a faltering voice, “because, in the	195.21205923580465
midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to	228.3916792222127
them.”	268.20635297893233
“And you were wrong, madame. If I made you that present it was that you	180.20308827661094
might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.”	207.19148608613935
The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and	364.02505178601564
listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed.	220.33051975914339
“Sire,” said the queen, “I can send for them to the Louvre, where they	290.8309045535773
are, and thus your Majesty’s wishes will be complied with.”	296.32614175897584
“Do so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet	184.77645413022105
will commence.”	200.37683612714014
The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were	353.8663873757379
to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his	340.035485488977
apartment.	349.33752718013733
There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody	309.22188441310254
had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but	316.6009420577553
both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew	324.84084761200694
several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to	319.01806865715366
sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.	334.19213657245496
The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting	266.3394494059896
costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This	324.9228146404974
was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really	362.29255166818416
appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom.	202.83522290556425
The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small	308.84858791304356
casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs.	272.87182782680503
“What does this mean?” demanded he of the cardinal.	248.4941426318447
“Nothing,” replied the latter; “only, if the queen has the studs, which	209.21781721316614
I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her	173.2302262851368
Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.”	332.3054467743242
The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had	198.3324230072874
not time to address any question to him—a cry of admiration burst from	228.95288778240263
every mouth. If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his	289.85448373936333
kingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in	357.1877964228538
France.	171.6851236599638
It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably. She wore	351.5724022020237
a beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet,	333.5614076172337
fastened with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin,	209.02294396670163
embroidered with silver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond	225.27217072191567
studs, on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat.	364.27856415543863
The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although,	310.27736248510996
distant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs.	255.388033323013
The queen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve?	350.10848378446167
At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king	209.25443622556875
advanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and	201.56453836810715
his Highness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the	267.2115080434734
ballet began.	363.56656856857063
The king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he	200.55002042009747
devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the	252.5399791660505
number. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal.	220.77837257258187
The ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen _entrées_. The ballet ended	282.42461966126274
amid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his	219.7789253171434
lady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had	237.71900869568765
of leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen.	289.9240925619186
“I thank you, madame,” said he, “for the deference you have shown to my	174.56910594371533
wishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to	184.63588759684896
you.”	360.67722559938875
With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal	224.58154247086281
had given him.	281.21720651945225
“How, sire?” cried the young queen, affecting surprise, “you are giving	246.47859962512553
me, then, two more: I shall have fourteen.”	173.0648885374934
In fact the king counted them, and the twelve studs were all on her	354.03795573017874
Majesty’s shoulder.	237.2230452146058
The king called the cardinal.	331.7220378890364
“What does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal?” asked the king in a severe	276.1362632766355
tone.	184.43326859897883
“This means, sire,” replied the cardinal, “that I was desirous of	330.52386262039784
presenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to	170.89647123725018
offer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept	316.40126668582457
them.”	271.25031221819165
“And I am the more grateful to your Eminence,” replied Anne of Austria,	220.184817613422
with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious	322.6789423726947
gallantry, “from being certain that these two studs alone have cost you	322.0076112908462
as much as all the others cost his Majesty.”	310.66097148514814
Then saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to	215.38625572962397
the chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her	277.41109347080993
costume.	357.20144425626484
The attention which we have been obliged to give, during the	364.06127998536465
commencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have	166.7824330448483
introduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom	302.7937068947772
Anne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over	284.650225056993
the cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered	246.2095086544295
at one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to	288.8315061164345
four persons—the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself.	201.15177221386432
The queen had just regained her chamber, and D’Artagnan was about to	357.92926659262605
retire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched. He turned and saw a	307.15895917960313
young woman, who made him a sign to follow her. The face of this young	358.35549559749074
woman was covered with a black velvet mask; but notwithstanding this	211.90777359593426
precaution, which was in fact taken rather against others than against	347.35423447825815
him, he at once recognized his usual guide, the light and intelligent	345.40710181886334
Mme. Bonacieux.	216.9972893188199
On the evening before, they had scarcely seen each other for a moment	274.286755895786
at the apartment of the Swiss guard, Germain, whither D’Artagnan had	351.96243188536687
sent for her. The haste which the young woman was in to convey to the	302.13798582318896
queen the excellent news of the happy return of her messenger prevented	230.51161561806282
the two lovers from exchanging more than a few words. D’Artagnan	258.3071437702089
therefore followed Mme. Bonacieux moved by a double sentiment—love and	181.1024653906083
curiosity. All the way, and in proportion as the corridors became more	305.7824229734074
deserted, D’Artagnan wished to stop the young woman, seize her and gaze	293.9634842659734
upon her, were it only for a minute; but quick as a bird she glided	261.65817104083783
between his hands, and when he wished to speak to her, her finger	342.46865283576653
placed upon her mouth, with a little imperative gesture full of grace,	322.3584079230011
reminded him that he was under the command of a power which he must	263.4734258900075
blindly obey, and which forbade him even to make the slightest	214.96391408553103
complaint. At length, after winding about for a minute or two, Mme.	276.57898251620577
Bonacieux opened the door of a closet, which was entirely dark, and led	218.83831443759985
D’Artagnan into it. There she made a fresh sign of silence, and opened	270.8105436514879
a second door concealed by tapestry. The opening of this door disclosed	334.25455757831674
a brilliant light, and she disappeared.	169.96403182487035
D’Artagnan remained for a moment motionless, asking himself where he	171.57278849155523
could be; but soon a ray of light which penetrated through the chamber,	298.65619243665526
together with the warm and perfumed air which reached him from the same	316.70814952913463
aperture, the conversation of two of three ladies in language at once	189.5565676483449
respectful and refined, and the word “Majesty” several times repeated,	260.30742345102544
indicated clearly that he was in a closet attached to the queen’s	337.1178663509392
apartment. The young man waited in comparative darkness and listened.	355.36170173465746
The queen appeared cheerful and happy, which seemed to astonish the	281.13474817996365
persons who surrounded her and who were accustomed to see her almost	218.58171053245044
always sad and full of care. The queen attributed this joyous feeling	347.4818310193082
to the beauty of the fête, to the pleasure she had experienced in the	350.4201044477511
ballet; and as it is not permissible to contradict a queen, whether she	301.4550415652457
smile or weep, everybody expatiated on the gallantry of the aldermen of	221.26903575752561
the city of Paris.	233.57543364604254
Although D’Artagnan did not at all know the queen, he soon	278.35768793946727
distinguished her voice from the others, at first by a slightly foreign	186.38003340995795
accent, and next by that tone of domination naturally impressed upon	316.6770691759732
all royal words. He heard her approach and withdraw from the partially	297.83877269110724
open door; and twice or three times he even saw the shadow of a person	321.195493563785
intercept the light.	259.29828638249967
At length a hand and an arm, surpassingly beautiful in their form and	261.9343009719469
whiteness, glided through the tapestry. D’Artagnan at once comprehended	329.8524115201629
that this was his recompense. He cast himself on his knees, seized the	193.39979616185704
hand, and touched it respectfully with his lips. Then the hand was	203.10893966034857
withdrawn, leaving in his an object which he perceived to be a ring.	330.3993118588947
The door immediately closed, and D’Artagnan found himself again in	267.1197955777368
complete obscurity.	196.6251762527422
D’Artagnan placed the ring on his finger, and again waited; it was	360.1945202115346
evident that all was not yet over. After the reward of his devotion,	170.81889441658606
that of his love was to come. Besides, although the ballet was danced,	248.6192476369599
the evening had scarcely begun. Supper was to be served at three, and	293.47712369371243
the clock of St. Jean had struck three quarters past two.	316.2849973780825
The sound of voices diminished by degrees in the adjoining chamber. The	337.0277078301882
company was then heard departing; then the door of the closet in which	345.2121167320722
D’Artagnan was, was opened, and Mme. Bonacieux entered.	268.4269687544639
“You at last?” cried D’Artagnan.	299.9817279359281
“Silence!” said the young woman, placing her hand upon his lips;	174.48243189606163
“silence, and go the same way you came!”	357.0750996732902
“But where and when shall I see you again?” cried D’Artagnan.	205.43113191713917
“A note which you will find at home will tell you. Begone, begone!”	276.86502045714286
At these words she opened the door of the corridor, and pushed	180.38860914155842
D’Artagnan out of the room. D’Artagnan obeyed like a child, without the	189.89373037787192
least resistance or objection, which proved that he was really in love.	304.60526294715146
Chapter XXIII.	260.7784462414106
THE RENDEZVOUS	199.663936558013
D’Artagnan ran home immediately, and although it was three o’clock in	232.33853348634946
the morning and he had some of the worst quarters of Paris to traverse,	281.7851730544366
he met with no misadventure. Everyone knows that drunkards and lovers	298.3074101442194
have a protecting deity.	206.66724168180397
He found the door of his passage open, sprang up the stairs and knocked	278.22578185069517
softly in a manner agreed upon between him and his lackey. Planchet*,	227.49764031209207
whom he had sent home two hours before from the Hôtel de Ville, telling	209.57460302748038
him to sit up for him, opened the door for him.	257.92340717307724
* The reader may ask, “How came Planchet here?” when he was left “stiff	179.78253538877726
as a rush” in London. In the intervening time Buckingham perhaps sent	321.0844087214788
him to Paris, as he did the horses.	338.04984587658356
“Has anyone brought a letter for me?” asked D’Artagnan, eagerly.	287.1921856446245
“No one has _brought_ a letter, monsieur,” replied Planchet; “but one	311.86437190412414
has come of itself.”	284.47924229695707
“What do you mean, blockhead?”	262.2917045265759
“I mean to say that when I came in, although I had the key of your	249.29877466386597
apartment in my pocket, and that key had never quit me, I found a	286.83564490915234
letter on the green table cover in your bedroom.”	347.4412984856902
“And where is that letter?”	201.31762568858886
“I left it where I found it, monsieur. It is not natural for letters to	353.197363189435
enter people’s houses in this manner. If the window had been open or	263.17179283488315
even ajar, I should think nothing of it; but, no—all was hermetically	286.2116346585467
sealed. Beware, monsieur; there is certainly some magic underneath.”	344.88466669359536
Meanwhile, the young man had darted in to his chamber, and opened the	262.069986272772
letter. It was from Mme. Bonacieux, and was expressed in these terms:	347.43702823423007
“There are many thanks to be offered to you, and to be transmitted to	360.96205844861356
you. Be this evening about ten o’clock at St. Cloud, in front of the	359.1199588739206
pavilion which stands at the corner of the house of M. d’Estrées.—C.B.”	330.38626741864005
While reading this letter, D’Artagnan felt his heart dilated and	232.25266085097942
compressed by that delicious spasm which tortures and caresses the	182.43715303932655
hearts of lovers.	250.89923009922418
It was the first billet he had received; it was the first rendezvous	291.6338123469369
that had been granted him. His heart, swelled by the intoxication of	270.22793830466696
joy, felt ready to dissolve away at the very gate of that terrestrial	228.79571338560444
paradise called Love!	220.9810554442442
“Well, monsieur,” said Planchet, who had observed his master grow red	364.58946859057716
and pale successively, “did I not guess truly? Is it not some bad	280.75614249459153
affair?”	169.99121002483048
“You are mistaken, Planchet,” replied D’Artagnan; “and as a proof,	365.6081845383176
there is a crown to drink my health.”	193.02682352216374
“I am much obliged to Monsieur for the crown he has given me, and I	245.5489375859376
promise him to follow his instructions exactly; but it is not the less	314.31201664770794
true that letters which come in this way into shut-up houses—”	196.38266951552885
“Fall from heaven, my friend, fall from heaven.”	295.1830582022154
“Then Monsieur is satisfied?” asked Planchet.	356.9110220931931
“My dear Planchet, I am the happiest of men!”	356.9214546405132
“And I may profit by Monsieur’s happiness, and go to bed?”	242.50342724584596
“Yes, go.”	338.05501663741177
“May the blessings of heaven fall upon Monsieur! But it is not the less	222.21085378421037
true that that letter—”	221.19257208138205
And Planchet retired, shaking his head with an air of doubt, which the	272.96684334802745
liberality of D’Artagnan had not entirely effaced.	218.5664683472857
Left alone, D’Artagnan read and reread his billet. Then he kissed and	211.41523876965158
rekissed twenty times the lines traced by the hand of his beautiful	343.12488888607305
mistress. At length he went to bed, fell asleep, and had golden dreams.	199.942269679236
At seven o’clock in the morning he arose and called Planchet, who at	322.2309755086095
the second summons opened the door, his countenance not yet quite freed	184.9412438365103
from the anxiety of the preceding night.	228.60089551739506
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, “I am going out for all day, perhaps. You	232.73229030646348
are, therefore, your own master till seven o’clock in the evening; but	329.1752918278559
at seven o’clock you must hold yourself in readiness with two horses.”	286.43979880172697
“There!” said Planchet. “We are going again, it appears, to have our	357.3765829704194
hides pierced in all sorts of ways.”	212.17152912755535
“You will take your musketoon and your pistols.”	271.1245429971019
“There, now! Didn’t I say so?” cried Planchet. “I was sure of it—the	318.90596786160813
cursed letter!”	256.44882664541797
“Don’t be afraid, you idiot; there is nothing in hand but a party of	253.7712988903047
pleasure.”	349.9459135900811
“Ah, like the charming journey the other day, when it rained bullets	174.45173540258645
and produced a crop of steel traps!”	173.0679541695964
“Well, if you are really afraid, Monsieur Planchet,” resumed	313.1846958013753
D’Artagnan, “I will go without you. I prefer traveling alone to having	208.7293794516468
a companion who entertains the least fear.”	328.6105520918836
“Monsieur does me wrong,” said Planchet; “I thought he had seen me at	283.10850773802605
work.”	268.4163264992665
“Yes, but I thought perhaps you had worn out all your courage the first	344.6818290724941
time.”	280.2165506408545
“Monsieur shall see that upon occasion I have some left; only I beg	314.43627217140704
Monsieur not to be too prodigal of it if he wishes it to last long.”	268.1538724146396
“Do you believe you have still a certain amount of it to expend this	365.5060998983876
evening?”	332.93560844605076
“I hope so, monsieur.”	250.25353407538722
“Well, then, I count on you.”	354.5074531891504
“At the appointed hour I shall be ready; only I believed that Monsieur	330.3378044382191
had but one horse in the Guard stables.”	186.87307280669364
“Perhaps there is but one at this moment; but by this evening there	299.7259387295635
will be four.”	302.81811199119556
“It appears that our journey was a remounting journey, then?”	316.45784097036494
“Exactly so,” said D’Artagnan; and nodding to Planchet, he went out.	213.94184185802487
M. Bonacieux was at his door. D’Artagnan’s intention was to go out	302.2496355816379
without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite	182.28176427824965
and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to	235.10912656824337
stop, but to enter into conversation with him.	268.6666372194309
Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a	172.71870702981255
husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same	247.7172640371907
evening at St. Cloud, opposite D’Estrées’s pavilion? D’Artagnan	365.0344714755865
approached him with the most amiable air he could assume.	177.70267922066975
The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man.	184.71218936452397
M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that D’Artagnan had overheard his	244.18384602136874
conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant	325.5555598803036
the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased	323.6412082277643
to designate, during his account, by the title of the “cardinal’s	190.9715116234946
executioner,” and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the	265.3293985238689
bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of	330.41858244729303
torture.	208.80606524544658
D’Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had	193.35925764892914
finished said, “And Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her	252.72458309971177
off?—For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the	279.2789250506151
good fortune of having made your acquaintance.”	340.67271508417855
“Ah!” said Bonacieux, “they took good care not to tell me that; and my	263.7355304262037
wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that’s sacred that she does	361.21305127505127
not know. But you,” continued M. Bonacieux, in a tone of perfect good	215.76054282976196
fellowship, “what has become of you all these days? I have not seen you	256.5865431483376
nor your friends, and I don’t think you could gather all that dust that	205.18818272140518
I saw Planchet brush off your boots yesterday from the pavement of	182.02176770473872
Paris.”	324.2671473672567
“You are right, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, my friends and I have been	173.52426753733238
on a little journey.”	306.84522045617814
“Far from here?”	335.28549360888326
“Oh, Lord, no! About forty leagues only. We went to take Monsieur Athos	222.09011772516746
to the waters of Forges, where my friends still remain.”	213.95090879410367
“And you have returned, have you not?” replied M. Bonacieux, giving to	241.96412674972345
his countenance a most sly air. “A handsome young fellow like you does	205.46154629437993
not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress; and we were	349.67279190904685
impatiently waited for at Paris, were we not?”	206.83330165195224
“My faith!” said the young man, laughing, “I confess it, and so much	266.57999457516684
more the readily, my dear Bonacieux, as I see there is no concealing	350.4475116624186
anything from you. Yes, I was expected, and very impatiently, I	225.51642059822188
acknowledge.”	179.53683091896357
A slight shade passed over the brow of Bonacieux, but so slight that	276.7911481106902
D’Artagnan did not perceive it.	345.88012389638027
“And we are going to be recompensed for our diligence?” continued the	299.86887697483985
mercer, with a trifling alteration in his voice—so trifling, indeed,	267.164038955222
that D’Artagnan did not perceive it any more than he had the momentary	341.51793313930557
shade which, an instant before, had darkened the countenance of the	181.78038882313814
worthy man.	180.1085094306144
“Ah, may you be a true prophet!” said D’Artagnan, laughing.	218.6559520542032
“No; what I say,” replied Bonacieux, “is only that I may know whether I	201.73421996379614
am delaying you.”	298.60039616691256
“Why that question, my dear host?” asked D’Artagnan. “Do you intend to	333.09442582619806
sit up for me?”	328.01787306604393
“No; but since my arrest and the robbery that was committed in my	296.16330574673225
house, I am alarmed every time I hear a door open, particularly in the	307.0412339774836
night. What the deuce can you expect? I am no swordsman.”	349.76505906206665
“Well, don’t be alarmed if I return at one, two or three o’clock in the	278.6491001932858
morning; indeed, do not be alarmed if I do not come at all.”	255.40373561281834
This time Bonacieux became so pale that D’Artagnan could not help	187.18307467514595
perceiving it, and asked him what was the matter.	323.04909965974923
“Nothing,” replied Bonacieux, “nothing. Since my misfortunes I have	340.02827949444026
been subject to faintnesses, which seize me all at once, and I have	196.0445603023142
just felt a cold shiver. Pay no attention to it; you have nothing to	217.28607570497155
occupy yourself with but being happy.”	200.78995766920724
“Then I have full occupation, for I am so.”	267.9398402426903
“Not yet; wait a little! This evening, you said.”	359.3118812774306
“Well, this evening will come, thank God! And perhaps you look for it	267.815647168621
with as much impatience as I do; perhaps this evening Madame Bonacieux	259.4607898735328
will visit the conjugal domicile.”	332.09403254772906
“Madame Bonacieux is not at liberty this evening,” replied the husband,	189.58201719664953
seriously; “she is detained at the Louvre this evening by her duties.”	248.20537682697756
“So much the worse for you, my dear host, so much the worse! When I am	326.1680472119398
happy, I wish all the world to be so; but it appears that is not	233.0815781140102
possible.”	197.55656910702405
The young man departed, laughing at the joke, which he thought he alone	200.1929718416169
could comprehend.	334.64576045591957
“Amuse yourself well!” replied Bonacieux, in a sepulchral tone.	195.18965926953547
But D’Artagnan was too far off to hear him; and if he had heard him in	169.53293129051573
the disposition of mind he then enjoyed, he certainly would not have	266.66166122217356
remarked it.	324.3429943278783
He took his way toward the hôtel of M. de Tréville; his visit of the	179.38351896309143
day before, it is to be remembered, had been very short and very little	338.19711711656
explicative.	186.48155236774667
He found Tréville in a joyful mood. He had thought the king and queen	217.8388480508115
charming at the ball. It is true the cardinal had been particularly	240.52868369108313
ill-tempered. He had retired at one o’clock under the pretense of being	281.5776778707569
indisposed. As to their Majesties, they did not return to the Louvre	256.85506381122616
till six o’clock in the morning.	249.92323549247314
“Now,” said Tréville, lowering his voice, and looking into every corner	357.7899566184743
of the apartment to see if they were alone, “now let us talk about	186.86353608054173
yourself, my young friend; for it is evident that your happy return has	213.63063379407748
something to do with the joy of the king, the triumph of the queen, and	328.50064026955226
the humiliation of his Eminence. You must look out for yourself.”	343.44012475043314
“What have I to fear,” replied D’Artagnan, “as long as I shall have the	324.32928708237614
luck to enjoy the favor of their Majesties?”	241.77066658782184
“Everything, believe me. The cardinal is not the man to forget a	237.022783508156
mystification until he has settled account with the mystifier; and the	285.58337712743037
mystifier appears to me to have the air of being a certain young Gascon	308.6934304214677
of my acquaintance.”	345.2327428512589
“Do you believe that the cardinal is as well posted as yourself, and	354.03436830526744
knows that I have been to London?”	172.26597955139746
“The devil! You have been to London! Was it from London you brought	242.66156134038897
that beautiful diamond that glitters on your finger? Beware, my dear	248.94880103970146
D’Artagnan! A present from an enemy is not a good thing. Are there not	221.51587246182083
some Latin verses upon that subject? Stop!”	213.54461357820546
“Yes, doubtless,” replied D’Artagnan, who had never been able to cram	316.13271770812577
the first rudiments of that language into his head, and who had by his	268.3932745960414
ignorance driven his master to despair, “yes, doubtless there is one.”	291.7173371391708
“There certainly is one,” said M. de Tréville, who had a tincture of	214.6189669877339
literature, “and Monsieur de Benserade was quoting it to me the other	316.30844556672054
day. Stop a minute—ah, this is it: ‘Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,’	191.27299085715507
which means, ‘Beware of the enemy who makes you presents.”	219.9006608019482
“This diamond does not come from an enemy, monsieur,” replied	316.84965255769464
D’Artagnan, “it comes from the queen.”	178.60040124060205
“From the queen! Oh, oh!” said M. de Tréville. “Why, it is indeed a	212.4770356247555
true royal jewel, which is worth a thousand pistoles if it is worth a	327.54903836991224
denier. By whom did the queen send you this jewel?”	201.43812300977595
“She gave it to me herself.”	233.16576030763298
“Where?”	209.55593534496148
“In the room adjoining the chamber in which she changed her toilet.”	351.7243774879993
“How?”	241.39884655796578
“Giving me her hand to kiss.”	294.3952979355313
“You have kissed the queen’s hand?” said M. de Tréville, looking	351.07459094277556
earnestly at D’Artagnan.	166.41404430439195
“Her Majesty did me the honor to grant me that favor.”	293.7531979340322
“And that in the presence of witnesses! Imprudent, thrice imprudent!”	316.21544391751615
“No, monsieur, be satisfied; nobody saw her,” replied D’Artagnan, and	305.61731885201124
he related to M. de Tréville how the affair came to pass.	257.5696153258524
“Oh, the women, the women!” cried the old soldier. “I know them by	239.84659675059677
their romantic imagination. Everything that savors of mystery charms	303.9335928309389
them. So you have seen the arm, that was all. You would meet the queen,	233.71950439549698
and she would not know who you are?”	337.695947351687
“No; but thanks to this diamond,” replied the young man.	242.746918997842
“Listen,” said M. de Tréville; “shall I give you counsel, good counsel,	364.62343794457894
the counsel of a friend?”	296.858562634094
“You will do me honor, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan.	287.3827147614794
“Well, then, off to the nearest goldsmith’s, and sell that diamond for	188.9332588689317
the highest price you can get from him. However much of a Jew he may	232.43910532643034
be, he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no	297.00387761586285
name, young man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him	198.13826440340955
who wears it.”	216.0713778088409
“Sell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign? Never!” said	303.82950156641346
D’Artagnan.	365.05104624663124
“Then, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody	170.405634013298
must be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in	269.2094068104888
his mother’s jewel case.”	254.9935378289431
“You think, then, I have something to dread?” asked D’Artagnan.	277.6646300978083
“I mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine the match of	235.3904660514882
which is already lighted, may consider himself in safety in comparison	299.6718206204392
with you.”	169.6166231765135
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, whom the positive tone of M. de Tréville	321.77038391214285
began to disquiet, “the devil! What must I do?”	338.3642891849628
“Above all things be always on your guard. The cardinal has a tenacious	229.39651626552268
memory and a long arm; you may depend upon it, he will repay you by	202.022870374536
some ill turn.”	219.18665006495226
“But of what sort?”	189.69462537191907
“Eh! How can I tell? Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his	273.7386909268126
command? The least that can be expected is that you will be arrested.”	183.46862796612785
“What! Will they dare to arrest a man in his Majesty’s service?”	195.0948007487085
“_Pardieu!_ They did not scruple much in the case of Athos. At all	269.9015820950795
events, young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do	353.67179663682657
not lull yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the	318.72438514544876
contrary—and it is I who say it—see enemies in all directions. If	212.7326542769717
anyone seeks a quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten	356.05246303673107
years old. If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat,	358.23575276861504
without shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your	343.46528268559416
foot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house	328.6020146131935
which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your	311.423214887061
head; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let	336.831356388895
your lackey be armed—if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey.	291.6111610170359
Mistrust everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress—your	321.4848762327824
mistress above all.”	176.15564035402662
D’Artagnan blushed.	235.02329271576153
“My mistress above all,” repeated he, mechanically; “and why her rather	251.35070073208158
than another?”	222.56804773069456
“Because a mistress is one of the cardinal’s favorite means; he has not	242.90894510552312
one that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles,	227.9464110580285
witness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?”	345.5100181355804
D’Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme. Bonacieux had made with him	273.30423909854886
for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our	199.294566596373
hero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Tréville of women in	303.39701913278316
general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty	288.48660725386867
hostess.	308.66451310320406
“But, _à propos_,” resumed M. de Tréville, “what has become of your	292.4441182175756
three companions?”	334.50241811710225
“I was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?”	324.8859038059577
“None, monsieur.”	226.88563305495296
“Well, I left them on my road—Porthos at Chantilly, with a duel on his	334.8785263080772
hands; Aramis at Crèvecœur, with a ball in his shoulder; and Athos at	210.60777761756745
Amiens, detained by an accusation of coining.”	194.25921353802707
“See there, now!” said M. de Tréville; “and how the devil did you	296.2064645141258
escape?”	329.5925090974258
“By a miracle, monsieur, I must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my	304.17194809593104
breast, and by nailing the Comte de Wardes on the byroad to Calais,	176.85262431185836
like a butterfly on a tapestry.”	268.9708797291368
“There again! De Wardes, one of the cardinal’s men, a cousin of	205.533019718292
Rochefort! Stop, my friend, I have an idea.”	356.2945210070884
“Speak, monsieur.”	225.08758322881593
“In your place, I would do one thing.”	208.12754932524115
“What?”	323.7360634017365
“While his Eminence was seeking for me in Paris, I would take, without	335.7421138647681
sound of drum or trumpet, the road to Picardy, and would go and make	324.73371479975765
some inquiries concerning my three companions. What the devil! They	312.8250791227133
merit richly that piece of attention on your part.”	354.97020758003185
“The advice is good, monsieur, and tomorrow I will set out.”	306.97114120860147
“Tomorrow! Any why not this evening?”	329.7377493356548
“This evening, monsieur, I am detained in Paris by indispensable	174.96164063748304
business.”	245.49684764775932
“Ah, young man, young man, some flirtation or other. Take care, I	355.226974444354
repeat to you, take care. It is woman who has ruined us, still ruins	166.9601057825179
us, and will ruin us, as long as the world stands. Take my advice and	288.51769563899103
set out this evening.”	258.8124838792605
“Impossible, monsieur.”	284.2002020213386
“You have given your word, then?”	187.6818709956463
“Yes, monsieur.”	257.1269759523021
“Ah, that’s quite another thing; but promise me, if you should not be	186.68021562129536
killed tonight, that you will go tomorrow.”	301.6255362362
“I promise it.”	221.83588331513357
“Do you need money?”	217.79097039515293
“I have still fifty pistoles. That, I think, is as much as I shall	365.21258658409045
want.”	351.7213305528164
“But your companions?”	342.809136821931
“I don’t think they can be in need of any. We left Paris, each with	341.1437617224328
seventy-five pistoles in his pocket.”	177.3507734231376
“Shall I see you again before your departure?”	237.50398239856534
“I think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen.”	359.9115090302754
“Well, a pleasant journey.”	171.01175399874225
“Thanks, monsieur.”	170.53688742379535
D’Artagnan left M. de Tréville, touched more than ever by his paternal	285.175307296554
solicitude for his Musketeers.	334.1548264361585
He called successively at the abodes of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.	312.730487900801
Neither of them had returned. Their lackeys likewise were absent, and	248.06074315168334
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. He would have	202.28181692638125
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted	274.5177092368885
with Porthos’s nor Aramis’s, and as to Athos, he had none.	279.29465469021
As he passed the Hôtel des Gardes, he took a glance into the stables.	262.4674855813523
Three of the four horses had already arrived. Planchet, all	191.65212554573148
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.	305.70621385817424
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, on perceiving D’Artagnan, “how glad I am	186.23060503446638
to see you.”	323.1603296813537
“Why so, Planchet?” asked the young man.	338.44392843300795
“Do you place confidence in our landlord—Monsieur Bonacieux?”	205.80765916338424
“I? Not the least in the world.”	317.01294445705645
“Oh, you do quite right, monsieur.”	206.39766364811103
“But why this question?”	362.8102239125535
“Because, while you were talking with him, I watched you without	269.0081374726905
listening to you; and, monsieur, his countenance changed color two or	361.4713924235199
three times!”	236.76801499027428
“Bah!”	175.978396391399
“Preoccupied as Monsieur was with the letter he had received, he did	237.44838698155633
not observe that; but I, whom the strange fashion in which that letter	229.2965847581644
came into the house had placed on my guard—I did not lose a movement of	279.39645302884924
his features.”	203.54953659310206
“And you found it?”	253.42344273519683
“Traitorous, monsieur.”	323.68291769886275
“Indeed!”	280.97480764302134
“Still more; as soon as Monsieur had left and disappeared round the	186.47689055904965
corner of the street, Monsieur Bonacieux took his hat, shut his door,	302.05684167606444
and set off at a quick pace in an opposite direction.”	278.5131899456179
“It seems you are right, Planchet; all this appears to be a little	266.8125912590218
mysterious; and be assured that we will not pay him our rent until the	258.38787703397213
matter shall be categorically explained to us.”	243.7166218072556
“Monsieur jests, but Monsieur will see.”	338.2063895656453
“What would you have, Planchet? What must come is written.”	195.49236832282173
“Monsieur does not then renounce his excursion for this evening?”	285.0502567645095
“Quite the contrary, Planchet; the more ill will I have toward Monsieur	182.74943704492355
Bonacieux, the more punctual I shall be in keeping the appointment made	335.42335213450866
by that letter which makes you so uneasy.”	199.22145140434654
“Then that is Monsieur’s determination?”	260.5595586215793
“Undeniably, my friend. At nine o’clock, then, be ready here at the	358.2430742697845
hôtel, I will come and take you.”	237.3699006565351
Planchet seeing there was no longer any hope of making his master	357.3720390259886
renounce his project, heaved a profound sigh and set to work to groom	259.4908371071066
the third horse.	278.15392152334243
As to D’Artagnan, being at bottom a prudent youth, instead of returning	332.7186790284434
home, went and dined with the Gascon priest, who, at the time of the	269.1584273195391
distress of the four friends, had given them a breakfast of chocolate.	224.93454122861885
Chapter XXIV.	307.7731339560873
THE PAVILION	182.41227932892414
At nine o’clock D’Artagnan was at the Hôtel des Gardes; he found	228.79656107608588
Planchet all ready. The fourth horse had arrived.	249.44615308486902
Planchet was armed with his musketoon and a pistol. D’Artagnan had his	265.8442949856744
sword and placed two pistols in his belt; then both mounted and	359.0254663663294
departed quietly. It was quite dark, and no one saw them go out.	178.85548240974285
Planchet took place behind his master, and kept at a distance of ten	353.7382722616895
paces from him.	208.60651195106192
D’Artagnan crossed the quays, went out by the gate of La Conférence and	335.304502525207
followed the road, much more beautiful then than it is now, which leads	278.2035783019962
to St. Cloud.	291.7759827206628
As long as he was in the city, Planchet kept at the respectful distance	340.39958677185086
he had imposed upon himself; but as soon as the road began to be more	354.85672986582216
lonely and dark, he drew softly nearer, so that when they entered the	262.9305406440756
Bois de Boulogne he found himself riding quite naturally side by side	334.1982901237734
with his master. In fact, we must not dissemble that the oscillation of	341.8564752432717
the tall trees and the reflection of the moon in the dark underwood	190.37526056173704
gave him serious uneasiness. D’Artagnan could not help perceiving that	338.0728775209625
something more than usual was passing in the mind of his lackey and	303.1086242465049
said, “Well, Monsieur Planchet, what is the matter with us now?”	183.40233874668525
“Don’t you think, monsieur, that woods are like churches?”	213.15682646790142
“How so, Planchet?”	299.04274852261904
“Because we dare not speak aloud in one or the other.”	355.5720535199399
“But why did you not dare to speak aloud, Planchet—because you are	206.0690028493563
afraid?”	316.03643429419435
“Afraid of being heard? Yes, monsieur.”	284.24302417257115
“Afraid of being heard! Why, there is nothing improper in our	260.5616188838304
conversation, my dear Planchet, and no one could find fault with it.”	260.43165170178804
“Ah, monsieur!” replied Planchet, recurring to his besetting idea,	262.1272781742311
“that Monsieur Bonacieux has something vicious in his eyebrows, and	260.8316974164228
something very unpleasant in the play of his lips.”	292.40399229311174
“What the devil makes you think of Bonacieux?”	284.36408680856573
“Monsieur, we think of what we can, and not of what we will.”	169.05763994217253
“Because you are a coward, Planchet.”	240.86307925952258
“Monsieur, we must not confound prudence with cowardice; prudence is a	211.79066657327303
virtue.”	314.4087567454791
“And you are very virtuous, are you not, Planchet?”	175.83059973999127
“Monsieur, is not that the barrel of a musket which glitters yonder?	246.8551112228081
Had we not better lower our heads?”	330.59299964857234
“In truth,” murmured D’Artagnan, to whom M. de Tréville’s	205.7490029752987
recommendation recurred, “this animal will end by making me afraid.”	214.25977189494674
And he put his horse into a trot.	292.5804102784655
Planchet followed the movements of his master as if he had been his	207.0080973392285
shadow, and was soon trotting by his side.	175.8226733323879
“Are we going to continue this pace all night?” asked Planchet.	258.50693214536307
“No; you are at your journey’s end.”	241.28145184207716
“How, monsieur! And you?”	238.04127482541838
“I am going a few steps farther.”	333.28888523564103
“And Monsieur leaves me here alone?”	209.59168370712663
“You are afraid, Planchet?”	359.30558761146347
“No; I only beg leave to observe to Monsieur that the night will be	277.0561531540477
very cold, that chills bring on rheumatism, and that a lackey who has	259.443794654856
the rheumatism makes but a poor servant, particularly to a master as	223.7120214360333
active as Monsieur.”	174.5464651148316
“Well, if you are cold, Planchet, you can go into one of those cabarets	341.89607257644775
that you see yonder, and be in waiting for me at the door by six	250.52069861075182
o’clock in the morning.”	280.10197675667234
“Monsieur, I have eaten and drunk respectfully the crown you gave me	208.62693492575423
this morning, so that I have not a sou left in case I should be cold.”	352.57693889096436
“Here’s half a pistole. Tomorrow morning.”	195.85557818473
D’Artagnan sprang from his horse, threw the bridle to Planchet, and	354.31708574796994
departed at a quick pace, folding his cloak around him.	359.1199522850394
“Good Lord, how cold I am!” cried Planchet, as soon as he had lost	307.5067054678442
sight of his master; and in such haste was he to warm himself that he	292.8161465737887
went straight to a house set out with all the attributes of a suburban	251.2897809851508
tavern, and knocked at the door.	300.59656555203526
In the meantime D’Artagnan, who had plunged into a bypath, continued	292.7182604773619
his route and reached St. Cloud; but instead of following the main	361.3325636681841
street he turned behind the château, reached a sort of retired lane,	200.0406818113289
and found himself soon in front of the pavilion named. It was situated	190.80520959426133
in a very private spot. A high wall, at the angle of which was the	297.2450373864713
pavilion, ran along one side of this lane, and on the other was a	330.0674281652798
little garden connected with a poor cottage which was protected by a	272.72684421213484
hedge from passers-by.	332.66276201170365
He gained the place appointed, and as no signal had been given him by	227.70193795848442
which to announce his presence, he waited.	178.47024738698906
Not the least noise was to be heard; it might be imagined that he was a	237.67589405995503
hundred miles from the capital. D’Artagnan leaned against the hedge,	248.48006869265762
after having cast a glance behind it. Beyond that hedge, that garden,	170.71230806183777
and that cottage, a dark mist enveloped with its folds that immensity	275.8515042289779
where Paris slept—a vast void from which glittered a few luminous	218.16328251155454
points, the funeral stars of that hell!	301.4413004111789
But for D’Artagnan all aspects were clothed happily, all ideas wore a	173.53838042099312
smile, all shades were diaphanous. The appointed hour was about to	317.74854646788833
strike. In fact, at the end of a few minutes the belfry of St. Cloud	187.18390271906435
let fall slowly ten strokes from its sonorous jaws. There was something	181.86365454862695
melancholy in this brazen voice pouring out its lamentations in the	230.69922689838282
middle of the night; but each of those strokes, which made up the	276.13952030247634
expected hour, vibrated harmoniously to the heart of the young man.	271.14826357719323
His eyes were fixed upon the little pavilion situated at the angle of	207.88424639820644
the wall, of which all the windows were closed with shutters, except	298.2562272132475
one on the first story. Through this window shone a mild light which	222.87466523847905
silvered the foliage of two or three linden trees which formed a group	312.0213948521473
outside the park. There could be no doubt that behind this little	233.47450145626712
window, which threw forth such friendly beams, the pretty Mme.	320.87690864291676
Bonacieux expected him.	334.2034503796474
Wrapped in this sweet idea, D’Artagnan waited half an hour without the	230.19386241475524
least impatience, his eyes fixed upon that charming little abode of	288.7493486186429
which he could perceive a part of the ceiling with its gilded moldings,	340.9533282869375
attesting the elegance of the rest of the apartment.	354.1908204385443
The belfry of St. Cloud sounded half past ten.	282.03298591075543
This time, without knowing why, D’Artagnan felt a cold shiver run	224.7823670485599
through his veins. Perhaps the cold began to affect him, and he took a	205.4798526576097
perfectly physical sensation for a moral impression.	176.0355149929059
Then the idea seized him that he had read incorrectly, and that the	236.63833336789696
appointment was for eleven o’clock. He drew near to the window, and	321.63403265285865
placing himself so that a ray of light should fall upon the letter as	208.1726565106377
he held it, he drew it from his pocket and read it again; but he had	221.23103356463284
not been mistaken, the appointment was for ten o’clock. He went and	290.46924348793186
resumed his post, beginning to be rather uneasy at this silence and	182.25157642653596
this solitude.	209.5229749540491
Eleven o’clock sounded.	335.787078392318
D’Artagnan began now really to fear that something had happened to Mme.	322.3862920156082
Bonacieux. He clapped his hands three times—the ordinary signal of	303.5203673411338
lovers; but nobody replied to him, not even an echo.	322.3526837458728
He then thought, with a touch of vexation, that perhaps the young woman	282.59515096926816
had fallen asleep while waiting for him. He approached the wall, and	277.75439378300655
tried to climb it; but the wall had been recently pointed, and	242.87200853501213
D’Artagnan could get no hold.	249.70750964382825
At that moment he thought of the trees, upon whose leaves the light	173.5709428536189
still shone; and as one of them drooped over the road, he thought that	355.4929569994966
from its branches he might get a glimpse of the interior of the	197.88691647572745
pavilion.	210.23031157517588
The tree was easy to climb. Besides, D’Artagnan was but twenty years	232.8820944670927
old, and consequently had not yet forgotten his schoolboy habits. In an	318.6149183866034
instant he was among the branches, and his keen eyes plunged through	296.49365879726986
the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion.	223.1361842695938
It was a strange thing, and one which made D’Artagnan tremble from the	297.28449535162076
sole of his foot to the roots of his hair, to find that this soft	297.89447052600167
light, this calm lamp, enlightened a scene of fearful disorder. One of	350.90585159209206
the windows was broken, the door of the chamber had been beaten in and	246.19162309314527
hung, split in two, on its hinges. A table, which had been covered with	248.461446101089
an elegant supper, was overturned. The decanters broken in pieces, and	300.09384951853673
the fruits crushed, strewed the floor. Everything in the apartment gave	267.24356185710883
evidence of a violent and desperate struggle. D’Artagnan even fancied	317.0154297099456
he could recognize amid this strange disorder, fragments of garments,	289.3661005175942
and some bloody spots staining the cloth and the curtains. He hastened	299.6671507646803
to descend into the street, with a frightful beating at his heart; he	227.79038863848572
wished to see if he could find other traces of violence.	352.5434955589293
The little soft light shone on in the calmness of the night. D’Artagnan	355.8650316011534
then perceived a thing that he had not before remarked—for nothing had	205.52842448552056
led him to the examination—that the ground, trampled here and	199.31770618169176
hoofmarked there, presented confused traces of men and horses. Besides,	212.2617342086754
the wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had	350.71488428009616
made a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond	218.15310069890342
the pavilion, but turned again toward Paris.	348.31141714879436
At length D’Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a	275.3293551019466
woman’s torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy	284.15874293653724
ground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves	339.65667351185795
that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand.	208.49671050769166
As D’Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy	357.2317654157857
sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed	338.05240191553276
by a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet he	297.0843872798173
said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in	180.41119009029467
common with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an	190.64876293115182
appointment with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that	229.22399370233097
she might have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the	351.2299970808982
jealousy of her husband.	266.19025040316035
But all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that	208.05750718239028
feeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession	313.3828107226643
of our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that	311.3715656001694
some great misfortune is hanging over us.	183.33167599504716
Then D’Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took	261.50397795943337
the path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the	206.66583696335255
boatman.	321.7365596933682
About seven o’clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young	234.20881412977127
woman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not	324.63685291748936
to be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the	241.63274704520126
boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was	184.9195343518362
young and pretty.	166.59204127063418
There were then, as now, a crowd of young and pretty women who came to	278.8520662240336
St. Cloud, and who had reasons for not being seen, and yet D’Artagnan	255.569012588271
did not for an instant doubt that it was Mme. Bonacieux whom the	262.5261532282553
boatman had noticed.	251.67799221051746
D’Artagnan took advantage of the lamp which burned in the cabin of the	307.73163957033125
ferryman to read the billet of Mme. Bonacieux once again, and satisfy	212.2828008012451
himself that he had not been mistaken, that the appointment was at St.	210.73512087240468
Cloud and not elsewhere, before the D’Estrées’s pavilion and not in	251.52630937917127
another street. Everything conspired to prove to D’Artagnan that his	192.6315405046429
presentiments had not deceived him, and that a great misfortune had	326.68741470183727
happened.	185.036910187417
He again ran back to the château. It appeared to him that something	311.480244174773
might have happened at the pavilion in his absence, and that fresh	259.55654312703894
information awaited him. The lane was still deserted, and the same calm	333.8114725793949
soft light shone through the window.	167.25774284777225
D’Artagnan then thought of that cottage, silent and obscure, which had	281.2270717342366
no doubt seen all, and could tell its tale. The gate of the enclosure	360.58858890598583
was shut; but he leaped over the hedge, and in spite of the barking of	338.9418632187784
a chained-up dog, went up to the cabin.	259.5054353176073
No one answered to his first knocking. A silence of death reigned in	194.88879938182197
the cabin as in the pavilion; but as the cabin was his last resource,	221.50583849675525
he knocked again.	245.87755941884814
It soon appeared to him that he heard a slight noise within—a timid	207.21785404710548
noise which seemed to tremble lest it should be heard.	190.71553935498588
Then D’Artagnan ceased knocking, and prayed with an accent so full of	182.4972029556647
anxiety and promises, terror and cajolery, that his voice was of a	183.34610324277145
nature to reassure the most fearful. At length an old, worm-eaten	334.3298463215088
shutter was opened, or rather pushed ajar, but closed again as soon as	283.1794880305382
the light from a miserable lamp which burned in the corner had shone	240.22376426805198
upon the baldric, sword belt, and pistol pommels of D’Artagnan.	203.79869363292363
Nevertheless, rapid as the movement had been, D’Artagnan had had time	219.40341856365822
to get a glimpse of the head of an old man.	286.0977071031019
“In the name of heaven!” cried he, “listen to me; I have been waiting	239.5882861060415
for someone who has not come. I am dying with anxiety. Has anything	324.5937983796007
particular happened in the neighborhood? Speak!”	226.11172316882022
The window was again opened slowly, and the same face appeared, only it	233.1458153745973
was now still more pale than before.	339.78249196381114
D’Artagnan related his story simply, with the omission of names. He	233.97127607844095
told how he had a rendezvous with a young woman before that pavilion,	338.55048171117096
and how, not seeing her come, he had climbed the linden tree, and by	250.86218627895755
the light of the lamp had seen the disorder of the chamber.	364.54929034296015
The old man listened attentively, making a sign only that it was all	203.74978842405488
so; and then, when D’Artagnan had ended, he shook his head with an air	184.36492347093613
that announced nothing good.	296.57353220281874
“What do you mean?” cried D’Artagnan. “In the name of heaven, explain	294.6829615972521
yourself!”	214.14081206913278
“Oh! Monsieur,” said the old man, “ask me nothing; for if I dared tell	347.9010003133942
you what I have seen, certainly no good would befall me.”	287.981874064629
“You have, then, seen something?” replied D’Artagnan. “In that case, in	264.20734537915354
the name of heaven,” continued he, throwing him a pistole, “tell me	224.3524767881852
what you have seen, and I will pledge you the word of a gentleman that	247.76143640645302
not one of your words shall escape from my heart.”	220.37762480828889
The old man read so much truth and so much grief in the face of the	223.80732246507742
young man that he made him a sign to listen, and repeated in a low	226.55288517335276
voice: “It was scarcely nine o’clock when I heard a noise in the	218.87089094092372
street, and was wondering what it could be, when on coming to my door,	234.63825044174467
I found that somebody was endeavoring to open it. As I am very poor and	180.12509237211177
am not afraid of being robbed, I went and opened the gate and saw three	273.02540165358334
men at a few paces from it. In the shadow was a carriage with two	259.9003945726166
horses, and some saddlehorses. These horses evidently belonged to the	278.9186369485081
three men, who were dressed as cavaliers. ‘Ah, my worthy gentlemen,’	287.3311367162322
cried I, ‘what do you want?’ ‘You must have a ladder?’ said he who	230.06666707027782
appeared to be the leader of the party. ‘Yes, monsieur, the one with	282.6279350956163
which I gather my fruit.’ ‘Lend it to us, and go into your house again;	315.86196143887577
there is a crown for the annoyance we have caused you. Only remember	217.14450391010732
this—if you speak a word of what you may see or what you may hear (for	320.4650162098503
you will look and you will listen, I am quite sure, however we may	342.6075688163877
threaten you), you are lost.’ At these words he threw me a crown, which	233.25956270313839
I picked up, and he took the ladder. After shutting the gate behind	275.279742416646
them, I pretended to return to the house, but I immediately went out a	335.50119196260033
back door, and stealing along in the shade of the hedge, I gained	189.70146736297897
yonder clump of elder, from which I could hear and see everything. The	226.07308259898844
three men brought the carriage up quietly, and took out of it a little	174.3006392185136
man, stout, short, elderly, and commonly dressed in clothes of a dark	299.9489545160029
color, who ascended the ladder very carefully, looked suspiciously in	285.7701740495243
at the window of the pavilion, came down as quietly as he had gone up,	347.7475023134464
and whispered, ‘It is she!’ Immediately, he who had spoken to me	327.7912786569714
approached the door of the pavilion, opened it with a key he had in his	280.81473050334785
hand, closed the door and disappeared, while at the same time the other	259.7107817193133
two men ascended the ladder. The little old man remained at the coach	218.69719753313314
door; the coachman took care of his horses, the lackey held the	238.7612133694588
saddlehorses. All at once great cries resounded in the pavilion, and a	276.8923125165717
woman came to the window, and opened it, as if to throw herself out of	271.2679830747029
it; but as soon as she perceived the other two men, she fell back and	340.8522086317579
they went into the chamber. Then I saw no more; but I heard the noise	218.9877380646294
of breaking furniture. The woman screamed, and cried for help; but her	328.5415594204045
cries were soon stifled. Two of the men appeared, bearing the woman in	279.0170788362831
their arms, and carried her to the carriage, into which the little old	282.23292834872814
man got after her. The leader closed the window, came out an instant	364.5230899764791
after by the door, and satisfied himself that the woman was in the	316.65877541438454
carriage. His two companions were already on horseback. He sprang into	195.95703569177005
his saddle; the lackey took his place by the coachman; the carriage	243.37937443771858
went off at a quick pace, escorted by the three horsemen, and all was	198.19706852830336
over. From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything.”	268.23575150971624
D’Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained	289.7045163788697
motionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were	252.29136022882898
howling in his heart.	319.2639693599657
“But, my good gentleman,” resumed the old man, upon whom this mute	201.00597100255985
despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would	186.19637287113846
have done, “do not take on so; they did not kill her, and that’s a	357.8190578876642
comfort.”	304.69027218435815
“Can you guess,” said D’Artagnan, “who was the man who headed this	170.06986559772167
infernal expedition?”	293.36612367353234
“I don’t know him.”	228.45699447050757
“But as you spoke to him you must have seen him.”	224.02224360616572
“Oh, it’s a description you want?”	202.95565374219126
“Exactly so.”	189.8289799710614
“A tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a	236.96115550947317
gentleman.”	181.40533975247592
“That’s the man!” cried D’Artagnan, “again he, forever he! He is my	190.45194078614196
demon, apparently. And the other?”	302.42648103674287
“Which?”	298.52468077445997
“The short one.”	308.1176214484479
“Oh, he was not a gentleman, I’ll answer for it; besides, he did not	340.81771707375196
wear a sword, and the others treated him with small consideration.”	169.5597625415843
“Some lackey,” murmured D’Artagnan. “Poor woman, poor woman, what have	288.0670424680471
they done with you?”	198.13830468865336
“You have promised to be secret, my good monsieur?” said the old man.	239.357922920014
“And I renew my promise. Be easy, I am a gentleman. A gentleman has but	259.38022653016947
his word, and I have given you mine.”	246.5839988466465
With a heavy heart, D’Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry.	282.5023127776277
Sometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should	169.02006529851482
find her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an	217.8648572466543
intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and	186.44523558021734
carried her off. His mind was torn by doubt, grief, and despair.	255.0308008827535
“Oh, if I had my three friends here,” cried he, “I should have, at	272.94808882914697
least, some hopes of finding her; but who knows what has become of	348.570229685883
them?”	181.1642517865983
It was past midnight; the next thing was to find Planchet. D’Artagnan	315.234539016725
went successively into all the cabarets in which there was a light, but	265.71162584196054
could not find Planchet in any of them.	334.3782689994142
At the sixth he began to reflect that the search was rather dubious.	284.6401191796832
D’Artagnan had appointed six o’clock in the morning for his lackey, and	202.0437280086351
wherever he might be, he was right.	338.98359740005617
Besides, it came into the young man’s mind that by remaining in the	202.28282464572624
environs of the spot on which this sad event had passed, he would,	352.2999320657058
perhaps, have some light thrown upon the mysterious affair. At the	281.04833853753183
sixth cabaret, then, as we said, D’Artagnan stopped, asked for a bottle	293.052607968773
of wine of the best quality, and placing himself in the darkest corner	317.5033686419206
of the room, determined thus to wait till daylight; but this time again	315.08956215448967
his hopes were disappointed, and although he listened with all his	351.2108285170268
ears, he heard nothing, amid the oaths, coarse jokes, and abuse which	253.12234661085023
passed between the laborers, servants, and carters who comprised the	184.67845419527038
honorable society of which he formed a part, which could put him upon	327.32860975549363
the least track of her who had been stolen from him. He was compelled,	189.5983323390319
then, after having swallowed the contents of his bottle, to pass the	194.60923201391796
time as well as to evade suspicion, to fall into the easiest position	171.25420910792155
in his corner and to sleep, whether well or ill. D’Artagnan, be it	294.8003986538615
remembered, was only twenty years old, and at that age sleep has its	257.8180100346281
imprescriptible rights which it imperiously insists upon, even with the	347.61029642830056
saddest hearts.	294.0927032628398
Toward six o’clock D’Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling	333.9622132313775
which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was	185.33779581375143
not long in making his toilet. He examined himself to see if advantage	274.026294622098
had been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his	185.28535515207432
finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose,	217.75959424007618
paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better	341.8143161749105
luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before.	300.98731796735854
The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest	334.97979952981757
Planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of	289.8790956469144
a little blind cabaret, before which D’Artagnan had passed without even	339.3971873764617
a suspicion of its existence.	262.7189905368362
Chapter XXV.	236.26939005303734
PORTHOS	350.9717820232885
Instead of returning directly home, D’Artagnan alighted at the door of	218.44358932016004
M. de Tréville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided	314.10915171425756
to relate all that had passed. M. de Tréville would doubtless give him	178.4306612536932
good advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Tréville saw the	169.70735284890924
queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some	168.89989122661032
intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making	175.6391782507246
pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress.	184.99895016739714
M. de Tréville listened to the young man’s account with a seriousness	337.1947886739363
which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a	195.0156375971438
love affair. When D’Artagnan had finished, he said, “Hum! All this	243.86850611531926
savors of his Eminence, a league off.”	362.5556123546917
“But what is to be done?” said D’Artagnan.	292.08601245813804
“Nothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told	279.1833241301132
you, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her	347.42505886901773
the details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no	285.41135773883695
doubt ignorant. These details will guide her on her part, and on your	254.6179157412601
return, I shall perhaps have some good news to tell you. Rely on me.”	334.1281632376812
D’Artagnan knew that, although a Gascon, M. de Tréville was not in the	260.00065302595453
habit of making promises, and that when by chance he did promise, he	174.04900109167286
more than kept his word. He bowed to him, then, full of gratitude for	295.66819314892234
the past and for the future; and the worthy captain, who on his side	166.93790208152524
felt a lively interest in this young man, so brave and so resolute,	234.786826143702
pressed his hand kindly, wishing him a pleasant journey.	234.142877480889
Determined to put the advice of M. de Tréville in practice instantly,	255.77512316094248
D’Artagnan directed his course toward the Rue des Fossoyeurs, in order	360.451531157463
to superintend the packing of his valise. On approaching the house, he	299.3942147672848
perceived M. Bonacieux in morning costume, standing at his threshold.	287.89266891101306
All that the prudent Planchet had said to him the preceding evening	225.47934577558684
about the sinister character of the old man recurred to the mind of	199.0960038704461
D’Artagnan, who looked at him with more attention than he had done	323.7275685591851
before. In fact, in addition to that yellow, sickly paleness which	247.18965341754654
indicates the insinuation of the bile in the blood, and which might,	201.0915048379884
besides, be accidental, D’Artagnan remarked something perfidiously	214.24643764877231
significant in the play of the wrinkled features of his countenance. A	353.2895732839624
rogue does not laugh in the same way that an honest man does; a	325.5271607110112
hypocrite does not shed the tears of a man of good faith. All falsehood	250.08305003008851
is a mask; and however well made the mask may be, with a little	359.922655088831
attention we may always succeed in distinguishing it from the true	308.29880093600565
face.	339.10000503882856
It appeared, then, to D’Artagnan that M. Bonacieux wore a mask, and	335.0246472386805
likewise that that mask was most disagreeable to look upon. In	298.5793271045604
consequence of this feeling of repugnance, he was about to pass without	172.23849415746326
speaking to him, but, as he had done the day before, M. Bonacieux	198.3828993744578
accosted him.	232.40267510884
“Well, young man,” said he, “we appear to pass rather gay nights! Seven	265.6519974411915
o’clock in the morning! _Peste!_ You seem to reverse ordinary customs,	169.1055546963209
and come home at the hour when other people are going out.”	220.41798456536623
“No one can reproach you for anything of the kind, Monsieur Bonacieux,”	205.48040350187338
said the young man; “you are a model for regular people. It is true	333.401301618476
that when a man possesses a young and pretty wife, he has no need to	196.95075934971103
seek happiness elsewhere. Happiness comes to meet him, does it not,	183.86109412349566
Monsieur Bonacieux?”	201.67660011986612
Bonacieux became as pale as death, and grinned a ghastly smile.	265.52030437360713
“Ah, ah!” said Bonacieux, “you are a jocular companion! But where the	338.48774367132273
devil were you gadding last night, my young master? It does not appear	354.94217850166876
to be very clean in the crossroads.”	360.1126410306709
D’Artagnan glanced down at his boots, all covered with mud; but that	246.44819423424104
same glance fell upon the shoes and stockings of the mercer, and it	308.342978435341
might have been said they had been dipped in the same mud heap. Both	220.78650688508296
were stained with splashes of mud of the same appearance.	299.61749915450787
Then a sudden idea crossed the mind of D’Artagnan. That little stout	257.5537016204991
man, short and elderly, that sort of lackey, dressed in dark clothes,	305.04096772935134
treated without ceremony by the men wearing swords who composed the	330.6548079841668
escort, was Bonacieux himself. The husband had presided at the	347.68212168871446
abduction of his wife.	249.62201122284245
A terrible inclination seized D’Artagnan to grasp the mercer by the	176.9098542789228
throat and strangle him; but, as we have said, he was a very prudent	317.57953131169364
youth, and he restrained himself. However, the revolution which	272.3231621670818
appeared upon his countenance was so visible that Bonacieux was	290.6151992008561
terrified at it, and he endeavored to draw back a step or two; but as	216.48753412592063
he was standing before the half of the door which was shut, the	291.21062957019853
obstacle compelled him to keep his place.	320.3780308899255
“Ah, but you are joking, my worthy man!” said D’Artagnan. “It appears	330.787410143448
to me that if my boots need a sponge, your stockings and shoes stand in	311.57028020848446
equal need of a brush. May you not have been philandering a little	353.34991685589864
also, Monsieur Bonacieux? Oh, the devil! That’s unpardonable in a man	270.69533088309026
of your age, and who besides, has such a pretty wife as yours.”	319.9054448111583
“Oh, Lord! no,” said Bonacieux, “but yesterday I went to St. Mandé to	183.16622919706168
make some inquiries after a servant, as I cannot possibly do without	348.02391133230185
one; and the roads were so bad that I brought back all this mud, which	206.95714382880317
I have not yet had time to remove.”	175.1466899594622
The place named by Bonacieux as that which had been the object of his	334.75807983450454
journey was a fresh proof in support of the suspicions D’Artagnan had	357.10052376723155
conceived. Bonacieux had named Mandé because Mandé was in an exactly	353.28348744146456
opposite direction from St. Cloud. This probability afforded him his	173.7690144780358
first consolation. If Bonacieux knew where his wife was, one might, by	232.39515593702492
extreme means, force the mercer to open his teeth and let his secret	316.67937460430335
escape. The question, then, was how to change this probability into a	175.63806526313948
certainty.	241.7716281328938
“Pardon, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux, if I don’t stand upon ceremony,”	285.53960980283637
said D’Artagnan, “but nothing makes one so thirsty as want of sleep. I	195.07113525320256
am parched with thirst. Allow me to take a glass of water in your	285.63387580438024
apartment; you know that is never refused among neighbors.”	270.3272800418828
Without waiting for the permission of his host, D’Artagnan went quickly	360.5787420142751
into the house, and cast a rapid glance at the bed. It had not been	321.4715772686794
used. Bonacieux had not been abed. He had only been back an hour or	245.81660680179186
two; he had accompanied his wife to the place of her confinement, or	238.97504086334595
else at least to the first relay.	188.3776881010921
“Thanks, Monsieur Bonacieux,” said D’Artagnan, emptying his glass,	199.09908272040937
“that is all I wanted of you. I will now go up into my apartment. I	353.59198347082736
will make Planchet brush my boots; and when he has done, I will, if you	314.9008875328722
like, send him to you to brush your shoes.”	264.1773756079125
He left the mercer quite astonished at his singular farewell, and	245.2187334198893
asking himself if he had not been a little inconsiderate.	251.99161838390728
At the top of the stairs he found Planchet in a great fright.	354.2610905999991
“Ah, monsieur!” cried Planchet, as soon as he perceived his master,	186.64782957571654
“here is more trouble. I thought you would never come in.”	345.8964590633039
“What’s the matter now, Planchet?” demanded D’Artagnan.	331.59538699838413
“Oh! I give you a hundred, I give you a thousand times to guess,	212.68271886904645
monsieur, the visit I received in your absence.”	263.5823367303387
“When?”	174.08149154272132
“About half an hour ago, while you were at Monsieur de Tréville’s.”	312.7419983044798
“Who has been here? Come, speak.”	171.07012606371265
“Monsieur de Cavois.”	183.9183715447639
“Monsieur de Cavois?”	191.87192868509655
“In person.”	346.9392999794801
“The captain of the cardinal’s Guards?”	255.82137469097484
“Himself.”	230.27448515228923
“Did he come to arrest me?”	349.8562764920163
“I have no doubt that he did, monsieur, for all his wheedling manner.”	329.976689685897
“Was he so sweet, then?”	307.60177267179506
“Indeed, he was all honey, monsieur.”	191.45724493316538
“Indeed!”	287.09341335404054
“He came, he said, on the part of his Eminence, who wished you well,	276.3732382428848
and to beg you to follow him to the Palais-Royal*.”	170.8016761364608
* It was called the Palais-Cardinal before Richelieu gave it to the	280.13591773525377
King.	175.1489083176947
“What did you answer him?”	236.78809899262728
“That the thing was impossible, seeing that you were not at home, as he	249.69995831930572
could see.”	310.5491589492586
“Well, what did he say then?”	333.425182997359
“That you must not fail to call upon him in the course of the day; and	332.9300140712836
then he added in a low voice, ‘Tell your master that his Eminence is	192.03344255851735
very well disposed toward him, and that his fortune perhaps depends	303.41720294779407
upon this interview.’”	315.53460557184405
“The snare is rather _maladroit_ for the cardinal,” replied the young	333.53773277749406
man, smiling.	307.7384793483925
“Oh, I saw the snare, and I answered you would be quite in despair on	317.97676561941273
your return.	226.12153092635094
“‘Where has he gone?’ asked Monsieur de Cavois.	201.3301168264206
“‘To Troyes, in Champagne,’ I answered.	257.2257948977725
“‘And when did he set out?’	233.25768774535584
“‘Yesterday evening.’”	218.52996315103275
“Planchet, my friend,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “you are really a	182.84464050325602
precious fellow.”	265.16892527093324
“You will understand, monsieur, I thought there would be still time, if	329.62036432994915
you wish, to see Monsieur de Cavois to contradict me by saying you were	357.393895786634
not yet gone. The falsehood would then lie at my door, and as I am not	170.2798309113827
a gentleman, I may be allowed to lie.”	170.04395243634093
“Be of good heart, Planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a	272.6831521416057
veracious man. In a quarter of an hour we set off.”	174.51073290956046
“That’s the advice I was about to give Monsieur; and where are we	253.48242782151252
going, may I ask, without being too curious?”	293.2740357608469
_“Pardieu!_ In the opposite direction to that which you said I was	316.6046869083458
gone. Besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of Grimaud,	343.76536682774264
Mousqueton, and Bazin as I am to know what has become of Athos,	170.92522289322915
Porthos, and Aramis?”	209.59498246758287
“Yes, monsieur,” said Planchet, “and I will go as soon as you please.	193.54398719310612
Indeed, I think provincial air will suit us much better just now than	258.2305849186033
the air of Paris. So then—”	242.06151086799755
“So then, pack up our luggage, Planchet, and let us be off. On my part,	222.4842723305375
I will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be	195.00932238436226
suspected. You may join me at the Hôtel des Gardes. By the way,	327.5151777741329
Planchet, I think you are right with respect to our host, and that he	316.98397884606936
is decidedly a frightfully low wretch.”	179.0118987119246
“Ah, monsieur, you may take my word when I tell you anything. I am a	321.00574767441924
physiognomist, I assure you.”	224.4590944414615
D’Artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. Then, in order that	340.62830582798506
he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,	358.0579355168267
for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news	221.4693801648902
had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an	324.15870520313103
elegant writing in small characters, had come for Aramis. D’Artagnan	345.7910175833367
took charge of it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the	294.66945027605124
stables of the Hôtel des Gardes. D’Artagnan, in order that there might	289.2152641605557
be no time lost, had saddled his horse himself.	174.36952199600572
“That’s well,” said he to Planchet, when the latter added the	321.24052328495327
portmanteau to the equipment. “Now saddle the other three horses.”	172.89474488923236
“Do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two	331.5558900917907
horses apiece?” said Planchet, with his shrewd air.	199.9332681058615
“No, Monsieur Jester,” replied D’Artagnan; “but with our four horses we	229.5439357011935
may bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to	257.5389716493318
find them living.”	348.30126656422175
“Which is a great chance,” replied Planchet, “but we must not despair	334.50212790404896
of the mercy of God.”	358.6561730220776
“Amen!” said D’Artagnan, getting into his saddle.	246.3876765037749
As they went from the Hôtel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the	339.802762670199
street at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barrière de la	208.8833788647571
Villette and the other by the Barrière Montmartre, to meet again beyond	220.25611820325418
St. Denis—a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal	207.5211925305586
punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D’Artagnan	168.87139745134044
and Planchet entered Pierrefitte together.	217.05860889557195
Planchet was more courageous, it must be admitted, by day than by	339.2959957665808
night. His natural prudence, however, never forsook him for a single	241.15122642553155
instant. He had forgotten not one of the incidents of the first	188.4811073954004
journey, and he looked upon everybody he met on the road as an enemy.	324.3937743740722
It followed that his hat was forever in his hand, which procured him	176.74267739576638
some severe reprimands from D’Artagnan, who feared that his excess of	316.35598191942984
politeness would lead people to think he was the lackey of a man of no	217.28013781716277
consequence.	319.8470696282354
Nevertheless, whether the passengers were really touched by the	236.0254851870328
urbanity of Planchet or whether this time nobody was posted on the	212.99426946586678
young man’s road, our two travelers arrived at Chantilly without any	338.1756945036037
accident, and alighted at the tavern of Great St. Martin, the same at	255.6887149264819
which they had stopped on their first journey.	328.33343172538025
The host, on seeing a young man followed by a lackey with two extra	339.4808669484913
horses, advanced respectfully to the door. Now, as they had already	359.20184799010764
traveled eleven leagues, D’Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether	285.7089169885743
Porthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to	196.91289728148277
ask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these	296.3341492903354
reflections was that D’Artagnan, without asking information of any	354.31662594448846
kind, alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered	220.18424453134074
a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and	343.7659793592851
desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a	175.64128577591285
breakfast as possible—a desire which further corroborated the high	200.5677581702059
opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight.	294.4605607081395
D’Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment	179.71113743972444
of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom;	319.7062230992315
and D’Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four	340.0286143083637
magnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not	177.07677980313198
fail to make a sensation. The host desired himself to serve him; which	297.7390246875797
D’Artagnan perceiving, ordered two glasses to be brought, and commenced	314.0866645018824
the following conversation.	178.43748444526557
“My faith, my good host,” said D’Artagnan, filling the two glasses, “I	168.7854149143146
asked for a bottle of your best wine, and if you have deceived me, you	365.70523348346524
will be punished in what you have sinned; for seeing that I hate	183.66052890143828
drinking by myself, you shall drink with me. Take your glass, then, and	350.8821008792005
let us drink. But what shall we drink to, so as to avoid wounding any	233.4389991520004
susceptibility? Let us drink to the prosperity of your establishment.”	323.0494724638812
“Your Lordship does me much honor,” said the host, “and I thank you	278.9223007198487
sincerely for your kind wish.”	364.876326212644
“But don’t mistake,” said D’Artagnan, “there is more selfishness in my	186.8867459264204
toast than perhaps you may think—for it is only in prosperous	194.16587058996495
establishments that one is well received. In hôtels that do not	223.0707962272707
flourish, everything is in confusion, and the traveler is a victim to	289.3814241697705
the embarrassments of his host. Now, I travel a great deal,	230.4110501572689
particularly on this road, and I wish to see all innkeepers making a	196.7697171458563
fortune.”	249.42932067082862
“It seems to me,” said the host, “that this is not the first time I	253.07848329939145
have had the honor of seeing Monsieur.”	189.5177986722686
“Bah, I have passed perhaps ten times through Chantilly, and out of the	301.28346607368496
ten times I have stopped three or four times at your house at least.	234.81118700540088
Why I was here only ten or twelve days ago. I was conducting some	336.45680662181445
friends, Musketeers, one of whom, by the by, had a dispute with a	292.26301018477034
stranger—a man who sought a quarrel with him, for I don’t know what.”	328.7388926748637
“Exactly so,” said the host; “I remember it perfectly. It is not	315.3126473322291
Monsieur Porthos that your Lordship means?”	228.67380938062934
“Yes, that is my companion’s name. My God, my dear host, tell me if	350.73662812782453
anything has happened to him?”	342.68762460784717
“Your Lordship must have observed that he could not continue his	291.04753004530454
journey.”	226.7425172036427
“Why, to be sure, he promised to rejoin us, and we have seen nothing of	285.2227346380606
him.”	270.85123573448243
“He has done us the honor to remain here.”	304.73462904421797
“What, he had done you the honor to remain here?”	355.70167660631716
“Yes, monsieur, in this house; and we are even a little uneasy—”	180.87282048007793
“On what account?”	331.70128559770444
“Of certain expenses he has contracted.”	221.85534498892966
“Well, but whatever expenses he may have incurred, I am sure he is in a	311.63683412391623
condition to pay them.”	254.84296496536263
“Ah, monsieur, you infuse genuine balm into my blood. We have made	178.15778648388053
considerable advances; and this very morning the surgeon declared that	354.6881601288229
if Monsieur Porthos did not pay him, he should look to me, as it was I	335.0150933971014
who had sent for him.”	238.86361081547557
“Porthos is wounded, then?”	243.83197742775525
“I cannot tell you, monsieur.”	189.97195816068356
“What! You cannot tell me? Surely you ought to be able to tell me	271.78162646207636
better than any other person.”	263.3388036798214
“Yes; but in our situation we must not say all we know—particularly as	179.0920818092869
we have been warned that our ears should answer for our tongues.”	320.12908065144654
“Well, can I see Porthos?”	359.17891542673254
“Certainly, monsieur. Take the stairs on your right; go up the first	340.1665165091754
flight and knock at Number One. Only warn him that it is you.”	304.7039047587182
“Why should I do that?”	327.69597403738305
“Because, monsieur, some mischief might happen to you.”	198.5143141617963
“Of what kind, in the name of wonder?”	286.1235609901869
“Monsieur Porthos may imagine you belong to the house, and in a fit of	226.61367633265917
passion might run his sword through you or blow out your brains.”	302.94535632686336
“What have you done to him, then?”	271.5187610494792
“We have asked him for money.”	231.835013019209
“The devil! Ah, I can understand that. It is a demand that Porthos	222.80791342937312
takes very ill when he is not in funds; but I know he must be so at	246.97606325078726
present.”	357.76417952799386
“We thought so, too, monsieur. As our house is carried on very	220.10025627728095
regularly, and we make out our bills every week, at the end of eight	229.80568295546763
days we presented our account; but it appeared we had chosen an unlucky	217.22214229479562
moment, for at the first word on the subject, he sent us to all the	308.1343369264274
devils. It is true he had been playing the day before.”	257.4765052519993
“Playing the day before! And with whom?”	327.8394966286329
“Lord, who can say, monsieur? With some gentleman who was traveling	195.79595563559275
this way, to whom he proposed a game of _lansquenet_.”	227.31149994714
“That’s it, then, and the foolish fellow lost all he had?”	269.9972161392845
“Even to his horse, monsieur; for when the gentleman was about to set	361.26922453996906
out, we perceived that his lackey was saddling Monsieur Porthos’s	329.82496082044366
horse, as well as his master’s. When we observed this to him, he told	176.49677791012675
us all to trouble ourselves about our own business, as this horse	318.5855008368874
belonged to him. We also informed Monsieur Porthos of what was going	226.92457245220268
on; but he told us we were scoundrels to doubt a gentleman’s word, and	307.7456378917712
that as he had said the horse was his, it must be so.”	265.76583724828856
“That’s Porthos all over,” murmured D’Artagnan.	196.07313942340437
“Then,” continued the host, “I replied that as from the moment we	344.86893797265236
seemed not likely to come to a good understanding with respect to	203.62150292296315
payment, I hoped that he would have at least the kindness to grant the	221.12118824035025
favor of his custom to my brother host of the Golden Eagle; but	290.6303164156866
Monsieur Porthos replied that, my house being the best, he should	303.134400234734
remain where he was. This reply was too flattering to allow me to	241.5147350673783
insist on his departure. I confined myself then to begging him to give	186.37393094319864
up his chamber, which is the handsomest in the hôtel, and to be	219.24368899400457
satisfied with a pretty little room on the third floor; but to this	173.5503758590134
Monsieur Porthos replied that as he every moment expected his mistress,	279.63667842873457
who was one of the greatest ladies in the court, I might easily	350.1432352934861
comprehend that the chamber he did me the honor to occupy in my house	330.8295670840613
was itself very mean for the visit of such a personage. Nevertheless,	210.2601161816895
while acknowledging the truth of what he said, I thought proper to	258.0104890797042
insist; but without even giving himself the trouble to enter into any	215.15244402637575
discussion with me, he took one of his pistols, laid it on his table,	301.7237007862062
day and night, and said that at the first word that should be spoken to	280.682089963999
him about removing, either within the house or out of it, he would blow	230.95680195801765
out the brains of the person who should be so imprudent as to meddle	227.7850943023668
with a matter which only concerned himself. Since that time, monsieur,	341.88701505907454
nobody entered his chamber but his servant.”	344.8604374456214
“What! Mousqueton is here, then?”	224.79325322559652
“Oh, yes, monsieur. Five days after your departure, he came back, and	322.50056842197864
in a very bad condition, too. It appears that he had met with	184.00420761341684
disagreeableness, likewise, on his journey. Unfortunately, he is more	194.15812587811394
nimble than his master; so that for the sake of his master, he puts us	244.64468531205762
all under his feet, and as he thinks we might refuse what he asked for,	304.08615211399194
he takes all he wants without asking at all.”	278.5376020890305
“The fact is,” said D’Artagnan, “I have always observed a great degree	265.4873540862869
of intelligence and devotedness in Mousqueton.”	349.5528180389963
“That is possible, monsieur; but suppose I should happen to be brought	171.9427793758599
in contact, even four times a year, with such intelligence and	240.44783227872364
devotedness—why, I should be a ruined man!”	361.5009960338689
“No, for Porthos will pay you.”	231.58999213815582
“Hum!” said the host, in a doubtful tone.	196.66327526491708
“The favorite of a great lady will not be allowed to be inconvenienced	363.13224718058916
for such a paltry sum as he owes you.”	215.31991798049407
“If I durst say what I believe on that head—”	288.87260769323126
“What you believe?”	231.2990297964699
“I ought rather to say, what I know.”	304.3351251406738
“What you know?”	362.88708573319616
“And even what I am sure of.”	322.3641225612757
“And of what are you so sure?”	184.98464295319323
“I would say that I know this great lady.”	351.2931889512567
“You?”	266.3348957248801
“Yes; I.”	325.70501396210335
“And how do you know her?”	278.1733224540907
“Oh, monsieur, if I could believe I might trust in your discretion.”	215.1368553942305
“Speak! By the word of a gentleman, you shall have no cause to repent	360.542557307431
of your confidence.”	344.0529380494272
“Well, monsieur, you understand that uneasiness makes us do many	330.9004237372356
things.”	343.8417403119071
“What have you done?”	194.10146478822722
“Oh, nothing which was not right in the character of a creditor.”	284.3741199731953
“Well?”	237.49237307017424
“Monsieur Porthos gave us a note for his duchess, ordering us to put it	167.74013589418323
in the post. This was before his servant came. As he could not leave	301.15071581998944
his chamber, it was necessary to charge us with this commission.”	175.14794870769586
“And then?”	309.42849564968856
“Instead of putting the letter in the post, which is never safe, I took	252.7000284937688
advantage of the journey of one of my lads to Paris, and ordered him to	200.9286307543682
convey the letter to this duchess himself. This was fulfilling the	180.9383896278377
intentions of Monsieur Porthos, who had desired us to be so careful of	184.97841597629005
this letter, was it not?”	292.2620039890388
“Nearly so.”	196.47777693547684
“Well, monsieur, do you know who this great lady is?”	335.0017594768608
“No; I have heard Porthos speak of her, that’s all.”	275.9322718349823
“Do you know who this pretended duchess is?	185.6325202500741
“I repeat to you, I don’t know her.”	310.9802888434966
“Why, she is the old wife of a procurator* of the Châtelet, monsieur,	301.1037757254103
named Madame Coquenard, who, although she is at least fifty, still	263.60492162207436
gives herself jealous airs. It struck me as very odd that a princess	293.82468509391134
should live in the Rue aux Ours.”	322.2244360693287
* Attorney	297.44348178259395
“But how do you know all this?”	262.4855672751875
“Because she flew into a great passion on receiving the letter, saying	341.65314959837883
that Monsieur Porthos was a weathercock, and that she was sure it was	170.30878506598097
for some woman he had received this wound.”	292.91806241278334
“Has he been wounded, then?”	256.42254058327325
“Oh, good Lord! What have I said?”	211.3608390060478
“You said that Porthos had received a sword cut.”	298.9240556281237
“Yes, but he has forbidden me so strictly to say so.”	356.3793655885594
“And why so.”	360.2481416263775
“Zounds, monsieur! Because he had boasted that he would perforate the	231.92002392577064
stranger with whom you left him in dispute; whereas the stranger, on	199.96202400878002
the contrary, in spite of all his rodomontades quickly threw him on his	206.46389717115056
back. As Monsieur Porthos is a very boastful man, he insists that	216.13075885684978
nobody shall know he has received this wound except the duchess, whom	269.099182687568
he endeavored to interest by an account of his adventure.”	166.85973177093246
“It is a wound that confines him to his bed?”	365.03868877778564
“Ah, and a master stroke, too, I assure you. Your friend’s soul must	169.26407472337877
stick tight to his body.”	248.61169489306587
“Were you there, then?”	223.91117808433023
“Monsieur, I followed them from curiosity, so that I saw the combat	302.2794445492651
without the combatants seeing me.”	361.4099243894012
“And what took place?”	214.1858480673976
“Oh! The affair was not long, I assure you. They placed themselves on	286.37815629832187
guard; the stranger made a feint and a lunge, and that so rapidly that	299.3969209999184
when Monsieur Porthos came to the _parade_, he had already three inches	297.53213149101293
of steel in his breast. He immediately fell backward. The stranger	239.70618881367267
placed the point of his sword at his throat; and Monsieur Porthos,	306.7693879585455
finding himself at the mercy of his adversary, acknowledged himself	224.46470169545938
conquered. Upon which the stranger asked his name, and learning that it	361.20299868317005
was Porthos, and not D’Artagnan, he assisted him to rise, brought him	305.26338080578705
back to the hôtel, mounted his horse, and disappeared.”	247.7060054295247
“So it was with Monsieur d’Artagnan this stranger meant to quarrel?”	303.48897573503507
“It appears so.”	287.11131180996847
“And do you know what has become of him?”	314.2289985914556
“No, I never saw him until that moment, and have not seen him since.”	352.24980864550344
“Very well; I know all that I wish to know. Porthos’s chamber is, you	289.99528917585144
say, on the first story, Number One?”	296.8504023403216
“Yes, monsieur, the handsomest in the inn—a chamber that I could have	248.57461976253163
let ten times over.”	279.5341501421758
“Bah! Be satisfied,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “Porthos will pay you	253.72096151088977
with the money of the Duchess Coquenard.”	262.8692958546617
“Oh, monsieur, procurator’s wife or duchess, if she will but loosen her	325.52613757633287
pursestrings, it will be all the same; but she positively answered that	357.72690249855094
she was tired of the exigencies and infidelities of Monsieur Porthos,	327.1503888910081
and that she would not send him a denier.”	200.15438646334536
“And did you convey this answer to your guest?”	243.4116428349855
“We took good care not to do that; he would have found in what fashion	185.20122612519881
we had executed his commission.”	172.73353507917867
“So that he still expects his money?”	185.77066366972323
“Oh, Lord, yes, monsieur! Yesterday he wrote again; but it was his	286.13653486197535
servant who this time put the letter in the post.”	306.52072235160927
“Do you say the procurator’s wife is old and ugly?”	208.8841967866079
“Fifty at least, monsieur, and not at all handsome, according to	275.3004108396364
Pathaud’s account.”	240.9455312307901
“In that case, you may be quite at ease; she will soon be softened.	292.2201994299591
Besides, Porthos cannot owe you much.”	230.1917034382583
“How, not much! Twenty good pistoles, already, without reckoning the	335.47080170891127
doctor. He denies himself nothing; it may easily be seen he has been	200.23384369327982
accustomed to live well.”	362.9365284146621
“Never mind; if his mistress abandons him, he will find friends, I will	330.73690742177683
answer for it. So, my dear host, be not uneasy, and continue to take	171.29827522880652
all the care of him that his situation requires.”	213.42932773508562
“Monsieur has promised me not to open his mouth about the procurator’s	184.8547782181772
wife, and not to say a word of the wound?”	351.3196030504015
“That’s agreed; you have my word.”	179.17432576309946
“Oh, he would kill me!”	362.42583190291316
“Don’t be afraid; he is not so much of a devil as he appears.”	242.83084305478135
Saying these words, D’Artagnan went upstairs, leaving his host a little	307.6368920654351
better satisfied with respect to two things in which he appeared to be	275.4070516533726
very much interested—his debt and his life.	200.95881544815913
At the top of the stairs, upon the most conspicuous door of the	166.67044490133762
corridor, was traced in black ink a gigantic number “1.” D’Artagnan	191.2687775561697
knocked, and upon the bidding to come in which came from inside, he	168.73558579242928
entered the chamber.	267.16090177998956
Porthos was in bed, and was playing a game at _lansquenet_ with	282.33172756439524
Mousqueton, to keep his hand in; while a spit loaded with partridges	244.4447946774512
was turning before the fire, and on each side of a large chimneypiece,	232.89877886068103
over two chafing dishes, were boiling two stewpans, from which exhaled	210.301159064081
a double odor of rabbit and fish stews, rejoicing to the smell. In	255.97242692778977
addition to this he perceived that the top of a wardrobe and the marble	272.81213511373693
of a commode were covered with empty bottles.	238.8906569854422
At the sight of his friend, Porthos uttered a loud cry of joy; and	213.20739225911842
Mousqueton, rising respectfully, yielded his place to him, and went to	233.33050266362443
give an eye to the two stewpans, of which he appeared to have the	184.30511524715848
particular inspection.	351.9142581381059
“Ah, _pardieu!_ Is that you?” said Porthos to D’Artagnan. “You are	239.41605672669556
right welcome. Excuse my not coming to meet you; but,” added he,	255.13545498886458
looking at D’Artagnan with a certain degree of uneasiness, “you know	284.93391493872286
what has happened to me?”	306.46147830406824
“No.”	267.3513464755633
“Has the host told you nothing, then?”	283.2212383904971
“I asked after you, and came up as soon as I could.”	280.1132819505752
Porthos seemed to breathe more freely.	199.50724465757196
“And what has happened to you, my dear Porthos?” continued D’Artagnan.	270.61407629342546
“Why, on making a thrust at my adversary, whom I had already hit three	230.52467517356524
times, and whom I meant to finish with the fourth, I put my foot on a	318.00299668958155
stone, slipped, and strained my knee.”	248.85868130544787
“Truly?”	200.18732726652507
“Honor! Luckily for the rascal, for I should have left him dead on the	281.8133813179037
spot, I assure you.”	183.92491889500633
“And what has became of him?”	350.14370678009936
“Oh, I don’t know; he had enough, and set off without waiting for the	220.3445325599792
rest. But you, my dear D’Artagnan, what has happened to you?”	328.6814227869808
“So that this strain of the knee,” continued D’Artagnan, “my dear	310.56269678717797
Porthos, keeps you in bed?”	286.04421676225616
“My God, that’s all. I shall be about again in a few days.”	244.83316186676092
“Why did you not have yourself conveyed to Paris? You must be cruelly	198.0594019939283
bored here.”	170.6020585133719
“That was my intention; but, my dear friend, I have one thing to	350.6760572811213
confess to you.”	280.99057057972016
“What’s that?”	343.11632402291156
“It is that as I was cruelly bored, as you say, and as I had the	343.04202842337713
seventy-five pistoles in my pocket which you had distributed to me, in	341.37117012786695
order to amuse myself I invited a gentleman who was traveling this way	284.7931954195752
to walk up, and proposed a cast of dice. He accepted my challenge, and,	220.8272956407091
my faith, my seventy-five pistoles passed from my pocket to his,	234.15666209678136
without reckoning my horse, which he won into the bargain. But you, my	196.37107035404296
dear D’Artagnan?”	166.97609094912318
“What can you expect, my dear Porthos; a man is not privileged in all	240.42846058123797
ways,” said D’Artagnan. “You know the proverb ‘Unlucky at play, lucky	345.80050441188826
in love.’ You are too fortunate in your love for play not to take its	234.30439358187323
revenge. What consequence can the reverses of fortune be to you? Have	267.405263897213
you not, happy rogue that you are—have you not your duchess, who cannot	239.72428473597853
fail to come to your aid?”	259.2046824214421
“Well, you see, my dear D’Artagnan, with what ill luck I play,” replied	320.6551821825624
Porthos, with the most careless air in the world. “I wrote to her to	243.53890521234385
send me fifty louis or so, of which I stood absolutely in need on	314.7431127623446
account of my accident.”	263.8614724596161
“Well?”	179.27468348275994
“Well, she must be at her country seat, for she has not answered me.”	270.6564617506108
“Truly?”	191.19612558932297
“No; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more	294.1472966977413
pressing than the first. But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak	250.50324487139136
of you. I confess I began to be very uneasy on your account.”	203.25845490814936
“But your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear	241.6486381669583
Porthos,” said D’Artagnan, directing the sick man’s attention to the	317.16696415872264
full stewpans and the empty bottles.	186.8759986258843
“So, so,” replied Porthos. “Only three or four days ago the impertinent	187.3518161019437
jackanapes gave me his bill, and I was forced to turn both him and his	198.8167300721707
bill out of the door; so that I am here something in the fashion of a	325.5466179929728
conqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. So you see,	253.76986401608383
being in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed	244.48098278642726
to the teeth.”	329.59585163770055
“And yet,” said D’Artagnan, laughing, “it appears to me that from time	213.52217218443883
to time you must make _sorties_.” And he again pointed to the bottles	184.90256428341655
and the stewpans.	282.8099478521339
“Not I, unfortunately!” said Porthos. “This miserable strain confines	225.4791799602705
me to my bed; but Mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. Friend	306.18932861038013
Mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an	303.63388878965765
increase of supplies.”	304.43007614201684
“Mousqueton,” said D’Artagnan, “you must render me a service.”	226.42484787316525
“What, monsieur?”	286.4596830117297
“You must give your recipe to Planchet. I may be besieged in my turn,	331.9539600392653
and I shall not be sorry for him to be able to let me enjoy the same	354.65180969562005
advantages with which you gratify your master.”	335.919677395163
“Lord, monsieur! There is nothing more easy,” said Mousqueton, with a	213.7135677464153
modest air. “One only needs to be sharp, that’s all. I was brought up	195.47734149181946
in the country, and my father in his leisure time was something of a	249.82997406980178
poacher.”	180.2001914265549
“And what did he do the rest of his time?”	341.0529453789162
“Monsieur, he carried on a trade which I have always thought	200.27122148062338
satisfactory.”	266.2997445422069
“Which?”	298.7507805807837
“As it was a time of war between the Catholics and the Huguenots, and	344.24813768166547
as he saw the Catholics exterminate the Huguenots and the Huguenots	276.3282298368346
exterminate the Catholics—all in the name of religion—he adopted a	303.11138721797386
mixed belief which permitted him to be sometimes Catholic, sometimes a	315.2097990657239
Huguenot. Now, he was accustomed to walk with his fowling piece on his	310.8469860424923
shoulder, behind the hedges which border the roads, and when he saw a	243.09281612929396
Catholic coming alone, the Protestant religion immediately prevailed in	302.2134832955729
his mind. He lowered his gun in the direction of the traveler; then,	231.1626885439434
when he was within ten paces of him, he commenced a conversation which	202.97230972808632
almost always ended by the traveler’s abandoning his purse to save his	330.773471827949
life. It goes without saying that when he saw a Huguenot coming, he	217.43987923083483
felt himself filled with such ardent Catholic zeal that he could not	201.01776627834846
understand how, a quarter of an hour before, he had been able to have	359.2684507842801
any doubts upon the superiority of our holy religion. For my part,	276.68396605836074
monsieur, I am Catholic—my father, faithful to his principles, having	267.46033070807863
made my elder brother a Huguenot.”	225.08234044234496
“And what was the end of this worthy man?” asked D’Artagnan.	197.31817267653855
“Oh, of the most unfortunate kind, monsieur. One day he was surprised	276.6331283841523
in a lonely road between a Huguenot and a Catholic, with both of whom	344.2716469055667
he had before had business, and who both knew him again; so they united	196.5024414969357
against him and hanged him on a tree. Then they came and boasted of	298.6777302627333
their fine exploit in the cabaret of the next village, where my brother	339.568993046091
and I were drinking.”	224.5408767110765
“And what did you do?” said D’Artagnan.	194.53431630660867
“We let them tell their story out,” replied Mousqueton. “Then, as in	232.0645392179365
leaving the cabaret they took different directions, my brother went and	299.43520726607164
hid himself on the road of the Catholic, and I on that of the Huguenot.	269.9890479745408
Two hours after, all was over; we had done the business of both,	284.05130189324746
admiring the foresight of our poor father, who had taken the precaution	203.73533796609783
to bring each of us up in a different religion.”	346.8178168334499
“Well, I must allow, as you say, your father was a very intelligent	343.82367157159786
fellow. And you say in his leisure moments the worthy man was a	282.9476058319426
poacher?”	336.5422803099401
“Yes, monsieur, and it was he who taught me to lay a snare and ground a	346.08575721105973
line. The consequence is that when I saw our laborers, which did not at	247.96614924496225
all suit two such delicate stomachs as ours, I had recourse to a little	250.54091109866977
of my old trade. While walking near the wood of Monsieur le Prince, I	229.50590004833958
laid a few snares in the runs; and while reclining on the banks of his	330.6142832736133
Highness’s pieces of water, I slipped a few lines into his fish ponds.	337.4347982026801
So that now, thanks be to God, we do not want, as Monsieur can testify,	355.6413736404686
for partridges, rabbits, carp or eels—all light, wholesome food,	331.69277005481933
suitable for the sick.”	231.32196250204828
“But the wine,” said D’Artagnan, “who furnishes the wine? Your host?”	257.03316791206294
“That is to say, yes and no.”	266.6984600947588
“How yes and no?”	209.62008775248933
“He furnishes it, it is true, but he does not know that he has that	257.9517331764457
honor.”	207.6313383043209
“Explain yourself, Mousqueton; your conversation is full of instructive	257.58066594211226
things.”	320.57875179951407
“That is it, monsieur. It has so chanced that I met with a Spaniard in	190.75571169293923
my peregrinations who had seen many countries, and among them the New	181.6303226302084
World.”	187.26863820781807
“What connection can the New World have with the bottles which are on	301.99493224177263
the commode and the wardrobe?”	332.498076431252
“Patience, monsieur, everything will come in its turn.”	264.33925408481747
“This Spaniard had in his service a lackey who had accompanied him in	250.21062090321044
his voyage to Mexico. This lackey was my compatriot; and we became the	341.6234546772872
more intimate from there being many resemblances of character between	363.15457481253003
us. We loved sporting of all kinds better than anything; so that he	275.2170938250901
related to me how in the plains of the Pampas the natives hunt the	331.4177300157954
tiger and the wild bull with simple running nooses which they throw to	259.46951987353384
a distance of twenty or thirty paces the end of a cord with such	321.24137707265265
nicety; but in face of the proof I was obliged to acknowledge the truth	201.89872098247616
of the recital. My friend placed a bottle at the distance of thirty	350.0005442964608
paces, and at each cast he caught the neck of the bottle in his running	309.18494339146844
noose. I practiced this exercise, and as nature has endowed me with	253.8596670865604
some faculties, at this day I can throw the lasso with any man in the	322.7116727933963
world. Well, do you understand, monsieur? Our host has a well-furnished	297.46404828477614
cellar the key of which never leaves him; only this cellar has a	208.89174328397436
ventilating hole. Now through this ventilating hole I throw my lasso,	228.35336508461722
and as I now know in which part of the cellar is the best wine, that’s	187.43767377055767
my point for sport. You see, monsieur, what the New World has to do	173.43579810000517
with the bottles which are on the commode and the wardrobe. Now, will	179.4005418639025
you taste our wine, and without prejudice say what you think of it?”	288.0726295082946
“Thank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, I have just	182.53244625337834
breakfasted.”	286.78913356101236
“Well,” said Porthos, “arrange the table, Mousqueton, and while we	362.94576577820857
breakfast, D’Artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during	268.588990360577
the ten days since he left us.”	277.6688164563135
“Willingly,” said D’Artagnan.	257.22899934038526
While Porthos and Mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of	291.6823307754754
convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in	312.770014541865
misfortune, D’Artagnan related how Aramis, being wounded, was obliged	307.6911386790465
to stop at Crèvecœur, how he had left Athos fighting at Amiens with	212.92945663992822
four men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, D’Artagnan, had	326.25502461351925
been forced to run the Comtes de Wardes through the body in order to	287.908770483987
reach England.	220.64555215791546
But there the confidence of D’Artagnan stopped. He only added that on	234.08869410666313
his return from Great Britain he had brought back four magnificent	170.38243483591515
horses—one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he	223.80876125372956
informed Porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in	308.58850897554123
the stable of the tavern.	343.58060061095415
At this moment Planchet entered, to inform his master that the horses	218.65125422440636
were sufficiently refreshed and that it would be possible to sleep at	340.2902654930433
Clermont.	225.25650808208061
As D’Artagnan was tolerably reassured with regard to Porthos, and as he	272.00699760513317
was anxious to obtain news of his two other friends, he held out his	280.8532993046166
hand to the wounded man, and told him he was about to resume his route	191.54333613171428
in order to continue his researches. For the rest, as he reckoned upon	181.6580951587782
returning by the same route in seven or eight days, if Porthos were	216.19840447904824
still at the Great St. Martin, he would call for him on his way.	350.13930826902265
Porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him	280.0861596658831
to depart yet awhile. Besides, it was necessary he should stay at	363.1620209843546
Chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.	359.0824897851604
D’Artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having	199.62086414298676
again recommended Porthos to the care of Mousqueton, and paid his bill	269.6167079229459
to the host, he resumed his route with Planchet, already relieved of	342.95292471871335
one of his led horses.	291.93935303089694
Chapter XXVI.	333.9153983371146
ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS	194.2193361297839
D’Artagnan had said nothing to Porthos of his wound or of his	333.069504906775
procurator’s wife. Our Béarnais was a prudent lad, however young he	176.57302201458242
might be. Consequently he had appeared to believe all that the	167.29930209352048
vainglorious Musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will	262.6020444484483
hold out against a surprised secret. Besides, we feel always a sort of	242.14958803605333
mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they	329.0656830489529
suppose. In his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as	207.74928638208343
he was to make his three friends the instruments of his fortune,	237.14617590131638
D’Artagnan was not sorry at getting into his grasp beforehand the	216.76161050507574
invisible strings by which he reckoned upon moving them.	293.79051876185594
And yet, as he journeyed along, a profound sadness weighed upon his	248.41206749508652
heart. He thought of that young and pretty Mme. Bonacieux who was to	311.4688271658373
have paid him the price of his devotedness; but let us hasten to say	177.07443342905623
that this sadness possessed the young man less from the regret of the	303.538173131579
happiness he had missed, than from the fear he entertained that some	245.64166713570359
serious misfortune had befallen the poor woman. For himself, he had no	216.88257948726834
doubt she was a victim of the cardinal’s vengeance; and, as was well	266.3715656003925
known, the vengeance of his Eminence was terrible. How he had found	339.56549581562166
grace in the eyes of the minister, he did not know; but without doubt	314.53754245599555
M. de Cavois would have revealed this to him if the captain of the	340.37913332925956
Guards had found him at home.	330.64840124721155
Nothing makes time pass more quickly or more shortens a journey than a	296.55093353674306
thought which absorbs in itself all the faculties of the organization	363.57224475666044
of him who thinks. External existence then resembles a sleep of which	220.9955335942973
this thought is the dream. By its influence, time has no longer	187.7316570794194
measure, space has no longer distance. We depart from one place, and	298.2552554767999
arrive at another, that is all. Of the interval passed, nothing remains	273.1552612629311
in the memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of	314.16905085681196
trees, mountains, and landscapes are lost. It was as a prey to this	252.16736609857767
hallucination that D’Artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse	336.3150405789451
pleased, the six or eight leagues that separated Chantilly from	355.6871035159703
Crèvecœur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the	318.7864200910425
village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.	286.62045327258704
There only his memory returned to him. He shook his head, perceived the	257.46603512352686
cabaret at which he had left Aramis, and putting his horse to the trot,	292.20096411180145
he shortly pulled up at the door.	236.35412917869132
This time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. D’Artagnan	170.65064483780085
was a physiognomist. His eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful	284.7015062283357
countenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived	205.42453759276165
there was no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything	167.79500838652837
from one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy.	194.43097667962357
“My good dame,” asked D’Artagnan, “can you tell me what has become of	247.1070458044851
one of my friends, whom we were obliged to leave here about a dozen	222.17657763155614
days ago?”	320.2882775245464
“A handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild,	309.1004920938334
amiable, and well made?”	191.0736988580603
“That is he—wounded in the shoulder.”	284.0226692839169
“Just so. Well, monsieur, he is still here.”	251.48842842891213
“Ah, _pardieu!_ My dear dame,” said D’Artagnan, springing from his	234.25206730933368
horse, and throwing the bridle to Planchet, “you restore me to life;	328.66145873310086
where is this dear Aramis? Let me embrace him, I am in a hurry to see	310.21563950703626
him again.”	239.70895899177174
“Pardon, monsieur, but I doubt whether he can see you at this moment.”	307.65076749284833
“Why so? Has he a lady with him?”	272.2169277104932
“Jesus! What do you mean by that? Poor lad! No, monsieur, he has not a	317.9789083934228
lady with him.”	204.2513519715842
“With whom is he, then?”	231.64682830713963
“With the curate of Montdidier and the superior of the Jesuits of	321.6428472517929
Amiens.”	243.80166340951902
“Good heavens!” cried D’Artagnan, “is the poor fellow worse, then?”	255.131648971403
“No, monsieur, quite the contrary; but after his illness grace touched	220.399740141523
him, and he determined to take orders.”	355.0915320918915
“That’s it!” said D’Artagnan, “I had forgotten that he was only a	335.83704954546283
Musketeer for a time.”	306.4881807634619
“Monsieur still insists upon seeing him?”	235.355285354995
“More than ever.”	236.0751918318769
“Well, monsieur has only to take the right-hand staircase in the	196.75090913597444
courtyard, and knock at Number Five on the second floor.”	265.8996273626574
D’Artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated, and found one of	261.18093475659145
those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our	279.25716484926954
old-fashioned taverns. But there was no getting at the place of sojourn	354.29313176871597
of the future abbé; the defiles of the chamber of Aramis were as well	197.49335230671448
guarded as the gardens of Armida. Bazin was stationed in the corridor,	340.19589117508553
and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years	251.04713352639462
of trial, Bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been	351.1096606799915
ambitious.	246.13369933165376
In fact, the dream of poor Bazin had always been to serve a churchman;	190.461281370705
and he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when	341.08013000595383
Aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. The	286.598711199302
daily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment would not long	256.3638236393889
be delayed, had alone kept him in the service of a Musketeer—a service	298.32302847973915
in which, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy.	281.2819147203693
Bazin was then at the height of joy. In all probability, this time his	323.16782729959374
master would not retract. The union of physical pain with moral	269.4198471707723
uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. Aramis, suffering	364.50899527439014
at once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts	254.53389720984035
upon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the	297.6286640197747
double accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden	184.92180018279672
disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder.	334.3910406722412
It may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his	264.36917547596994
master nothing could be more disagreeable to Bazin than the arrival of	195.92610117426045
D’Artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of	181.1029595391799
mundane affairs which had so long carried him away. He resolved, then,	199.88659541795533
to defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the	321.63145252195477
inn, he could not say that Aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to	306.3971165805433
the newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his	363.928875760139
master in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning	178.50936473149113
and would not, as Bazin said, terminate before night.	202.07355972296696
But D’Artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of M.	273.5637111792186
Bazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his	180.08032950800316
friend’s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and	305.1312745718841
with the other turned the handle of the door of Number Five. The door	258.3730672985983
opened, and D’Artagnan went into the chamber.	330.78974137520885
Aramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat	346.91094959420775
cap, not much unlike a _calotte_, was seated before an oblong table,	178.62509377062952
covered with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. At his right	280.81476962642637
hand was placed the superior of the Jesuits, and on his left the curate	257.17149816092336
of Montdidier. The curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the	244.40925090369078
mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. All the mundane	199.35822302083133
objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young	341.97581937275686
man, particularly when that young man is a Musketeer, had disappeared	287.44225116008937
as if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them	180.55910163553736
might bring his master back to ideas of this world, Bazin had laid his	195.89616837875514
hands upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of	307.3121539576996
all kinds and sorts. In their stead D’Artagnan thought he perceived in	360.1983199010465
an obscure corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.	307.9114928122633
At the noise made by D’Artagnan in entering, Aramis lifted up his head,	200.34921216009047
and beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man,	169.17777051193698
the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the Musketeer, so	307.7995657925481
completely was his mind detached from the things of this world.	313.1121179239887
“Good day, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis; “believe me, I am glad to see	322.08110030406124
you.”	205.3042912309111
“So am I delighted to see you,” said D’Artagnan, “although I am not yet	347.9197949586609
sure that it is Aramis I am speaking to.”	323.8402034978939
“To himself, my friend, to himself! But what makes you doubt it?”	172.72778716726162
“I was afraid I had made a mistake in the chamber, and that I had found	358.01175776551463
my way into the apartment of some churchman. Then another error seized	337.84455494508575
me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen—I was afraid you were	167.74389640915012
dangerously ill.”	208.45872096117247
The two men in black, who guessed D’Artagnan’s meaning, darted at him a	175.86716767713352
glance which might have been thought threatening; but D’Artagnan took	325.698910761415
no heed of it.	217.8737553653561
“I disturb you, perhaps, my dear Aramis,” continued D’Artagnan, “for by	226.28422004626552
what I see, I am led to believe that you are confessing to these	286.54361060812494
gentlemen.”	312.5247963278846
Aramis colored imperceptibly. “You disturb me? Oh, quite the contrary,	194.25441028202943
dear friend, I swear; and as a proof of what I say, permit me to	192.64239961524112
declare I am rejoiced to see you safe and sound.”	346.31829318204143
“Ah, he’ll come round,” thought D’Artagnan; “that’s not bad!”	308.5831496236471
“This gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious	363.9798696977861
danger,” continued Aramis, with unction, pointing to D’Artagnan with	310.61951275448905
his hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.	365.34030642447823
“Praise God, monsieur,” replied they, bowing together.	243.6290126942698
“I have not failed to do so, your Reverences,” replied the young man,	327.3635250617159
returning their salutation.	351.4714447615865
“You arrive in good time, dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, “and by taking	319.020642621471
part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence. Monsieur	168.99248263132642
the Principal of Amiens, Monsieur the Curate of Montdidier, and I are	306.78912925700433
arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much	296.0980704393194
interested; I shall be delighted to have your opinion.”	223.6695067556826
“The opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight,” replied	319.94248023892146
D’Artagnan, who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking, “and	245.46875627935282
you had better be satisfied, believe me, with the knowledge of these	217.395455577456
gentlemen.”	196.40168610442416
The two men in black bowed in their turn.	245.1013575201144
“On the contrary,” replied Aramis, “your opinion will be very valuable.	361.0737337310098
The question is this: Monsieur the Principal thinks that my thesis	299.5333467367857
ought to be dogmatic and didactic.”	172.5071131089438
“Your thesis! Are you then making a thesis?”	349.9655585971284
“Without doubt,” replied the Jesuit. “In the examination which precedes	207.54065832925568
ordination, a thesis is always a requisite.”	197.87961744898138
“Ordination!” cried D’Artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess	261.39986814699046
and Bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon	312.2940652327493
the three persons before him.	358.18112204065073
“Now,” continued Aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy	267.36223167750427
chair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his	172.4334868390297
hand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he	333.556424552352
held in the air to cause the blood to descend, “now, as you have heard,	323.4970600651128
D’Artagnan, Monsieur the Principal is desirous that my thesis should be	349.85940511818967
dogmatic, while I, for my part, would rather it should be ideal. This	234.75163359987363
is the reason why Monsieur the Principal has proposed to me the	172.55006031361108
following subject, which has not yet been treated upon, and in which I	342.5860120487168
perceive there is matter for magnificent elaboration—‘_Utraque manus in	332.48594200452186
benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est_.’”	275.73701636740566
D’Artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no	311.59586171809775
more interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of M. de	362.82070407184983
Tréville in allusion to the gifts he pretended that D’Artagnan had	282.3039970553096
received from the Duke of Buckingham.	193.5980391758841
“Which means,” resumed Aramis, that he might perfectly understand,	188.09974479887342
“‘The two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders,	326.64672944661226
when they bestow the benediction.’”	223.2332477742579
“An admirable subject!” cried the Jesuit.	314.8823074793637
“Admirable and dogmatic!” repeated the curate, who, about as strong as	214.71388708718538
D’Artagnan with respect to Latin, carefully watched the Jesuit in order	202.77507471375807
to keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo.	293.7351532457874
As to D’Artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of	195.2653354727078
the two men in black.	287.5474683933413
“Yes, admirable! _prorsus admirabile!_” continued Aramis; “but which	305.4807451494682
requires a profound study of both the Scriptures and the Fathers. Now,	268.4565701199669
I have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all	277.96431619179197
humility, that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king	168.24755029244946
have caused me to neglect study a little. I should find myself,	210.86050948195287
therefore, more at my ease, _facilius natans_, in a subject of my own	319.04056456357876
choice, which would be to these hard theological questions what morals	293.4602782455701
are to metaphysics in philosophy.”	239.46581215755197
D’Artagnan began to be tired, and so did the curate.	263.49132109493576
“See what an exordium!” cried the Jesuit.	281.6817742623652
“Exordium,” repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.	330.67362712298035
“_Quemadmodum inter cœlorum immensitatem_.”	307.2368274917772
Aramis cast a glance upon D’Artagnan to see what effect all this	234.94941672230254
produced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.	363.1061552398282
“Let us speak French, my father,” said he to the Jesuit; “Monsieur	324.7128614214976
d’Artagnan will enjoy our conversation better.”	352.6937985752244
“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan; “I am fatigued with reading, and all this	330.54051929111404
Latin confuses me.”	260.2160591774249
“Certainly,” replied the Jesuit, a little put out, while the curate,	295.54921793348126
greatly delighted, turned upon D’Artagnan a look full of gratitude.	341.74468077899445
“Well, let us see what is to be derived from this gloss. Moses, the	289.52722094186333
servant of God—he was but a servant, please to understand—Moses blessed	312.4097353825061
with the hands; he held out both his arms while the Hebrews beat their	182.31533680051203
enemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands. Besides, what	317.09953065075075
does the Gospel say? _Imponite manus_, and not _manum_—place the	177.29677794837696
_hands_, not the _hand_.”	245.81218259566825
“Place the _hands_,” repeated the curate, with a gesture.	303.5555303582412
“St. Peter, on the contrary, of whom the Popes are the successors,”	254.2053804323045
continued the Jesuit; “_porrige digitos_—present the fingers. Are you	173.97733207413
there, now?”	350.69656797145507
“_Certes_,” replied Aramis, in a pleased tone, “but the thing is	323.29301200337585
subtle.”	172.09031253335883
“The _fingers_,” resumed the Jesuit, “St. Peter blessed with the	240.41895999513173
_fingers_. The Pope, therefore blesses with the fingers. And with how	283.7963581545974
many fingers does he bless? With _three_ fingers, to be sure—one for	210.391846023948
the Father, one for the Son, and one for the Holy Ghost.”	293.94100604101277
All crossed themselves. D’Artagnan thought it was proper to follow this	344.1339654867767
example.	274.18410828373186
“The Pope is the successor of St. Peter, and represents the three	190.80625989134333
divine powers; the rest—_ordines inferiores_—of the ecclesiastical	318.6109157461883
hierarchy bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. The most	359.45466327937265
humble clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water	198.72302834653777
sprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers.	327.92279765758553
There is the subject simplified. _Argumentum omni denudatum ornamento_.	281.84240724754875
I could make of that subject two volumes the size of this,” continued	202.15596829334623
the Jesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a St. Chrysostom in folio,	247.58902125152275
which made the table bend beneath its weight.	262.3302819107573
D’Artagnan trembled.	190.35822299360385
“_Certes_,” said Aramis, “I do justice to the beauties of this thesis;	178.90993593425452
but at the same time I perceive it would be overwhelming for me. I had	306.6176634157616
chosen this text—tell me, dear D’Artagnan, if it is not to your	189.46880007139856
taste—‘_Non inutile est desiderium in oblatione_’; that is, ‘A little	174.35103398854028
regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the Lord.’”	196.7140406555962
“Stop there!” cried the Jesuit, “for that thesis touches closely upon	298.4697863187612
heresy. There is a proposition almost like it in the _Augustinus_ of	225.67842214000734
the heresiarch Jansenius, whose book will sooner or later be burned by	321.28852287339953
the hands of the executioner. Take care, my young friend. You are	236.8663975173107
inclining toward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost.”	276.2941797285481
“You will be lost,” said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully.	247.67722728626654
“You approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock.	316.85140249283694
You face the insinuations of the Pelagians and the semi-Pelagians.”	299.3168122304414
“But, my Reverend—” replied Aramis, a little amazed by the shower of	234.2762929740847
arguments that poured upon his head.	275.97935173541407
“How will you prove,” continued the Jesuit, without allowing him time	314.6366480176986
to speak, “that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to	248.29617796889252
God? Listen to this dilemma: God is God, and the world is the devil. To	177.82476231327914
regret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion.”	192.58093351895675
“And that is mine also,” said the curate.	308.4621986983931
“But, for heaven’s sake—” resumed Aramis.	363.7967614000625
“_Desideras diabolum_, unhappy man!” cried the Jesuit.	239.63592219118206
“He regrets the devil! Ah, my young friend,” added the curate,	352.44026550055366
groaning, “do not regret the devil, I implore you!”	278.6328117316625
D’Artagnan felt himself bewildered. It seemed to him as though he were	298.06135231278427
in a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw. He was,	180.99309551963853
however, forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the	279.8016981146319
language they employed.	302.3210270241808
“But listen to me, then,” resumed Aramis with politeness mingled with a	239.91353452450858
little impatience. “I do not say I regret; no, I will never pronounce	195.15577534907192
that sentence, which would not be orthodox.”	174.4794739556833
The Jesuit raised his hands toward heaven, and the curate did the same.	235.2233000371612
“No; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to	250.3495634865546
the Lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted! Don’t you	308.0056688642553
think so, D’Artagnan?”	310.13236974823894
“I think so, indeed,” cried he.	259.5157422656964
The Jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs.	215.60109879361082
“This is the point of departure; it is a syllogism. The world is not	252.2382699092721
wanting in attractions. I quit the world; then I make a sacrifice. Now,	320.5233634022933
the Scripture says positively, ‘Make a sacrifice unto the Lord.’”	206.1750487455626
“That is true,” said his antagonists.	203.1873286179466
“And then,” said Aramis, pinching his ear to make it red, as he rubbed	356.4430151765856
his hands to make them white, “and then I made a certain _rondeau_ upon	244.75992421705513
it last year, which I showed to Monsieur Voiture, and that great man	213.0333910279075
paid me a thousand compliments.”	185.34850610600625
“A _rondeau!_” said the Jesuit, disdainfully.	258.106746095384
“A _rondeau!_” said the curate, mechanically.	324.81919133892274
“Repeat it! Repeat it!” cried D’Artagnan; “it will make a little	297.9336520796751
change.”	316.1418742744501
“Not so, for it is religious,” replied Aramis; “it is theology in	289.56045478050044
verse.”	339.27630703585316
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan.	176.69846259104867
“Here it is,” said Aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which,	210.70868171727054
however, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy:	206.70398033935948
“Vous qui pleurez un passé plein de charmes,	183.69688513628208
    Et qui trainez des jours infortunés,	320.4369552272402
    Tous vos malheurs se verront terminés,	177.11748818007493
Quand à Dieu seul vous offrirez vos larmes,	289.5009669506846
        Vous qui pleurez!”	330.0442250730049
“You who weep for pleasures fled,	322.70345854005717
    While dragging on a life of care,	329.45812584959333
    All your woes will melt in air,	190.68434475673632
If to God your tears are shed,	189.71081386619477
        You who weep!”	261.93333823098976
D’Artagnan and the curate appeared pleased. The Jesuit persisted in his	172.90497778238102
opinion. “Beware of a profane taste in your theological style. What	258.5349657507976
says Augustine on this subject: ‘_Severus sit clericorum verbo_.’”	333.1833188960908
“Yes, let the sermon be clear,” said the curate.	250.8570512864476
“Now,” hastily interrupted the Jesuit, on seeing that his acolyte was	187.60565235429897
going astray, “now your thesis would please the ladies; it would have	176.3301677626537
the success of one of Monsieur Patru’s pleadings.”	210.5366436827016
“Please God!” cried Aramis, transported.	288.126058633955
“There it is,” cried the Jesuit; “the world still speaks within you in	210.13668049510574
a loud voice, _altisimâ voce_. You follow the world, my young friend,	273.1762054154812
and I tremble lest grace prove not efficacious.”	328.6486424507812
“Be satisfied, my reverend father, I can answer for myself.”	187.53195727134565
“Mundane presumption!”	354.6359933445235
“I know myself, Father; my resolution is irrevocable.”	206.65027108544996
“Then you persist in continuing that thesis?”	230.06633041285795
“I feel myself called upon to treat that, and no other. I will see	281.7628391570958
about the continuation of it, and tomorrow I hope you will be satisfied	344.08153813617326
with the corrections I shall have made in consequence of your advice.”	365.66445793062974
“Work slowly,” said the curate; “we leave you in an excellent tone of	237.35605361599312
mind.”	235.63839400569682
“Yes, the ground is all sown,” said the Jesuit, “and we have not to	261.81094161005586
fear that one portion of the seed may have fallen upon stone, another	324.4066215035392
upon the highway, or that the birds of heaven have eaten the rest,	294.7621962413285
_aves cœli comederunt illam_.”	166.90109756393016
“Plague stifle you and your Latin!” said D’Artagnan, who began to feel	266.07308083769
all his patience exhausted.	222.33905768222334
“Farewell, my son,” said the curate, “till tomorrow.”	279.9653654751012
“Till tomorrow, rash youth,” said the Jesuit. “You promise to become	246.67078801269628
one of the lights of the Church. Heaven grant that this light prove not	222.71050863865338
a devouring fire!”	199.9572781725976
D’Artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with	293.96923688089544
impatience, was beginning to attack the quick.	327.74244855324685
The two men in black rose, bowed to Aramis and D’Artagnan, and advanced	324.3827915976699
toward the door. Bazin, who had been standing listening to all this	254.38107194076983
controversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the	319.5011359562859
breviary of the curate and the missal of the Jesuit, and walked	233.39742581164847
respectfully before them to clear their way.	311.4369197466973
Aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately	182.22157821183535
came up again to D’Artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of	247.09541590476294
confusion.	215.30433632533013
When left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.	216.64946351850446
It however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as	219.21715429613724
D’Artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion,	256.6457716758651
Aramis said, “you see that I am returned to my fundamental ideas.”	303.3838447375473
“Yes, efficacious grace has touched you, as that gentleman said just	272.1980473782708
now.”	292.78515705748123
“Oh, these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time. You have	284.75084567582496
often heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?”	274.3906195344905
“Yes; but I confess I always thought you jested.”	359.7770425469174
“With such things! Oh, D’Artagnan!”	331.34391161182657
“The devil! Why, people jest with death.”	186.84123547776153
“And people are wrong, D’Artagnan; for death is the door which leads to	205.17052794316538
perdition or to salvation.”	302.84590849774156
“Granted; but if you please, let us not theologize, Aramis. You must	224.76981065401628
have had enough for today. As for me, I have almost forgotten the	273.3378579407289
little Latin I have ever known. Then I confess to you that I have eaten	350.161967859736
nothing since ten o’clock this morning, and I am devilish hungry.”	259.6834295218731
“We will dine directly, my friend; only you must please to remember	297.1573001579813
that this is Friday. Now, on such a day I can neither eat flesh nor see	253.20373345106918
it eaten. If you can be satisfied with my dinner—it consists of cooked	296.9107134925032
tetragones and fruits.”	179.7568061981446
“What do you mean by tetragones?” asked D’Artagnan, uneasily.	247.7969790258703
“I mean spinach,” replied Aramis; “but on your account I will add some	216.50383907340435
eggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule—for eggs are meat,	308.2355243121421
since they engender chickens.”	316.28530899793213
“This feast is not very succulent; but never mind, I will put up with	184.01591096980886
it for the sake of remaining with you.”	333.64836156650586
“I am grateful to you for the sacrifice,” said Aramis; “but if your	289.15355297094743
body be not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will.”	190.92984916663258
“And so, Aramis, you are decidedly going into the Church? What will our	222.02768196724728
two friends say? What will Monsieur de Tréville say? They will treat	289.49424309373205
you as a deserter, I warn you.”	339.33878669485193
“I do not enter the Church; I re-enter it. I deserted the Church for	329.68990347957424
the world, for you know that I forced myself when I became a	243.32493937415444
Musketeer.”	354.5195003203112
“I? I know nothing about it.”	243.05152947651126
“You don’t know I quit the seminary?”	233.3276158199488
“Not at all.”	202.95971084429303
“This is my story, then. Besides, the Scriptures say, ‘Confess	334.92675773149494
yourselves to one another,’ and I confess to you, D’Artagnan.”	292.3837257590843
“And I give you absolution beforehand. You see I am a good sort of a	359.0550264711397
man.”	318.91100250577176
“Do not jest about holy things, my friend.”	171.60506398648243
“Go on, then, I listen.”	347.5260048038925
“I had been at the seminary from nine years old; in three days I should	253.08388660638772
have been twenty. I was about to become an abbé, and all was arranged.	193.0219089208868
One evening I went, according to custom, to a house which I frequented	211.46309197484783
with much pleasure: when one is young, what can be expected?—one is	265.5492350927382
weak. An officer who saw me, with a jealous eye, reading the _Lives of	177.97904672263007
the Saints_ to the mistress of the house, entered suddenly and without	226.6088705141664
being announced. That evening I had translated an episode of Judith,	358.5260082044101
and had just communicated my verses to the lady, who gave me all sorts	262.8286748517117
of compliments, and leaning on my shoulder, was reading them a second	179.56110532899828
time with me. Her pose, which I must admit was rather free, wounded	333.8304314810808
this officer. He said nothing; but when I went out he followed, and	290.9491920368189
quickly came up with me. ‘Monsieur the Abbé,’ said he, ‘do you like	333.058024207646
blows with a cane?’ ‘I cannot say, monsieur,’ answered I; ‘no one has	180.51021297904413
ever dared to give me any.’ ‘Well, listen to me, then, Monsieur the	214.6691765110831
Abbé! If you venture again into the house in which I have met you this	215.45617242889435
evening, I will dare it myself.’ I really think I must have been	168.08669050743293
frightened. I became very pale; I felt my legs fail me; I sought for a	196.94755710057592
reply, but could find none—I was silent. The officer waited for his	282.87116349709413
reply, and seeing it so long coming, he burst into a laugh, turned upon	343.24540583597354
his heel, and re-entered the house. I returned to the seminary.	209.73590494386528
“I am a gentleman born, and my blood is warm, as you may have remarked,	282.10380790788554
my dear D’Artagnan. The insult was terrible, and although unknown to	251.13918522414815
the rest of the world, I felt it live and fester at the bottom of my	361.73242142680886
heart. I informed my superiors that I did not feel myself sufficiently	300.80050971513117
prepared for ordination, and at my request the ceremony was postponed	234.01623337495863
for a year. I sought out the best fencing master in Paris, I made an	361.2601551942139
agreement with him to take a lesson every day, and every day for a year	360.711402102451
I took that lesson. Then, on the anniversary of the day on which I had	256.04423190595264
been insulted, I hung my cassock on a peg, assumed the costume of a	317.5270882941942
cavalier, and went to a ball given by a lady friend of mine and to	309.4214975800501
which I knew my man was invited. It was in the Rue des	206.28456610825515
France-Bourgeois, close to La Force. As I expected, my officer was	252.81575952792463
there. I went up to him as he was singing a love ditty and looking	217.72115592315572
tenderly at a lady, and interrupted him exactly in the middle of the	237.51931043583568
second couplet. ‘Monsieur,’ said I, ‘does it still displease you that I	337.4072597915354
should frequent a certain house of La Rue Payenne? And would you still	300.67221575299203
cane me if I took it into my head to disobey you? The officer looked at	184.62004159563205
me with astonishment, and then said, ‘What is your business with me,	315.3921329610401
monsieur? I do not know you.’ ‘I am,’ said I, ‘the little abbé who	183.11893382849877
reads _Lives of the Saints_, and translates Judith into verse.’ ‘Ah,	285.0774608596555
ah! I recollect now,’ said the officer, in a jeering tone; ‘well, what	198.9319581454005
do you want with me?’ ‘I want you to spare time to take a walk with	185.61082360346964
me.’ ‘Tomorrow morning, if you like, with the greatest pleasure.’ ‘No,	266.8715929612282
not tomorrow morning, if you please, but immediately.’ ‘If you	300.38533349887837
absolutely insist.’ ‘I do insist upon it.’ ‘Come, then. Ladies,’ said	218.5825015015484
the officer, ‘do not disturb yourselves; allow me time just to kill	269.4570559645996
this gentleman, and I will return and finish the last couplet.’	250.04364758372216
“We went out. I took him to the Rue Payenne, to exactly the same spot	246.42668949022635
where, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the	358.05848893014934
compliment I have related to you. It was a superb moonlight night. We	291.37492616294844
immediately drew, and at the first pass I laid him stark dead.”	182.18400620741664
“The devil!” cried D’Artagnan.	302.2309435054152
“Now,” continued Aramis, “as the ladies did not see the singer come	238.3117575962662
back, and as he was found in the Rue Payenne with a great sword wound	232.09220337897884
through his body, it was supposed that I had accommodated him thus; and	285.9722906826997
the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the	240.65741293670783
cassock for a time. Athos, whose acquaintance I made about that period,	327.87702191126505
and Porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective	176.88808140262225
tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a	175.85803609790418
Musketeer. The king entertained great regard for my father, who had	207.97230914903014
fallen at the siege of Arras, and the uniform was granted. You may	363.75456157277256
understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the	363.3221366888802
Church.”	253.49507915877132
“And why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow? What has happened to	277.2989300718323
you today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?”	328.3351207479168
“This wound, my dear D’Artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven.”	356.04905105641626
“This wound? Bah, it is now nearly healed, and I am sure it is not that	365.98175338894873
which gives you the most pain.”	222.11054084677681
“What, then?” said Aramis, blushing.	283.4056429831709
“You have one at heart, Aramis, one deeper and more painful—a wound	219.38628593966277
made by a woman.”	207.84254232070145
The eye of Aramis kindled in spite of himself.	273.34915636542695
“Ah,” said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness,	277.41605073733433
“do not talk of such things, and suffer love pains? _Vanitas	296.57946591692547
vanitatum!_ According to your idea, then, my brain is turned. And for	323.8948592772588
whom—for some _grisette_, some chambermaid with whom I have trifled in	232.4320733859567
some garrison? Fie!”	260.954143496557
“Pardon, my dear Aramis, but I thought you carried your eyes higher.”	192.6038910883325
“Higher? And who am I, to nourish such ambition? A poor Musketeer, a	341.8019822056006
beggar, an unknown—who hates slavery, and finds himself ill-placed in	280.25195164315926
the world.”	344.98269191094374
“Aramis, Aramis!” cried D’Artagnan, looking at his friend with an air	207.5891653578044
of doubt.	342.46546486928764
“Dust I am, and to dust I return. Life is full of humiliations and	221.68403115611625
sorrows,” continued he, becoming still more melancholy; “all the ties	294.5821190097378
which attach him to life break in the hand of man, particularly the	338.6865294665961
golden ties. Oh, my dear D’Artagnan,” resumed Aramis, giving to his	355.35137012408757
voice a slight tone of bitterness, “trust me! Conceal your wounds when	233.59180803284426
you have any; silence is the last joy of the unhappy. Beware of giving	302.2545449923165
anyone the clue to your griefs; the curious suck our tears as flies	201.27780273385804
suck the blood of a wounded hart.”	168.94598682343522
“Alas, my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, in his turn heaving a profound	342.61766862362396
sigh, “that is my story you are relating!”	247.12988792874353
“How?”	169.26077973725634
“Yes; a woman whom I love, whom I adore, has just been torn from me by	331.243129764513
force. I do not know where she is or whither they have conducted her.	273.31216687778334
She is perhaps a prisoner; she is perhaps dead!”	177.86387658287188
“Yes, but you have at least this consolation, that you can say to	214.24230659928338
yourself she has not quit you voluntarily, that if you learn no news of	177.1082011681451
her, it is because all communication with you is interdicted; while I—”	327.77780710305717
“Well?”	198.610249459902
“Nothing,” replied Aramis, “nothing.”	166.9182335796146
“So you renounce the world, then, forever; that is a settled thing—a	182.41462987660677
resolution registered!”	360.7338217161289
“Forever! You are my friend today; tomorrow you will be no more to me	360.43808832639445
than a shadow, or rather, even, you will no longer exist. As for the	289.47967146028674
world, it is a sepulcher and nothing else.”	229.0951829616481
“The devil! All this is very sad which you tell me.”	183.06974341262156
“What will you? My vocation commands me; it carries me away.”	308.29517811093797
D’Artagnan smiled, but made no answer.	186.76903265184666
Aramis continued, “And yet, while I do belong to the earth, I wish to	253.85019494315875
speak of you—of our friends.”	191.11454199505368
“And on my part,” said D’Artagnan, “I wished to speak of you, but I	339.40984765162693
find you so completely detached from everything! To love you cry, ‘Fie!	181.96062402367988
Friends are shadows! The world is a sepulcher!’”	209.29143888845033
“Alas, you will find it so yourself,” said Aramis, with a sigh.	176.86707841745763
“Well, then, let us say no more about it,” said D’Artagnan; “and let us	352.78316505959174
burn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh	199.29120319661484
infidelity of your _grisette_ or your chambermaid.”	250.4690461925764
“What letter?” cried Aramis, eagerly.	287.96451147404235
“A letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was	200.60587387456272
given to me for you.”	212.61723824044813
“But from whom is that letter?”	224.64217947383867
“Oh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding _grisette;_	217.31100054045342
from Madame de Chevreuse’s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to	305.795354206844
return to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart	360.2497666974265
and attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a	363.0500573474007
duchess’s coronet.”	273.32442311692773
“What do you say?”	358.43640770768184
“Hold! I must have lost it,” said the young man maliciously, pretending	275.9321237622956
to search for it. “But fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men,	213.48269918683994
and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to	241.33404750786158
which you cry, ‘Fie! Fie!’”	273.86262860575334
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan,” cried Aramis, “you are killing me!”	350.10601098630684
“Well, here it is at last!” said D’Artagnan, as he drew the letter from	270.54460987110565
his pocket.	361.7478741502324
Aramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it,	209.4103096471884
his countenance radiant.	359.97267016041235
“This same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style,” said the	354.91790838119033
messenger, carelessly.	183.86768196937766
“Thanks, D’Artagnan, thanks!” cried Aramis, almost in a state of	363.0591958191813
delirium. “She was forced to return to Tours; she is not faithless; she	187.20107802573602
still loves me! Come, my friend, come, let me embrace you. Happiness	290.8704483721276
almost stifles me!”	311.4033355921838
The two friends began to dance around the venerable St. Chrysostom,	298.7309380090269
kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis, which had fallen on	235.3437388630677
the floor.	305.53630335825017
At that moment Bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet.	354.1417743535139
“Be off, you wretch!” cried Aramis, throwing his skullcap in his face.	364.4759015538614
“Return whence you came; take back those horrible vegetables, and that	250.65748957100408
poor kickshaw! Order a larded hare, a fat capon, mutton leg dressed	227.8339541751432
with garlic, and four bottles of old Burgundy.”	331.3389894769742
Bazin, who looked at his master, without comprehending the cause of	348.0331266249985
this change, in a melancholy manner, allowed the omelet to slip into	340.0925359771443
the spinach, and the spinach onto the floor.	312.91356258100075
“Now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the King of	332.2465167566083
kings,” said D’Artagnan, “if you persist in offering him a civility.	290.99823573538924
_Non inutile desiderium oblatione_.”	365.6778972933781
“Go to the devil with your Latin. Let us drink, my dear D’Artagnan,	306.3860098334819
_morbleu!_ Let us drink while the wine is fresh! Let us drink heartily,	228.93907327635398
and while we do so, tell me a little of what is going on in the world	226.95629015335712
yonder.”	188.6332093610206
Chapter XXVII.	269.1974481071272
THE WIFE OF ATHOS	339.98395753135196
We have now to search for Athos,” said D’Artagnan to the vivacious	181.75684640047805
Aramis, when he had informed him of all that had passed since their	273.99140109351794
departure from the capital, and an excellent dinner had made one of	335.897673390338
them forget his thesis and the other his fatigue.	333.7294903174022
“Do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?” asked	341.23703635667994
Aramis. “Athos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so	255.4269490247139
skillfully.”	355.39062835289826
“No doubt. Nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of	363.71638771502944
Athos than I have; but I like better to hear my sword clang against	314.4757776292198
lances than against staves. I fear lest Athos should have been beaten	340.38065505764854
down by serving men. Those fellows strike hard, and don’t leave off in	170.0074659880063
a hurry. This is why I wish to set out again as soon as possible.”	361.6517717389927
“I will try to accompany you,” said Aramis, “though I scarcely feel in	181.09714616641443
a condition to mount on horseback. Yesterday I undertook to employ that	194.35197914260854
cord which you see hanging against the wall, but pain prevented my	249.78307541408526
continuing the pious exercise.”	185.4513634274419
“That’s the first time I ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot	252.12978842137932
wounds with cat-o’-nine-tails; but you were ill, and illness renders	347.1826197672987
the head weak, therefore you may be excused.”	360.8434138239153
“When do you mean to set out?”	328.0490408833963
“Tomorrow at daybreak. Sleep as soundly as you can tonight, and	334.01585348643664
tomorrow, if you can, we will take our departure together.”	206.38490751269208
“Till tomorrow, then,” said Aramis; “for iron-nerved as you are, you	289.46005032063465
must need repose.”	225.76846640200307
The next morning, when D’Artagnan entered Aramis’s chamber, he found	206.55717937162873
him at the window.	245.29276152076278
“What are you looking at?” asked D’Artagnan.	245.7418080257973
“My faith! I am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys	175.18706239100206
are leading about. It would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel	187.62281514904254
upon such horses.”	263.744347384124
“Well, my dear Aramis, you may enjoy that pleasure, for one of those	263.8600476779721
three horses is yours.”	196.68529055611103
“Ah, bah! Which?”	305.5684360208385
“Whichever of the three you like, I have no preference.”	175.92228444742426
“And the rich caparison, is that mine, too?”	201.78868834577787
“Without doubt.”	311.94850890089003
“You laugh, D’Artagnan.”	176.71259076078567
“No, I have left off laughing, now that you speak French.”	254.29057875302772
“What, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded	348.8556030016263
with silver—are they all for me?”	292.34000374383913
“For you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine,	343.86896904328853
and the other horse, which is caracoling, belongs to Athos.”	275.151165847547
“_Peste!_ They are three superb animals!”	344.306251739554
“I am glad they please you.”	337.9907037472941
“Why, it must have been the king who made you such a present.”	175.33261691795389
“Certainly it was not the cardinal; but don’t trouble yourself whence	218.95671458934723
they come, think only that one of the three is your property.”	264.5228707321288
“I choose that which the red-headed boy is leading.”	261.0191782316035
“It is yours!”	303.2927573838739
“Good heaven! That is enough to drive away all my pains; I could mount	255.31993436020912
him with thirty balls in my body. On my soul, handsome stirrups!	317.5746356469602
_Holà_, Bazin, come here this minute.”	353.00686909465844
Bazin appeared on the threshold, dull and spiritless.	272.54337710389956
“That last order is useless,” interrupted D’Artagnan; “there are loaded	295.59233435091465
pistols in your holsters.”	207.25418014611006
Bazin sighed.	354.7816856279901
“Come, Monsieur Bazin, make yourself easy,” said D’Artagnan; “people of	241.40169164710687
all conditions gain the kingdom of heaven.”	299.82960845284674
“Monsieur was already such a good theologian,” said Bazin, almost	299.6443020719325
weeping; “he might have become a bishop, and perhaps a cardinal.”	257.5813988881936
“Well, but my poor Bazin, reflect a little. Of what use is it to be a	169.09407830820282
churchman, pray? You do not avoid going to war by that means; you see,	238.65541951264402
the cardinal is about to make the next campaign, helm on head and	227.77844030468765
partisan in hand. And Monsieur de Nogaret de la Valette, what do you	253.31212626900506
say of him? He is a cardinal likewise. Ask his lackey how often he has	313.7968200282945
had to prepare lint of him.”	283.4314336331753
“Alas!” sighed Bazin. “I know it, monsieur; everything is turned	310.51611966060057
topsy-turvy in the world nowadays.”	187.57877259791246
While this dialogue was going on, the two young men and the poor lackey	236.2629443427694
descended.	217.93183145559993
“Hold my stirrup, Bazin,” cried Aramis; and Aramis sprang into the	231.0991017726509
saddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults and	265.3557971908574
curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so	348.20001225454996
insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.	305.87729663674145
D’Artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,	347.11311717183537
sprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his	300.5359040852969
chamber.	346.82820901331877
“That’s all right, my dear Aramis, take care of yourself,” said he; “I	271.914405050288
will go alone in search of Athos.”	359.2023342400371
“You are a man of brass,” replied Aramis.	285.793595899974
“No, I have good luck, that is all. But how do you mean to pass your	175.522506212876
time till I come back? No more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers	276.4976337176615
or upon benedictions, hey?”	222.18955336831772
Aramis smiled. “I will make verses,” said he.	224.82275146953955
“Yes, I dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the	240.18828266413698
attendant of Madame de Chevreuse. Teach Bazin prosody; that will	274.6570833765587
console him. As to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that	268.4628410750187
will accustom you to his maneuvers.”	328.6904207058793
“Oh, make yourself easy on that head,” replied Aramis. “You will find	290.4413873918184
me ready to follow you.”	214.5825118779557
They took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having	186.44991320543753
commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and Bazin, D’Artagnan	228.2085864214319
was trotting along in the direction of Amiens.	346.95363489263445
How was he going to find Athos? Should he find him at all? The position	221.81751717089787
in which he had left him was critical. He probably had succumbed. This	256.484533244752
idea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused	263.3017169755004
him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. Of all his	175.59347823435857
friends, Athos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in	188.06387280951773
appearance, in his tastes and sympathies.	203.27280913157665
Yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. The noble	261.34242971692174
and distinguished air of Athos, those flashes of greatness which from	184.46356265881556
time to time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept	267.170956267342
himself, that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most	361.25263675967403
pleasant companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that	300.44165510375603
bravery which might have been termed blind if it had not been the	216.6561688136173
result of the rarest coolness—such qualities attracted more than the	270.6873951272879
esteem, more than the friendship of D’Artagnan; they attracted his	247.50013973898285
admiration.	327.09162002080643
Indeed, when placed beside M. de Tréville, the elegant and noble	341.41782753731195
courtier, Athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain	169.67686000958759
a comparison. He was of middle height; but his person was so admirably	252.22366506524196
shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles	315.6127965475124
with Porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was	362.13636234769217
proverbial among the Musketeers. His head, with piercing eyes, a	256.5010650701329
straight nose, a chin cut like that of Brutus, had altogether an	173.09731897247406
indefinable character of grandeur and grace. His hands, of which he	246.7374174636047
took little care, were the despair of Aramis, who cultivated his with	350.2330791252614
almond paste and perfumed oil. The sound of his voice was at once	168.0491524477075
penetrating and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in	355.7215640709891
Athos, who was always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the	326.54031342652473
world and of the usages of the most brilliant society—those manners of	301.0476112802819
a high degree which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his	343.3243181705752
least actions.	299.1424944182102
If a repast were on foot, Athos presided over it better than any other,	341.80889200160397
placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned	224.54753144010067
for him or that he had made for himself. If a question in heraldry were	255.2940276308484
started, Athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom, their	232.975310265347
genealogy, their alliances, their coats of arms, and the origin of	363.5654782584826
them. Etiquette had no minutiæ unknown to him. He knew what were the	335.5526338347503
rights of the great land owners. He was profoundly versed in hunting	342.1124007185448
and falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art	311.2330480354062
astonished even Louis XIII. himself, who took a pride in being	293.4335852876852
considered a past master therein.	233.16260565999823
Like all the great nobles of that period, Athos rode and fenced to	267.0109281538908
perfection. But still further, his education had been so little	295.90310346312344
neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this	214.44773729499946
time among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of Latin which	177.87323378628577
Aramis sported and which Porthos pretended to understand. Two or three	266.2649893584581
times, even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when	349.1764524128322
Aramis allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in	306.73695783114937
its right tense and a noun in its case. Besides, his probity was	168.57223095099673
irreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with	328.72525317008046
their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy	235.4042467334653
of our era, and the poor with God’s Seventh Commandment. This Athos,	213.52849535825257
then, was a very extraordinary man.	268.38551259639917
And yet this nature so distinguished, this creature so beautiful, this	295.88339607559396
essence so fine, was seen to turn insensibly toward material life, as	314.1455655415541
old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility. Athos, in his hours	306.9421529449953
of gloom—and these hours were frequent—was extinguished as to the whole	211.05505040783356
of the luminous portion of him, and his brilliant side disappeared as	307.91584851923454
into profound darkness.	353.88877849329356
Then the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man. His head hanging	167.48576129634728
down, his eye dull, his speech slow and painful, Athos would look for	328.7575053717345
hours together at his bottle, his glass, or at Grimaud, who, accustomed	169.87586233760337
to obey him by signs, read in the faint glance of his master his least	363.0740674875384
desire, and satisfied it immediately. If the four friends were	329.87892700759
assembled at one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally	299.4012665452129
with a violent effort, was the share Athos furnished to the	313.5285404237982
conversation. In exchange for his silence Athos drank enough for four,	296.47936110498847
and without appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more	187.21169573211648
marked constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.	334.6666564404609
D’Artagnan, whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with, had	175.30201932688686
not—whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this	359.8647240698239
subject—been able to assign any cause for these fits, or for the	277.11161574259717
periods of their recurrence. Athos never received any letters; Athos	218.28408476344907
never had concerns which all his friends did not know.	265.1440522185696
It could not be said that it was wine which produced this sadness; for	179.2233973391178
in truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as	179.9501678159905
we have said, rendered still darker. This excess of bilious humor could	265.5751951351952
not be attributed to play; for unlike Porthos, who accompanied the	316.23324088783204
variations of chance with songs or oaths, Athos when he won remained as	312.46489099597426
unmoved as when he lost. He had been known, in the circle of the	349.8143048969761
Musketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them	185.88167269023367
even to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again	254.8676905039481
with the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow	181.06901433597736
being heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their	338.43661650650733
pearly hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening,	305.9092872437599
ceasing to be calm and agreeable.	298.2507544333356
Neither was it, as with our neighbors, the English, an atmospheric	343.6927608964162
influence which darkened his countenance; for the sadness generally	305.7978615694105
became more intense toward the fine season of the year. June and July	268.7391841417881
were the terrible months with Athos.	170.98775973865258
For the present he had no anxiety. He shrugged his shoulders when	265.7542295870519
people spoke of the future. His secret, then, was in the past, as had	218.85772629291463
often been vaguely said to D’Artagnan.	359.50457795660316
This mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still	238.24043593974363
more interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete	215.41359110032192
intoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions	242.6476496302753
had been put to him.	270.2095125503873
“Well,” thought D’Artagnan, “poor Athos is perhaps at this moment dead,	203.86609163901508
and dead by my fault—for it was I who dragged him into this affair, of	283.51011421713036
which he did not know the origin, of which he is ignorant of the	217.8685367944082
result, and from which he can derive no advantage.”	272.26668567970546
“Without reckoning, monsieur,” added Planchet to his master’s audibly	260.4478735649235
expressed reflections, “that we perhaps owe our lives to him. Do you	265.6325070000068
remember how he cried, ‘On, D’Artagnan, on, I am taken’? And when he	337.4898519166997
had discharged his two pistols, what a terrible noise he made with his	208.47905417937943
sword! One might have said that twenty men, or rather twenty mad	212.63499577645234
devils, were fighting.”	170.3344557030706
These words redoubled the eagerness of D’Artagnan, who urged his horse,	302.6380720724844
though he stood in need of no incitement, and they proceeded at a rapid	219.6724386917499
pace. About eleven o’clock in the morning they perceived Amiens, and at	188.61715800946305
half past eleven they were at the door of the cursed inn.	197.935777249293
D’Artagnan had often meditated against the perfidious host one of those	311.6781171574838
hearty vengeances which offer consolation while they are hoped for. He	272.6184299803631
entered the hostelry with his hat pulled over his eyes, his left hand	260.1128476514757
on the pommel of the sword, and cracking his whip with his right hand.	226.23476366971255
“Do you remember me?” said he to the host, who advanced to greet him.	250.21785085362703
“I have not that honor, monseigneur,” replied the latter, his eyes	189.2664596251388
dazzled by the brilliant style in which D’Artagnan traveled.	251.49370105350613
“What, you don’t know me?”	257.83647552748675
“No, monseigneur.”	211.56729693233083
“Well, two words will refresh your memory. What have you done with that	282.77600917287657
gentleman against whom you had the audacity, about twelve days ago, to	204.01013769977726
make an accusation of passing false money?”	359.40961283829245
The host became as pale as death; for D’Artagnan had assumed a	361.6018993832191
threatening attitude, and Planchet modeled himself after his master.	213.7672875659576
“Ah, monseigneur, do not mention it!” cried the host, in the most	238.36011468244772
pitiable voice imaginable. “Ah, monseigneur, how dearly have I paid for	231.33148456306677
that fault, unhappy wretch as I am!”	184.10973702209753
“That gentleman, I say, what has become of him?”	289.2580471151159
“Deign to listen to me, monseigneur, and be merciful! Sit down, in	247.0446603318336
mercy!”	324.5875821775871
D’Artagnan, mute with anger and anxiety, took a seat in the threatening	169.85390554156987
attitude of a judge. Planchet glared fiercely over the back of his	221.76126125854296
armchair.	265.81185759955173
“Here is the story, monseigneur,” resumed the trembling host; “for I	362.3482371146804
now recollect you. It was you who rode off at the moment I had that	299.34820580122295
unfortunate difference with the gentleman you speak of.”	250.760280013952
“Yes, it was I; so you may plainly perceive that you have no mercy to	200.02520569178176
expect if you do not tell me the whole truth.”	315.2070312378702
“Condescend to listen to me, and you shall know all.”	278.7565293080145
“I listen.”	310.72306013693276
“I had been warned by the authorities that a celebrated coiner of bad	216.7054830547745
money would arrive at my inn, with several of his companions, all	359.0529674600276
disguised as Guards or Musketeers. Monseigneur, I was furnished with a	252.71565134680378
description of your horses, your lackeys, your countenances—nothing was	356.59558794157033
omitted.”	172.97484389506525
“Go on, go on!” said D’Artagnan, who quickly understood whence such an	320.80829683112245
exact description had come.	294.06175305503643
“I took then, in conformity with the orders of the authorities, who	358.50417943389755
sent me a reinforcement of six men, such measures as I thought	330.46270721214006
necessary to get possession of the persons of the pretended coiners.”	355.80901973152856
“Again!” said D’Artagnan, whose ears chafed terribly under the	276.6141324980788
repetition of this word _coiners_.	183.729956618984
“Pardon me, monseigneur, for saying such things, but they form my	199.92716060295783
excuse. The authorities had terrified me, and you know that an	230.6159987875415
innkeeper must keep on good terms with the authorities.”	172.68931149036445
“But once again, that gentleman—where is he? What has become of him? Is	319.5008105532945
he dead? Is he living?”	233.4771610249229
“Patience, monseigneur, we are coming to it. There happened then that	349.06863913635766
which you know, and of which your precipitate departure,” added the	180.7110313790397
host, with an acuteness that did not escape D’Artagnan, “appeared to	283.18553730644885
authorize the issue. That gentleman, your friend, defended himself	221.0082433347775
desperately. His lackey, who, by an unforeseen piece of ill luck, had	356.32719137965734
quarreled with the officers, disguised as stable lads—”	221.73013423917718
“Miserable scoundrel!” cried D’Artagnan, “you were all in the plot,	228.70765765175196
then! And I really don’t know what prevents me from exterminating you	346.31328700617865
all.”	166.26874203146994
“Alas, monseigneur, we were not in the plot, as you will soon see.	352.048459321265
Monsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name	183.73486299879247
which no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), Monsieur your	257.1149969574205
friend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting	215.28722824877713
with his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me	207.9465329103789
with a blow of the flat side of it.”	280.0749841540911
“You villain, will you finish?” cried D’Artagnan, “Athos—what has	213.8879221684745
become of Athos?”	304.1456182645269
“While fighting and retreating, as I have told Monseigneur, he found	174.24980878694373
the door of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he	265.6829490810171
took out the key, and barricaded himself inside. As we were sure of	258.1023612123692
finding him there, we left him alone.”	289.8585326896283
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “you did not really wish to kill; you only	191.2629950137922
wished to imprison him.”	284.29250617650325
“Good God! To imprison him, monseigneur? Why, he imprisoned himself, I	249.06922978553195
swear to you he did. In the first place he had made rough work of it;	291.1602262043275
one man was killed on the spot, and two others were severely wounded.	224.15567102389912
The dead man and the two wounded were carried off by their comrades,	358.50743161521973
and I have heard nothing of either of them since. As for myself, as	319.7382959093114
soon as I recovered my senses I went to Monsieur the Governor, to whom	224.8912188696507
I related all that had passed, and asked, what I should do with my	222.01718991093907
prisoner. Monsieur the Governor was all astonishment. He told me he	365.343793345779
knew nothing about the matter, that the orders I had received did not	314.15028862181845
come from him, and that if I had the audacity to mention his name as	208.84981874885526
being concerned in this disturbance he would have me hanged. It appears	218.2635232863576
that I had made a mistake, monsieur, that I had arrested the wrong	246.97695639285456
person, and that he whom I ought to have arrested had escaped.”	244.54428018205567
“But Athos!” cried D’Artagnan, whose impatience was increased by the	193.43601278492994
disregard of the authorities, “Athos, where is he?”	272.1364602240208
“As I was anxious to repair the wrongs I had done the prisoner,”	239.25003507193844
resumed the innkeeper, “I took my way straight to the cellar in order	166.24520578292498
to set him at liberty. Ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a	298.7042073267483
devil! To my offer of liberty, he replied that it was nothing but a	262.6001951098659
snare, and that before he came out he intended to impose his own	240.03577715875883
conditions. I told him very humbly—for I could not conceal from myself	299.0975303342195
the scrape I had got into by laying hands on one of his Majesty’s	278.3862528236273
Musketeers—I told him I was quite ready to submit to his conditions.	343.6003451243476
“‘In the first place,’ said he, ‘I wish my lackey placed with me, fully	215.03088942673241
armed.’ We hastened to obey this order; for you will please to	344.4548990147654
understand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend	234.94083358175175
could desire. Monsieur Grimaud (he told us his name, although he does	274.4265122284681
not talk much)—Monsieur Grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded	274.0912011087274
as he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door	284.51443178449153
afresh, and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar.”	191.63011568628093
“But where is Athos now?” cried D’Artagnan. “Where is Athos?”	241.79254902312363
“In the cellar, monsieur.”	197.92769871390715
“What, you scoundrel! Have you kept him in the cellar all this time?”	180.75711495741896
“Merciful heaven! No, monsieur! We keep him in the cellar! You do not	257.0288158330716
know what he is about in the cellar. Ah! If you could but persuade him	218.13131068883067
to come out, monsieur, I should owe you the gratitude of my whole life;	283.0298183318839
I should adore you as my patron saint!”	302.4623501483789
“Then he is there? I shall find him there?”	168.22235857396157
“Without doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remaining there. We	181.34348293549735
every day pass through the air hole some bread at the end of a fork,	272.9640019962499
and some meat when he asks for it; but alas! It is not of bread and	262.5443387931832
meat of which he makes the greatest consumption. I once endeavored to	229.55517376791488
go down with two of my servants; but he flew into terrible rage. I	290.8890145984798
heard the noise he made in loading his pistols, and his servant in	216.9880049015979
loading his musketoon. Then, when we asked them what were their	346.8546519562916
intentions, the master replied that he had forty charges to fire, and	262.32412716383357
that he and his lackey would fire to the last one before he would allow	267.44284074743456
a single soul of us to set foot in the cellar. Upon this I went and	208.0731842650006
complained to the governor, who replied that I only had what I	308.71162810848745
deserved, and that it would teach me to insult honorable gentlemen who	209.14013258660682
took up their abode in my house.”	347.31906655193393
“So that since that time—” replied D’Artagnan, totally unable to	219.3493299714117
refrain from laughing at the pitiable face of the host.	301.4316409380914
“So from that time, monsieur,” continued the latter, “we have led the	247.19132531196834
most miserable life imaginable; for you must know, monsieur, that all	353.84449022197487
our provisions are in the cellar. There is our wine in bottles, and our	211.22396026463844
wine in casks; the beer, the oil, and the spices, the bacon, and	310.2227401194553
sausages. And as we are prevented from going down there, we are forced	246.32889730905703
to refuse food and drink to the travelers who come to the house; so	339.4206810722013
that our hostelry is daily going to ruin. If your friend remains	177.43817982081606
another week in my cellar I shall be a ruined man.”	362.0233755386146
“And not more than justice, either, you ass! Could you not perceive by	330.00671569473207
our appearance that we were people of quality, and not coiners—say?”	202.45780543136303
“Yes, monsieur, you are right,” said the host. “But, hark, hark! There	290.538573417953
he is!”	253.80209107897156
“Somebody has disturbed him, without doubt,” said D’Artagnan.	316.5300249655261
“But he must be disturbed,” cried the host; “Here are two English	294.6874747028698
gentlemen just arrived.”	209.45882337133162
“Well?”	328.8026135004493
“Well, the English like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these	255.35041113942395
have asked for the best. My wife has perhaps requested permission of	308.55636080836246
Monsieur Athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and	202.5972484315385
he, as usual, has refused. Ah, good heaven! There is the hullabaloo	360.107450525275
louder than ever!”	274.3366449816134
D’Artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar.	231.52129117225684
He rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by	268.089143459229
Planchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of	268.53433933821435
action.	334.6307669910683
The two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were	228.0437097647126
dying with hunger and thirst.	291.3529136415748
“But this is tyranny!” cried one of them, in very good French, though	276.10750350094287
with a foreign accent, “that this madman will not allow these good	296.5800476072383
people access to their own wine! Nonsense, let us break open the door,	242.84844444759852
and if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!”	211.06477070780807
“Softly, gentlemen!” said D’Artagnan, drawing his pistols from his	228.4067408378078
belt, “you will kill nobody, if you please!”	186.19522270569985
“Good, good!” cried the calm voice of Athos, from the other side of the	281.71797939740327
door, “let them just come in, these devourers of little children, and	191.61335940710285
we shall see!”	364.12906175052444
Brave as they appeared to be, the two English gentlemen looked at each	350.0144694178686
other hesitatingly. One might have thought there was in that cellar one	189.2486437450413
of those famished ogres—the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into	211.95598803692658
whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.	198.47990702371956
There was a moment of silence; but at length the two Englishmen felt	263.83689850961053
ashamed to draw back, and the angrier one descended the five or six	260.0930810065885
steps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough	244.62933068603695
to split a wall.	187.75565402693337
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, cocking his pistols, “I will take charge	220.62367985574156
of the one at the top; you look to the one below. Ah, gentlemen, you	229.90660606987043
want battle; and you shall have it.”	300.62296583598106
“Good God!” cried the hollow voice of Athos, “I can hear D’Artagnan, I	301.0850141485741
think.”	263.0109741419682
“Yes,” cried D’Artagnan, raising his voice in turn, “I am here, my	284.7316306103582
friend.”	230.34999087454338
“Ah, good, then,” replied Athos, “we will teach them, these door	353.1125080317536
breakers!”	285.1783728277792
The gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken	174.04330862396083
between two fires. They still hesitated an instant; but, as before,	254.66778860338934
pride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.	213.81167864123836
“Stand on one side, D’Artagnan, stand on one side,” cried Athos. “I am	197.71205130879892
going to fire!”	307.44757971458466
“Gentlemen,” exclaimed D’Artagnan, whom reflection never abandoned,	338.5166060527172
“gentlemen, think of what you are about. Patience, Athos! You are	232.02855195764522
running your heads into a very silly affair; you will be riddled. My	190.54852823453678
lackey and I will have three shots at you, and you will get as many	341.0935462529769
from the cellar. You will then have our swords, with which, I can	207.70112244639296
assure you, my friend and I can play tolerably well. Let me conduct	208.0575397532918
your business and my own. You shall soon have something to drink; I	183.52293202763477
give you my word.”	218.30819144208692
“If there is any left,” grumbled the jeering voice of Athos.	268.0956662422448
The host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.	173.50483285307826
“How! ‘If there is any left!’” murmured he.	344.7844718836668
“What the devil! There must be plenty left,” replied D’Artagnan. “Be	335.366220021687
satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.	194.3653164112355
Gentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards.”	224.91521838556986
“Well, provided you replace your pistols in your belt.”	233.57775111850452
“Willingly.”	207.8112928583693
And D’Artagnan set the example. Then, turning toward Planchet, he made	330.9455180746894
him a sign to uncock his musketoon.	298.27741254933085
The Englishmen, convinced of these peaceful proceedings, sheathed their	328.86950622633753
swords grumblingly. The history of Athos’s imprisonment was then	192.9497270424639
related to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the	173.60116982009302
host in the wrong.	255.45338451314456
“Now, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “go up to your room again; and in	357.7641003897094
ten minutes, I will answer for it, you shall have all you desire.”	318.35891500661603
The Englishmen bowed and went upstairs.	226.0771875519111
“Now I am alone, my dear Athos,” said D’Artagnan; “open the door, I beg	263.2127300918928
of you.”	203.49242393573587
“Instantly,” said Athos.	177.15959078542053
Then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the	260.2303956349622
groaning of posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of Athos,	182.2607983525423
which the besieged himself demolished.	277.51818237026964
An instant after, the broken door was removed, and the pale face of	197.4027242083419
Athos appeared, who with a rapid glance took a survey of the	198.14329454839816
surroundings.	174.43398836592291
D’Artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly. He then	239.76369442396452
tried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he	245.2609679327253
perceived that Athos staggered.	360.48512177087196
“You are wounded,” said he.	282.37932620198245
“I! Not at all. I am dead drunk, that’s all, and never did a man more	209.96039600718953
strongly set about getting so. By the Lord, my good host! I must at	363.34499919984773
least have drunk for my part a hundred and fifty bottles.”	173.98226067049183
“Mercy!” cried the host, “if the lackey has drunk only half as much as	219.02907484894715
the master, I am a ruined man.”	182.31899557568767
“Grimaud is a well-bred lackey. He would never think of faring in the	354.02557461734375
same manner as his master; he only drank from the cask. Hark! I don’t	342.1105194290702
think he put the faucet in again. Do you hear it? It is running now.”	220.8400288662899
D’Artagnan burst into a laugh which changed the shiver of the host into	314.37297661332894
a burning fever.	208.82397536201015
In the meantime, Grimaud appeared in his turn behind his master, with	293.8211952174944
the musketoon on his shoulder, and his head shaking. Like one of those	185.66877265449688
drunken satyrs in the pictures of Rubens. He was moistened before and	302.290017307399
behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive	326.66734212352776
oil.	193.37003531869445
The four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of	215.9778425268863
the best apartment in the house, which D’Artagnan occupied with	255.81953084342163
authority.	191.07658158606233
In the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the	208.69146775335597
cellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a	327.07092084650384
frightful spectacle awaited them.	220.01180178323696
Beyond the fortifications through which Athos had made a breach in	207.5930614916051
order to get out, and which were composed of fagots, planks, and empty	249.86210985184206
casks, heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art, they	197.02104591561778
found, swimming in puddles of oil and wine, the bones and fragments of	233.1167498073635
all the hams they had eaten; while a heap of broken bottles filled the	205.54382955370806
whole left-hand corner of the cellar, and a tun, the cock of which was	193.36542108498816
left running, was yielding, by this means, the last drop of its blood.	293.7288602200003
“The image of devastation and death,” as the ancient poet says,	234.6197645755036
“reigned as over a field of battle.”	312.91415887716516
Of fifty large sausages, suspended from the joists, scarcely ten	291.70736338393624
remained.	310.8022878700938
Then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the	207.43574248617043
cellar. D’Artagnan himself was moved by them. Athos did not even turn	294.85749192089236
his head.	171.23167758129392
To grief succeeded rage. The host armed himself with a spit, and rushed	315.212178785104
into the chamber occupied by the two friends.	305.3908585072787
“Some wine!” said Athos, on perceiving the host.	339.1573974823122
“Some wine!” cried the stupefied host, “some wine? Why you have drunk	293.11693003650487
more than a hundred pistoles’ worth! I am a ruined man, lost,	187.83063156127054
destroyed!”	252.24266773181347
“Bah,” said Athos, “we were always dry.”	273.3558760732257
“If you had been contented with drinking, well and good; but you have	279.064391337546
broken all the bottles.”	237.5111520820913
“You pushed me upon a heap which rolled down. That was your fault.”	287.91989127332295
“All my oil is lost!”	275.1442250544885
“Oil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor Grimaud here was	342.4154645327609
obliged to dress those you had inflicted on him.”	359.35580061650046
“All my sausages are gnawed!”	329.47877618234236
“There is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar.”	175.29838749492225
“You shall pay me for all this,” cried the exasperated host.	340.99259209576127
“Triple ass!” said Athos, rising; but he sank down again immediately.	285.43061882637994
He had tried his strength to the utmost. D’Artagnan came to his relief	265.32660313278484
with his whip in his hand.	168.572425547868
The host drew back and burst into tears.	356.52681919617925
“This will teach you,” said D’Artagnan, “to treat the guests God sends	228.57475057522367
you in a more courteous fashion.”	244.53554869101072
“God? Say the devil!”	281.50417937053356
“My dear friend,” said D’Artagnan, “if you annoy us in this manner we	166.08348251242515
will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see	188.3301268510595
if the mischief is as great as you say.”	208.72077185308476
“Oh, gentlemen,” said the host, “I have been wrong. I confess it, but	235.81191306462887
pardon to every sin! You are gentlemen, and I am a poor innkeeper. You	285.1724914778627
will have pity on me.”	338.35467198099013
“Ah, if you speak in that way,” said Athos, “you will break my heart,	266.308209014944
and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.	333.25833396620413
We are not such devils as we appear to be. Come hither, and let us	263.5902428761795
talk.”	300.6802738685109
The host approached with hesitation.	260.41963402215663
“Come hither, I say, and don’t be afraid,” continued Athos. “At the	209.08027639513227
very moment when I was about to pay you, I had placed my purse on the	169.68484218046004
table.”	293.99209621175805
“Yes, monsieur.”	196.77726618240757
“That purse contained sixty pistoles; where is it?”	288.0671772182865
“Deposited with the justice; they said it was bad money.”	204.33454694079313
“Very well; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles.”	295.7821221428974
“But Monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which	166.34774327025823
it once lays hold of. If it were bad money, there might be some hopes;	238.1173857073088
but unfortunately, those were all good pieces.”	244.2553024033819
“Manage the matter as well as you can, my good man; it does not concern	337.7154022490855
me, the more so as I have not a livre left.”	313.98999990228936
“Come,” said D’Artagnan, “let us inquire further. Athos’s horse, where	192.46681548862952
is that?”	266.7904598246401
“In the stable.”	173.88705876737112
“How much is it worth?”	361.4593539955955
“Fifty pistoles at most.”	266.5318478383093
“It’s worth eighty. Take it, and there ends the matter.”	270.5403042299161
“What,” cried Athos, “are you selling my horse—my Bajazet? And pray	363.3693569473837
upon what shall I make my campaign; upon Grimaud?”	289.6573901657518
“I have brought you another,” said D’Artagnan.	323.5894869818045
“Another?”	354.6827742100961
“And a magnificent one!” cried the host.	226.4759845924848
“Well, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the	252.14062081998514
old one; and let us drink.”	197.8670980553302
“What?” asked the host, quite cheerful again.	316.3488100009887
“Some of that at the bottom, near the laths. There are twenty-five	198.40942686403676
bottles of it left; all the rest were broken by my fall. Bring six of	227.03124417950605
them.”	321.7868300062455
“Why, this man is a cask!” said the host, aside. “If he only remains	249.620365902986
here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, I shall soon	338.6638689314382
re-establish my business.”	170.6711981194845
“And don’t forget,” said D’Artagnan, “to bring up four bottles of the	333.0559144252833
same sort for the two English gentlemen.”	214.73700670034003
“And now,” said Athos, “while they bring the wine, tell me, D’Artagnan,	282.0123718931346
what has become of the others, come!”	309.6497671227444
D’Artagnan related how he had found Porthos in bed with a strained	203.09160082687777
knee, and Aramis at a table between two theologians. As he finished,	201.16112186935504
the host entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for	302.5614269755125
him, had been left out of the cellar.	297.713263928167
“That’s well!” said Athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;	358.9758095711531
“here’s to Porthos and Aramis! But you, D’Artagnan, what is the matter	220.16754860825228
with you, and what has happened to you personally? You have a sad air.”	228.30127159472136
“Alas,” said D’Artagnan, “it is because I am the most unfortunate.”	346.1294394838643
“Tell me.”	196.3268498323605
“Presently,” said D’Artagnan.	212.74830338815744
“Presently! And why presently? Because you think I am drunk?	337.5558255718547
D’Artagnan, remember this! My ideas are never so clear as when I have	196.41866643456237
had plenty of wine. Speak, then, I am all ears.”	346.39972906652997
D’Artagnan related his adventure with Mme. Bonacieux. Athos listened to	279.75848989848265
him without a frown; and when he had finished, said, “Trifles, only	324.00230498733475
trifles!” That was his favorite word.	236.36655103937102
“You always say _trifles_, my dear Athos!” said D’Artagnan, “and that	311.12689976434854
comes very ill from you, who have never loved.”	277.4518418304855
The drink-deadened eye of Athos flashed out, but only for a moment; it	352.2844898929536
became as dull and vacant as before.	317.2484925411161
“That’s true,” said he, quietly, “for my part I have never loved.”	246.09400977320354
“Acknowledge, then, you stony heart,” said D’Artagnan, “that you are	232.0870996705058
wrong to be so hard upon us tender hearts.”	180.2293798175322
“Tender hearts! Pierced hearts!” said Athos.	213.59381008600255
“What do you say?”	328.02115403858875
“I say that love is a lottery in which he who wins, wins death! You are	318.3749174148908
very fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear D’Artagnan. And if I	169.42306840262293
have any counsel to give, it is, always lose!”	201.84298503162088
“She seemed to love me so!”	351.1818740253086
“She _seemed_, did she?”	244.09637995006975
“Oh, she _did_ love me!”	270.29377351860444
“You child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,	252.20917982950766
that his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been	344.8560367088711
deceived by his mistress.”	291.54039203097807
“Except you, Athos, who never had one.”	196.1101579113507
“That’s true,” said Athos, after a moment’s silence, “that’s true! I	204.12017076231072
never had one! Let us drink!”	272.98702918733096
“But then, philosopher that you are,” said D’Artagnan, “instruct me,	335.91088985081836
support me. I stand in need of being taught and consoled.”	232.54843079366174
“Consoled for what?”	283.57234790206326
“For my misfortune.”	300.2816721753291
“Your misfortune is laughable,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders; “I	303.2834099778393
should like to know what you would say if I were to relate to you a	278.2995531517747
real tale of love!”	229.08692339205152
“Which has happened to you?”	360.5293938732318
“Or one of my friends, what matters?”	329.2082927664969
“Tell it, Athos, tell it.”	230.06660614788956
“Better if I drink.”	190.5426440127505
“Drink and relate, then.”	339.58196957974246
“Not a bad idea!” said Athos, emptying and refilling his glass. “The	329.19996388577283
two things agree marvelously well.”	365.19604344556706
“I am all attention,” said D’Artagnan.	173.27531030516639
Athos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, D’Artagnan saw	226.6434067481468
that he became pale. He was at that period of intoxication in which	266.44461926922713
vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep. He kept himself	211.38416205156125
upright and dreamed, without sleeping. This somnambulism of drunkenness	215.2447625099721
had something frightful in it.	345.8924100683316
“You particularly wish it?” asked he.	169.1665600133212
“I pray for it,” said D’Artagnan.	288.7911139692653
“Be it then as you desire. One of my friends—one of my friends, please	282.5715844343914
to observe, not myself,” said Athos, interrupting himself with a	292.83920334627095
melancholy smile, “one of the counts of my province—that is to say, of	341.39828322723974
Berry—noble as a Dandolo or a Montmorency, at twenty-five years of age	353.6427793225679
fell in love with a girl of sixteen, beautiful as fancy can paint.	199.85503581828726
Through the ingenuousness of her age beamed an ardent mind, not of the	218.3591755061084
woman, but of the poet. She did not please; she intoxicated. She lived	293.8000594337807
in a small town with her brother, who was a curate. Both had recently	358.09451204128413
come into the country. They came nobody knew whence; but when seeing	180.82950218486982
her so lovely and her brother so pious, nobody thought of asking whence	292.51835964882304
they came. They were said, however, to be of good extraction. My	177.5265562108187
friend, who was seigneur of the country, might have seduced her, or	267.26833367401093
taken her by force, at his will—for he was master. Who would have come	312.56433816279286
to the assistance of two strangers, two unknown persons? Unfortunately	254.14522942980233
he was an honorable man; he married her. The fool! The ass! The idiot!”	173.71671790510754
“How so, if he loved her?” asked D’Artagnan.	309.0405024309183
“Wait,” said Athos. “He took her to his château, and made her the first	166.53313841839687
lady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she	317.51311555147583
supported her rank becomingly.”	258.18299768826785
“Well?” asked D’Artagnan.	225.84798024640588
“Well, one day when she was hunting with her husband,” continued Athos,	233.00030197499515
in a low voice, and speaking very quickly, “she fell from her horse and	333.67628660279956
fainted. The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be	292.5417264233068
oppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in	334.1775641976217
so doing laid bare her shoulder. D’Artagnan,” said Athos, with a	291.92177283404146
maniacal burst of laughter, “guess what she had on her shoulder.”	243.1132901002855
“How can I tell?” said D’Artagnan.	299.1030068239899
“A _fleur-de-lis_,” said Athos. “She was branded.”	243.06755811763838
Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand.	216.75201193167052
“Horror!” cried D’Artagnan. “What do you tell me?”	229.11059023871243
“Truth, my friend. The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had	291.88203141762176
stolen the sacred vessels from a church.”	277.1569365523227
“And what did the count do?”	259.0509995171368
“The count was of the highest nobility. He had on his estates the	234.559597016172
rights of high and low tribunals. He tore the dress of the countess to	203.07939234166813
pieces; he tied her hands behind her, and hanged her on a tree.”	306.5766782812145
“Heavens, Athos, a murder?” cried D’Artagnan.	286.7305380158663
“No less,” said Athos, as pale as a corpse. “But methinks I need wine!”	249.56683588758676
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his	238.58514925130737
mouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an	276.39287768375243
ordinary glass.	302.80409068298917
Then he let his head sink upon his two hands, while D’Artagnan stood	176.27383528510288
before him, stupefied.	200.89230330840286
“That has cured me of beautiful, poetical, and loving women,” said	176.0412949495289
Athos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting to	208.32033508250012
continue the fiction of the count. “God grant you as much! Let us	193.51989885836147
drink.”	264.2209906720709
“Then she is dead?” stammered D’Artagnan.	230.21725550506486
“_Parbleu!_” said Athos. “But hold out your glass. Some ham, my boy, or	338.29576876337813
we can’t drink.”	356.97737622891685
“And her brother?” added D’Artagnan, timidly.	183.8168951077905
“Her brother?” replied Athos.	263.58866883350765
“Yes, the priest.”	231.0266138203229
“Oh, I inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise; but	196.54103105058607
he was beforehand with me, he had quit the curacy the night before.”	220.62015295959958
“Was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?”	214.35573251671585
“He was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady. A	271.1963013357265
worthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting	304.4624065754367
his mistress married, and securing her a position. He has been hanged	166.23854592463786
and quartered, I hope.”	268.1165199814189
“My God, my God!” cried D’Artagnan, quite stunned by the relation of	188.46883471433867
this horrible adventure.	222.01854851320022
“Taste some of this ham, D’Artagnan; it is exquisite,” said Athos,	332.4391462387235
cutting a slice, which he placed on the young man’s plate.	251.51947837613068
“What a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar. I	235.4843798322094
could have drunk fifty bottles more.”	194.46342483027763
D’Artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him	286.3509095887877
bewildered. Allowing his head to sink upon his two hands, he pretended	219.5660386633065
to sleep.	282.5795280032219
“These young fellows can none of them drink,” said Athos, looking at	233.64829656689307
him with pity, “and yet this is one of the best!”	216.67407720598828
Chapter XXVIII.	308.4806206816247
THE RETURN	207.03263390646276
D’Artagnan was astounded by the terrible confidence of Athos; yet many	281.5958017407462
things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation. In the	276.5443051553417
first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half	336.45168356956844
drunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or	299.39753644439554
four bottles of Burgundy carries with it to the brain, D’Artagnan, when	332.89343760705736
awaking on the following morning, had all the words of Athos as present	263.6344528557836
to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth—they had been so	221.87549177088619
impressed upon his mind. All this doubt only gave rise to a more lively	227.156270851945
desire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend’s	332.52320742413167
chamber with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the	323.8287498937801
preceding evening; but he found Athos quite himself again—that is to	315.15958202849447
say, the most shrewd and impenetrable of men. Besides which, the	356.18530985509216
Musketeer, after having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him,	266.86160375559007
broached the matter first.	184.16921779454162
“I was pretty drunk yesterday, D’Artagnan,” said he, “I can tell that	336.06865106700104
by my tongue, which was swollen and hot this morning, and by my pulse,	302.0841816334978
which was very tremulous. I wager that I uttered a thousand	226.2264673333412
extravagances.”	244.74281792833762
While saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that	234.81434659362742
embarrassed him.	212.96689719560632
“No,” replied D’Artagnan, “if I recollect well what you said, it was	289.35484646557893
nothing out of the common way.”	196.26033064318202
“Ah, you surprise me. I thought I had told you a most lamentable	283.6726579804209
story.” And he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom	246.32208499803008
of his heart.	315.51972099148935
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan, “it appears that I was more drunk than	276.136228904557
you, since I remember nothing of the kind.”	167.18493063677798
Athos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; “you cannot have failed	197.17694929611883
to remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of	294.9291121835698
drunkenness, sad or gay. My drunkenness is always sad, and when I am	256.1706323489765
thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which	255.18210851269845
my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain. That is my failing—a capital	176.35697159622435
failing, I admit; but with that exception, I am a good drinker.”	244.12494561235297
Athos spoke this in so natural a manner that D’Artagnan was shaken in	257.7726653322356
his conviction.	345.3694749690917
“It is that, then,” replied the young man, anxious to find out the	210.3609381346327
truth, “it is that, then, I remember as we remember a dream. We were	253.8766445299255
speaking of hanging.”	235.5961919823667
“Ah, you see how it is,” said Athos, becoming still paler, but yet	344.77702170918724
attempting to laugh; “I was sure it was so—the hanging of people is my	167.08742946670358
nightmare.”	339.28239832930814
“Yes, yes,” replied D’Artagnan. “I remember now; yes, it was about—stop	230.572576606256
a minute—yes, it was about a woman.”	217.6050909743875
“That’s it,” replied Athos, becoming almost livid; “that is my grand	328.6316262667311
story of the fair lady, and when I relate that, I must be very drunk.”	287.09488676966663
“Yes, that was it,” said D’Artagnan, “the story of a tall, fair lady,	327.63069888352334
with blue eyes.”	261.6645793910139
“Yes, who was hanged.”	191.58061021385402
“By her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance,” continued	332.3663985302918
D’Artagnan, looking intently at Athos.	306.0654788350014
“Well, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know	242.31431525268397
what he says,” replied Athos, shrugging his shoulders as if he thought	334.5603202582091
himself an object of pity. “I certainly never will get drunk again,	361.514758379467
D’Artagnan; it is too bad a habit.”	169.57873955294232
D’Artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at	194.41876141922182
once, Athos said:	242.74696729288772
“By the by, I thank you for the horse you have brought me.”	254.2237172294524
“Is it to your mind?” asked D’Artagnan.	334.77618073478345
“Yes; but it is not a horse for hard work.”	177.3404427013301
“You are mistaken; I rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour	339.5453450678592
and a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made	169.20282805210678
the tour of the Place St. Sulpice.”	191.6520197509921
“Ah, you begin to awaken my regret.”	327.56799843885335
“Regret?”	222.84410976790937
“Yes; I have parted with him.”	336.8109126548285
“How?”	252.46014575033325
“Why, here is the simple fact. This morning I awoke at six o’clock. You	217.68357583579558
were still fast asleep, and I did not know what to do with myself; I	241.3208028047366
was still stupid from our yesterday’s debauch. As I came into the	291.4213572374975
public room, I saw one of our Englishman bargaining with a dealer for a	349.3382552326128
horse, his own having died yesterday from bleeding. I drew near, and	358.8092456211423
found he was bidding a hundred pistoles for a chestnut nag.	203.50703103589507
‘_Pardieu_,’ said I, ‘my good gentleman, I have a horse to sell, too.’	187.5233232743752
‘Ay, and a very fine one! I saw him yesterday; your friend’s lackey was	325.9438876217642
leading him.’ ‘Do you think he is worth a hundred pistoles?’ ‘Yes! Will	331.2836193746019
you sell him to me for that sum?’ ‘No; but I will play for him.’	258.4329378752585
‘What?’ ‘At dice.’ No sooner said than done, and I lost the horse. Ah,	249.4292342274719
ah! But please to observe I won back the equipage,” cried Athos.	174.9714558539743
D’Artagnan looked much disconcerted.	202.13836121618203
“This vexes you?” said Athos.	356.20658437260147
“Well, I must confess it does,” replied D’Artagnan. “That horse was to	283.0802526980584
have identified us in the day of battle. It was a pledge, a	244.02604712020587
remembrance. Athos, you have done wrong.”	331.66488782669273
“But, my dear friend, put yourself in my place,” replied the Musketeer.	359.73222458896464
“I was hipped to death; and still further, upon my honor, I don’t like	334.3687984376113
English horses. If it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will	252.54974088938434
suffice for that; it is quite remarkable enough. As to the horse, we	184.79797401791376
can easily find some excuse for its disappearance. Why the devil! A	283.2550395509642
horse is mortal; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy?”	334.33616189340654
D’Artagnan did not smile.	172.59753063293894
“It vexes me greatly,” continued Athos, “that you attach so much	234.7107747034762
importance to these animals, for I am not yet at the end of my story.”	341.9060403966344
“What else have you done.”	174.0296657207711
“After having lost my own horse, nine against ten—see how near—I formed	360.88020917096594
an idea of staking yours.”	244.54383734000294
“Yes; but you stopped at the idea, I hope?”	202.0440508986763
“No; for I put it in execution that very minute.”	239.6357303824637
“And the consequence?” said D’Artagnan, in great anxiety.	229.13582026093138
“I threw, and I lost.”	270.5791288609865
“What, my horse?”	298.63722382318014
“Your horse, seven against eight; a point short—you know the proverb.”	264.0864084314204
“Athos, you are not in your right senses, I swear.”	185.1171008390815
“My dear lad, that was yesterday, when I was telling you silly stories,	300.44921539784497
it was proper to tell me that, and not this morning. I lost him then,	298.666296635449
with all his appointments and furniture.”	302.6109148107347
“Really, this is frightful.”	182.52193436724576
“Stop a minute; you don’t know all yet. I should make an excellent	228.2994667379354
gambler if I were not too hot-headed; but I was hot-headed, just as if	226.36022505439917
I had been drinking. Well, I was not hot-headed then—”	247.1330193026904
“Well, but what else could you play for? You had nothing left?”	170.48467558771142
“Oh, yes, my friend; there was still that diamond left which sparkles	189.34558328511423
on your finger, and which I had observed yesterday.”	208.13378520776226
“This diamond!” said D’Artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.	196.70178354944943
“And as I am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own	234.3171453982185
once, I estimated it at a thousand pistoles.”	309.80116811380896
“I hope,” said D’Artagnan, half dead with fright, “you made no mention	285.1189875005224
of my diamond?”	320.2642345998478
“On the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only	283.06262895622643
resource; with it I might regain our horses and their harnesses, and	208.58825902191688
even money to pay our expenses on the road.”	320.3934137714319
“Athos, you make me tremble!” cried D’Artagnan.	270.76533696041616
“I mentioned your diamond then to my adversary, who had likewise	305.7225705938928
remarked it. What the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star	363.62771161716785
from heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it? Impossible!”	273.2349682544804
“Go on, go on, my dear fellow!” said D’Artagnan; “for upon my honor,	352.37320710801174
you will kill me with your indifference.”	349.33940224788057
“We divided, then, this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles	295.86778924798244
each.”	320.4283019258563
“You are laughing at me, and want to try me!” said D’Artagnan, whom	259.626134881432
anger began to take by the hair, as Minerva takes Achilles, in the	252.3460167263894
_Iliad_.	220.41802311368306
“No, I do not jest, _mordieu!_ I should like to have seen you in my	364.9190465446373
place! I had been fifteen days without seeing a human face, and had	358.2631745026774
been left to brutalize myself in the company of bottles.”	350.2643185039203
“That was no reason for staking my diamond!” replied D’Artagnan,	297.88616890500873
closing his hand with a nervous spasm.	244.41983954098683
“Hear the end. Ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws,	258.10750445411816
without revenge; in thirteen throws I had lost all—in thirteen throws.	199.98730710389026
The number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of	256.1374000851287
July that—”	278.3645996646072
“_Ventrebleu!_” cried D’Artagnan, rising from the table, the story of	283.1394904708601
the present day making him forget that of the preceding one.	207.38613857018683
“Patience!” said Athos; “I had a plan. The Englishman was an original;	282.2433107900962
I had seen him conversing that morning with Grimaud, and Grimaud had	347.1718178642591
told me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service. I	198.2176496419616
staked Grimaud, the silent Grimaud, divided into ten portions.”	208.41636255416313
“Well, what next?” said D’Artagnan, laughing in spite of himself.	298.869848175236
“Grimaud himself, understand; and with the ten parts of Grimaud, which	354.8788380036833
are not worth a ducatoon, I regained the diamond. Tell me, now, if	226.90289937809757
persistence is not a virtue?”	200.07082923683353
“My faith! But this is droll,” cried D’Artagnan, consoled, and holding	211.6624307578006
his sides with laughter.	334.41460800643483
“You may guess, finding the luck turned, that I again staked the	215.36784944815514
diamond.”	250.6450403498402
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, becoming angry again.	246.2639134808081
“I won back your harness, then your horse, then my harness, then my	297.486252812127
horse, and then I lost again. In brief, I regained your harness and	339.72467032847226
then mine. That’s where we are. That was a superb throw, so I left off	340.5587831022789
there.”	206.5942526344565
D’Artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his	355.79044773487726
breast.	193.5597638535881
“Then the diamond is safe?” said he, timidly.	356.38093412362207
“Intact, my dear friend; besides the harness of your Bucephalus and	358.33849926030575
mine.”	194.42115264693717
“But what is the use of harnesses without horses?”	239.26379139401763
“I have an idea about them.”	217.1295946073504
“Athos, you make me shudder.”	231.39205392434934
“Listen to me. You have not played for a long time, D’Artagnan.”	255.2787078985033
“And I have no inclination to play.”	354.75461701576893
“Swear to nothing. You have not played for a long time, I said; you	178.29423224332425
ought, then, to have a good hand.”	303.3580783630374
“Well, what then?”	277.05850221251177
“Well; the Englishman and his companion are still here. I remarked that	299.7054225180316
he regretted the horse furniture very much. You appear to think much of	228.3248890964852
your horse. In your place I would stake the furniture against the	166.9598677600405
horse.”	321.52417233643683
“But he will not wish for only one harness.”	338.8926905305826
“Stake both, _pardieu!_ I am not selfish, as you are.”	312.680143370254
“You would do so?” said D’Artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the	247.5879589165612
confidence of Athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.	360.23192800613515
“On my honor, in one single throw.”	313.9978532335182
“But having lost the horses, I am particularly anxious to preserve the	188.41457461633794
harnesses.”	311.83784645262426
“Stake your diamond, then.”	216.89451920170856
“This? That’s another matter. Never, never!”	278.4666467630848
“The devil!” said Athos. “I would propose to you to stake Planchet, but	295.599374249039
as that has already been done, the Englishman would not, perhaps, be	181.90440387293376
willing.”	266.71120588451254
“Decidedly, my dear Athos,” said D’Artagnan, “I should like better not	211.66448998368173
to risk anything.”	346.3077191231786
“That’s a pity,” said Athos, coolly. “The Englishman is overflowing	344.23408719066856
with pistoles. Good Lord, try one throw! One throw is soon made!”	301.19492606594224
“And if I lose?”	269.35262395395847
“You will win.”	199.77298921432828
“But if I lose?”	303.6807728306504
“Well, you will surrender the harnesses.”	184.1291856224948
“Have with you for one throw!” said D’Artagnan.	252.4033057497157
Athos went in quest of the Englishman, whom he found in the stable,	311.70306459549994
examining the harnesses with a greedy eye. The opportunity was good. He	201.48175718966425
proposed the conditions—the two harnesses, either against one horse or	302.77969316111853
a hundred pistoles. The Englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses	187.70807527563085
were worth three hundred pistoles. He consented.	285.86509128819836
D’Artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the	278.1134032987959
number three; his paleness terrified Athos, who, however, consented	308.223179315322
himself with saying, “That’s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the	296.32584480765786
horses fully equipped, monsieur.”	301.0737090686883
The Englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble	240.86138850756325
to shake the dice. He threw them on the table without looking at them,	261.4206790906728
so sure was he of victory; D’Artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill	205.8597776382743
humor.	291.6167204070273
“Hold, hold, hold!” said Athos, wit his quiet tone; “that throw of the	211.7612085684662
dice is extraordinary. I have not seen such a one four times in my	297.580175156625
life. Two aces!”	295.0163347468589
The Englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment. D’Artagnan	189.26759715326307
looked, and was seized with pleasure.	320.73280539580816
“Yes,” continued Athos, “four times only; once at the house of Monsieur	184.13297863174378
Créquy; another time at my own house in the country, in my château	174.18164421748045
at—when I had a château; a third time at Monsieur de Tréville’s where	354.7725260691766
it surprised us all; and the fourth time at a cabaret, where it fell to	166.1622451845413
my lot, and where I lost a hundred louis and a supper on it.”	323.2776688621783
“Then Monsieur takes his horse back again,” said the Englishman.	237.50186753525327
“Certainly,” said D’Artagnan.	182.93913574702816
“Then there is no revenge?”	292.8289040904008
“Our conditions said, ‘No revenge,’ you will please to recollect.”	234.5881075539004
“That is true; the horse shall be restored to your lackey, monsieur.”	328.42319386894724
“A moment,” said Athos; “with your permission, monsieur, I wish to	359.7574144198394
speak a word with my friend.”	337.3909454378677
“Say on.”	171.97770198262987
Athos drew D’Artagnan aside.	306.9582165539188
“Well, Tempter, what more do you want with me?” said D’Artagnan. “You	263.3268695792931
want me to throw again, do you not?”	259.06150902442255
“No, I would wish you to reflect.”	178.59480418233525
“On what?”	303.88588632012807
“You mean to take your horse?”	206.01924987331844
“Without doubt.”	238.4094056817977
“You are wrong, then. I would take the hundred pistoles. You know you	280.03894158274693
have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles, at	226.18126699904184
your choice.”	313.8478024325741
“Yes.”	167.4423640351035
“Well, then, I repeat, you are wrong. What is the use of one horse for	316.56265030511616
us two? I could not ride behind. We should look like the two sons of	206.3933594941326
Aymon, who had lost their brother. You cannot think of humiliating me	168.6833581996537
by prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger. For my part,	308.2248940053148
I should not hesitate a moment; I should take the hundred pistoles. We	285.99226998012387
want money for our return to Paris.”	285.0748631838034
“I am much attached to that horse, Athos.”	274.0262421697846
“And there again you are wrong. A horse slips and injures a joint; a	346.93004871557105
horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a	173.76032479108792
manger in which a glandered horse has eaten. There is a horse, while on	272.41468768487493
the contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master.”	330.6948776818049
“But how shall we get back?”	296.56111198153746
“Upon our lackey’s horses, _pardieu_. Anybody may see by our bearing	203.95020844079605
that we are people of condition.”	237.968594486079
“Pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while Aramis and Porthos	166.90489483805766
caracole on their steeds.”	191.85362738695994
“Aramis! Porthos!” cried Athos, and laughed aloud.	204.08352480900973
“What is it?” asked D’Artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the	307.14289032417537
hilarity of his friend.	191.7789045577945
“Nothing, nothing! Go on!”	212.89234119818795
“Your advice, then?”	227.481242245499
“To take the hundred pistoles, D’Artagnan. With the hundred pistoles we	253.00574907836804
can live well to the end of the month. We have undergone a great deal	285.52596335630074
of fatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm.”	288.47390153302206
“I rest? Oh, no, Athos. Once in Paris, I shall prosecute my search for	201.37882869684796
that unfortunate woman!”	173.11153584024436
“Well, you may be assured that your horse will not be half so	179.84722243017367
serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis. Take the	258.7490589630853
hundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!”	331.3405404128131
D’Artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. This last reason	225.58377900851465
appeared convincing. Besides, he feared that by resisting longer he	303.07107625721426
should appear selfish in the eyes of Athos. He acquiesced, therefore,	365.61839996266895
and chose the hundred pistoles, which the Englishman paid down on the	261.84641947438377
spot.	300.0163381699714
They then determined to depart. Peace with the landlord, in addition to	298.82489816210784
Athos’s old horse, cost six pistoles. D’Artagnan and Athos took the	320.54827628314206
nags of Planchet and Grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot,	281.6815763416772
carrying the saddles on their heads.	357.33789462827326
However ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance	177.5481337032129
of their servants, and arrived at Crèvecœur. From a distance they	296.4702469955235
perceived Aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking	297.3712723881023
out, like Sister Anne, at the dust in the horizon.	328.5494183393223
“_Holà_, Aramis! What the devil are you doing there?” cried the two	172.58965959939158
friends.	225.81665437415225
“Ah, is that you, D’Artagnan, and you, Athos?” said the young man. “I	240.0113855953374
was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world	187.92557512094183
leave us. My English horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud of	278.90165203586855
dust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the	261.48407160223377
things of the earth. Life itself may be resolved into three words:	233.0231923989101
_Erat, est, fuit_.”	218.1479192485664
“Which means—” said D’Artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.	303.4881534019116
“Which means that I have just been duped—sixty louis for a horse which	236.85361831380914
by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour.”	269.7557749390837
D’Artagnan and Athos laughed aloud.	264.72645651465587
“My dear D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, “don’t be too angry with me, I beg.	349.43036369601646
Necessity has no law; besides, I am the person punished, as that	241.073587901482
rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. Ah, you	276.9040712984494
fellows are good managers! You ride on our lackey’s horses, and have	215.7158452078758
your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages.”	340.23874886484975
At the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had	176.54222905643095
appeared upon the Amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and Planchet and	264.3009931514008
Grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. The cart was	188.73315387125524
returning empty to Paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their	260.19860658326525
transport, to slake the wagoner’s thirst along the route.	314.57475412021904
“What is this?” said Aramis, on seeing them arrive. “Nothing but	170.73360198903202
saddles?”	187.41539638566462
“Now do you understand?” said Athos.	185.35137270590775
“My friends, that’s exactly like me! I retained my harness by instinct.	175.24106105485717
_Holà_, Bazin! Bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of	191.89298485377594
these gentlemen.”	273.01434121941344
“And what have you done with your ecclesiastics?” asked D’Artagnan.	278.8650312003133
“My dear fellow, I invited them to a dinner the next day,” replied	168.4235340120322
Aramis. “They have some capital wine here—please to observe that in	177.57811346382766
passing. I did my best to make them drunk. Then the curate forbade me	318.98008190107106
to quit my uniform, and the Jesuit entreated me to get him made a	329.765924622615
Musketeer.”	299.42759695737186
“Without a thesis?” cried D’Artagnan, “without a thesis? I demand the	297.8472933484318
suppression of the thesis.”	330.64058846747673
“Since then,” continued Aramis, “I have lived very agreeably. I have	275.70095743702456
begun a poem in verses of one syllable. That is rather difficult, but	299.7239795955659
the merit in all things consists in the difficulty. The matter is	183.9193592142324
gallant. I will read you the first canto. It has four hundred lines,	212.19835310190098
and lasts a minute.”	361.96055981845245
“My faith, my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, who detested verses almost	335.5586841669373
as much as he did Latin, “add to the merit of the difficulty that of	324.91504997375534
the brevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two	224.7507832058538
merits.”	205.08064070233314
“You will see,” continued Aramis, “that it breathes irreproachable	209.38245184792396
passion. And so, my friends, we return to Paris? Bravo! I am ready. We	307.391238954502
are going to rejoin that good fellow, Porthos. So much the better. You	283.9223087079334
can’t think how I have missed him, the great simpleton. To see him so	299.22762157227305
self-satisfied reconciles me with myself. He would not sell his horse;	221.93843694684244
not for a kingdom! I think I can see him now, mounted upon his superb	338.31109557542004
animal and seated in his handsome saddle. I am sure he will look like	273.7217496116453
the Great Mogul!”	293.9389458724299
They made a halt for an hour to refresh their horses. Aramis discharged	299.2493092803115
his bill, placed Bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set	283.869412843678
forward to join Porthos.	193.83905020953102
They found him up, less pale than when D’Artagnan left him after his	199.75948922006813
first visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was	254.86447961461306
spread enough for four persons. This dinner consisted of meats nicely	217.37234300124842
dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.	286.9102311174488
“Ah, _pardieu!_” said he, rising, “you come in the nick of time,	292.74043963784436
gentlemen. I was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me.”	221.39428874728645
“Oh, oh!” said D’Artagnan, “Mousqueton has not caught these bottles	252.7571752074758
with his lasso. Besides, here is a piquant _fricandeau_ and a fillet of	188.02622041329332
beef.”	317.55567854694704
“I am recruiting myself,” said Porthos, “I am recruiting myself.	241.4327264924516
Nothing weakens a man more than these devilish strains. Did you ever	343.65169362301555
suffer from a strain, Athos?”	272.7850222290761
“Never! Though I remember, in our affair of the Rue Férou, I received a	180.27947654251446
sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the	320.97152759084724
same effect.”	329.1841377353066
“But this dinner was not intended for you alone, Porthos?” said Aramis.	276.338780629147
“No,” said Porthos, “I expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who	344.95158458131476
have just sent me word they could not come. You will take their places	315.20082860099865
and I shall not lose by the exchange. _Holà_, Mousqueton, seats, and	217.2412035179087
order double the bottles!”	200.9845441596378
“Do you know what we are eating here?” said Athos, at the end of ten	236.97902688176475
minutes.	240.0539220529317
“_Pardieu!_” replied D’Artagnan, “for my part, I am eating veal	175.49589938703954
garnished with shrimps and vegetables.”	290.35017958880127
“And I some lamb chops,” said Porthos.	358.9761020459467
“And I a plain chicken,” said Aramis.	239.81796933985822
“You are all mistaken, gentlemen,” answered Athos, gravely; “you are	363.28629787933426
eating horse.”	217.33248655428207
“Eating what?” said D’Artagnan.	342.3670204336901
“Horse!” said Aramis, with a grimace of disgust.	332.14147681586286
Porthos alone made no reply.	260.6970145743379
“Yes, horse. Are we not eating a horse, Porthos? And perhaps his	348.9189700225087
saddle, therewith.”	175.39178455056685
“No, gentlemen, I have kept the harness,” said Porthos.	348.6199305182183
“My faith,” said Aramis, “we are all alike. One would think we had	266.2329704062528
tipped the wink.”	178.3969757010038
“What could I do?” said Porthos. “This horse made my visitors ashamed	274.7081412199528
of theirs, and I don’t like to humiliate people.”	273.7581348573072
“Then your duchess is still at the waters?” asked D’Artagnan.	303.2596062707786
“Still,” replied Porthos. “And, my faith, the governor of the	253.1188196154243
province—one of the gentlemen I expected today—seemed to have such a	245.72610205603507
wish for him, that I gave him to him.”	349.24003042796573
“Gave him?” cried D’Artagnan.	295.77522936512605
“My God, yes, _gave_, that is the word,” said Porthos; “for the animal	167.44462197343412
was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow	215.75291702177404
would only give me eighty.”	224.7119040693124
“Without the saddle?” said Aramis.	187.33622370933878
“Yes, without the saddle.”	349.5542288906664
“You will observe, gentlemen,” said Athos, “that Porthos has made the	283.5478290404618
best bargain of any of us.”	199.59935590939367
And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the	216.56404606199987
astonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of	209.79132386458517
their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.	275.7748980048353
“There is one comfort, we are all in cash,” said D’Artagnan.	189.6901353507236
“Well, for my part,” said Athos, “I found Aramis’s Spanish wine so good	282.60613584160376
that I sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the	231.83724625993355
lackeys. That has weakened my purse.”	247.02743839609104
“And I,” said Aramis, “imagined that I had given almost my last sou to	352.17798683576234
the church of Montdidier and the Jesuits of Amiens, with whom I had	269.809979774622
made engagements which I ought to have kept. I have ordered Masses for	355.73223941595813
myself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for	280.5710265926841
which I have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited.”	225.95544623177705
“And I,” said Porthos, “do you think my strain cost me nothing?—without	266.67013948437955
reckoning Mousqueton’s wound, for which I had to have the surgeon twice	251.7276879030024
a day, and who charged me double on account of that foolish Mousqueton	175.9378772159459
having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only	300.8309889292449
show to an apothecary; so I advised him to try never to get wounded	234.3078356886491
there any more.”	364.03680947858413
“Ay, ay!” said Athos, exchanging a smile with D’Artagnan and Aramis,	276.7586867260457
“it is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is	184.5653271723946
like a good master.”	223.98908335782363
“In short,” said Porthos, “when all my expenses are paid, I shall have,	355.92166231214276
at most, thirty crowns left.”	304.8016142466768
“And I about ten pistoles,” said Aramis.	343.4697731811149
“Well, then it appears that we are the Crœsuses of the society. How	339.4684557570837
much have you left of your hundred pistoles, D’Artagnan?”	246.07275553590338
“Of my hundred pistoles? Why, in the first place I gave you fifty.”	353.0672893141565
“You think so?”	339.3071115469231
“_Pardieu!_”	335.53679592178946
“Ah, that is true. I recollect.”	170.5492757954074
“Then I paid the host six.”	349.7000488118968
“What a brute of a host! Why did you give him six pistoles?”	194.75870208326913
“You told me to give them to him.”	215.3513550406185
“It is true; I am too good-natured. In brief, how much remains?”	330.3054631430398
“Twenty-five pistoles,” said D’Artagnan.	337.482372206112
“And I,” said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, “I—”	346.39580349065534
“You? Nothing!”	330.7807573688291
“My faith! So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general	328.02185146928196
stock.”	260.1672683676178
“Now, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all.”	216.68172552675014
“Porthos?”	300.3975684578252
“Thirty crowns.”	176.3809465389262
“Aramis?”	199.52236662391354
“Ten pistoles.”	356.13911142562176
“And you, D’Artagnan?”	174.10792485082553
“Twenty-five.”	364.59411196536905
“That makes in all?” said Athos.	215.43458444587873
“Four hundred and seventy-five livres,” said D’Artagnan, who reckoned	357.7876915807351
like Archimedes.	212.57115861722542
“On our arrival in Paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the	201.04875835081805
harnesses,” said Porthos.	335.8156354597355
“But our troop horses?” said Aramis.	312.07463281254263
“Well, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the	361.08664895135644
masters, for which we will draw lots. With the four hundred livres we	236.3747078793288
will make the half of one for one of the unmounted, and then we will	335.39778852925656
give the turnings out of our pockets to D’Artagnan, who has a steady	327.584481380826
hand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to.	250.17190250943108
There!”	218.45514479891636
“Let us dine, then,” said Porthos; “it is getting cold.”	222.84111703879327
The friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the	236.25733290297757
repast, the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton, Bazin,	200.09737062942813
Planchet, and Grimaud.	350.4580724674749
On arriving in Paris, D’Artagnan found a letter from M. de Tréville,	325.3141507627009
which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he	333.11475738932904
should enter the company of the Musketeers.	364.1758515694445
As this was the height of D’Artagnan’s worldly ambition—apart, be it	284.92292513117746
well understood, from his desire of finding Mme. Bonacieux—he ran, full	230.98498790704943
of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour	207.20564259104745
before, but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. They were	300.9938900335959
assembled in council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated	197.59884436980482
an event of some gravity. M. de Tréville had intimated to them his	334.82280308366035
Majesty’s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May, and	297.5952359650629
they must immediately prepare their outfits.	263.67063691156807
The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.	349.65703850162964
M. de Tréville never jested in matters relating to discipline.	191.2170377835498
“And what do you reckon your outfit will cost?” said D’Artagnan.	346.54094150102446
“Oh, we can scarcely say. We have made our calculations with Spartan	177.15947495485423
economy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres.”	331.2152346135214
“Four times fifteen makes sixty—six thousand livres,” said Athos.	233.1554968571694
“It seems to me,” said D’Artagnan, “with a thousand livres each—I do	166.42493303427284
not speak as a Spartan, but as a procurator—”	218.15897977073337
This word _procurator_ roused Porthos. “Stop,” said he, “I have an	352.69701638060405
idea.”	269.7575136075559
“Well, that’s something, for I have not the shadow of one,” said Athos	318.68892720695965
coolly; “but as to D’Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to	339.4846017791896
_ours_ has driven him out of his senses. A thousand livres! For my	205.73546599171254
part, I declare I want two thousand.”	253.3876129459582
“Four times two makes eight,” then said Aramis; “it is eight thousand	236.02772085504142
that we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have	310.5208117162474
already the saddles.”	249.24110564814464
“Besides,” said Athos, waiting till D’Artagnan, who went to thank	231.10883662972003
Monsieur de Tréville, had shut the door, “besides, there is that	317.49712292319214
beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend. What the	231.0329180951142
devil! D’Artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in	364.698414632337
embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger.”	325.4588080335193
Chapter XXIX.	233.08332441546344
HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS	257.51717061406
The most preoccupied of the four friends was certainly D’Artagnan,	182.52690043446444
although he, in his quality of Guardsman, would be much more easily	228.44421890901464
equipped than Messieurs the Musketeers, who were all of high rank; but	183.09386104690404
our Gascon cadet was, as may have been observed, of a provident and	271.1041719349947
almost avaricious character, and with that (explain the contradiction)	186.24806215329372
so vain as almost to rival Porthos. To this preoccupation of his	221.42106963572544
vanity, D’Artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less	190.8608047984407
selfish. Notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting Mme. Bonacieux,	288.57807610994763
he could obtain no intelligence of her. M. de Tréville had spoken of	334.6626721044704
her to the queen. The queen was ignorant where the mercer’s young wife	179.69425861612962
was, but had promised to have her sought for; but this promise was very	252.345259640376
vague and did not at all reassure D’Artagnan.	305.1810661685969
Athos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a	192.39370438783305
single step to equip himself.	313.88616573472444
“We have still fifteen days before us,” said he to his friends, “well,	249.1965968434979
if at the end of a fortnight I have found nothing, or rather if nothing	239.2121173571188
has come to find me, as I, too good a Catholic to kill myself with a	228.08552022443675
pistol bullet, I will seek a good quarrel with four of his Eminence’s	353.56828675304916
Guards or with eight Englishmen, and I will fight until one of them has	215.36849734149393
killed me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. It	183.77335653193322
will then be said of me that I died for the king; so that I shall have	290.8327841557449
performed my duty without the expense of an outfit.”	217.9748676659461
Porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his	265.6130781591089
head and repeating, “I shall follow up on my idea.”	274.88106158088436
Aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.	172.2596353278758
It may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in	172.74677775075597
the community.	255.26040581702182
The lackeys on their part, like the coursers of Hippolytus, shared the	239.54467182845025
sadness of their masters. Mousqueton collected a store of crusts;	317.0216177443947
Bazin, who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the	175.95501830120006
churches; Planchet watched the flight of flies; and Grimaud, whom the	292.61643773763467
general distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his	282.846197664823
master, heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.	362.5433405381066
The three friends—for, as we have said, Athos had sworn not to stir a	354.20838697294425
foot to equip himself—went out early in the morning, and returned late	241.04916512595753
at night. They wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as	264.44110689097795
if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. They	344.7554427127592
might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they	283.86829461616423
wherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one	236.91662597131034
another, as much as to say, “Have you found anything?”	263.72970489584065
However, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it	254.0147423028999
earnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of	363.0866514820518
execution, this worthy Porthos. D’Artagnan perceived him one day	277.08133230125816
walking toward the church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively.	257.43449069015713
He entered, after having twisted his mustache and elongated his	242.28009900450013
imperial, which always announced on his part the most triumphant	267.92734831705707
resolutions. As D’Artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself,	219.42596280192603
Porthos believed he had not been seen. D’Artagnan entered behind him.	332.055348447802
Porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar. D’Artagnan, still	201.63625465717837
unperceived, supported himself against the other side.	308.22248037486366
There happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of	290.0033643920974
people. Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women.	226.16703448011637
Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing	211.51833758646453
the distress of the interior. His hat was a little napless, his feather	319.77513831406077
was a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces	260.30767809323845
were a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things	240.63583286401888
were not seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos.	201.6771967882551
D’Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which	223.11621424214746
Porthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry,	343.5285534822814
but erect and haughty under her black hood. The eyes of Porthos were	357.3600782313081
furtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the	236.9217038704456
nave.	266.1172621892436
On her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the	307.2814278713762
rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then	214.3919093593766
immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously. It was plain that	212.2580259427283
this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit	270.39062931110726
her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not	248.66211590458244
sit still in her seat.	208.33634295463278
Porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a	207.97704521769504
second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near	357.77197804886066
the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no	351.83265128306056
doubt, a great lady—for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought	330.62897387328746
the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the	309.18538284908465
emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the	319.8403979030063
Mass.	289.1488784039419
The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the	316.4239940143066
looks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the	310.1080830078805
velvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant.	354.15006742135813
During this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible	320.32727348588395
motions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating	218.33773440455772
smiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.	278.8387943468816
Then she cried, “Ahem!” under cover of the _mea culpa_, striking her	289.43371978659434
breast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red	331.3646015215928
cushion, turned round toward her. Porthos paid no attention.	284.15764113399797
Nevertheless, he understood it all, but was deaf.	311.7553959503441
The lady with the red cushion produced a great effect—for she was very	293.3590550363422
handsome—upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival	353.96628410044127
really to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her much	362.4413420597167
prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon	259.83998763413746
D’Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of	301.25227699621314
Dover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the	173.07719623932232
name of Milady.	350.6629681196097
D’Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion,	249.99510278429057
continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him	334.4961117612175
greatly. He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the	329.3102129929369
procurator’s wife of the Rue aux Ours, which was the more probable from	320.02684469486655
the church of St. Leu being not far from that locality.	322.9422856411799
He guessed, likewise, by induction, that Porthos was taking his revenge	265.38788877767627
for the defeat of Chantilly, when the procurator’s wife had proved so	283.10271241376716
refractory with respect to her purse.	257.4933399153533
Amid all this, D’Artagnan remarked also that not one countenance	354.2518337369987
responded to the gallantries of Porthos. There were only chimeras and	270.34208644699834
illusions; but for real love, for true jealousy, is there any reality	220.06932449723755
except illusions and chimeras?	180.4543239746903
The sermon over, the procurator’s wife advanced toward the holy font.	194.75344442874538
Porthos went before her, and instead of a finger, dipped his whole hand	347.3374644123248
in. The procurator’s wife smiled, thinking that it was for her Porthos	229.80694932391913
had put himself to this trouble; but she was cruelly and promptly	289.7456189090814
undeceived. When she was only about three steps from him, he turned his	248.5024575327065
head round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red	249.0880394176482
cushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy	208.93038392466644
and her woman.	364.0341001040408
When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew	283.22807463002124
his dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great	295.19331642827876
hand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the	350.3428715491709
cross, and left the church.	238.50101811529447
This was too much for the procurator’s wife; she doubted not there was	339.96690130862703
an intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady	192.69044475916837
she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator’s wife, she	262.9632460322333
contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, “Eh,	339.2349200052971
Monsieur Porthos, you don’t offer me any holy water?”	360.51419225361605
Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a	166.89687068340947
sleep of a hundred years.	299.5269006351425
“Ma-madame!” cried he; “is that you? How is your husband, our dear	196.40628921638066
Monsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes	241.25132656793394
have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?”	333.3505523179734
“I was within two paces of you, monsieur,” replied the procurator’s	311.84489644677427
wife; “but you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the	179.38267570230124
pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.”	286.9403030277135
Porthos pretended to be confused. “Ah,” said he, “you have remarked—”	334.2668302183772
“I must have been blind not to have seen.”	188.78426413770666
“Yes,” said Porthos, “that is a duchess of my acquaintance whom I have	305.7479696956701
great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and	283.6365184204224
who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried	230.75574952664445
in this vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me.”	349.7562971112085
“Monsieur Porthos,” said the procurator’s wife, “will you have the	341.01387851561265
kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes? I have something to say	211.55501494927353
to you.”	190.3811644746096
“Certainly, madame,” said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler	204.62655217798374
does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck.	184.35718603395065
At that moment D’Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a	249.7863907979277
passing glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look.	170.13825234713735
“Eh, eh!” said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy	219.36839945093314
morality of that gallant period, “there is one who will be equipped in	249.09663537956362
good time!”	307.30454833249553
Porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator’s wife,	258.2191436897958
as a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire—a	260.8066120121359
little-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. In	356.1542650102309
the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their	268.59461327249227
crusts, and children at play.	194.41220533822798
“Ah, Monsieur Porthos,” cried the procurator’s wife, when she was	288.31074837469237
assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the	310.84121258146223
locality could either see or hear her, “ah, Monsieur Porthos, you are a	328.9255139572166
great conqueror, as it appears!”	214.30287424737077
“I, madame?” said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; “how so?”	188.7259442610066
“The signs just now, and the holy water! But that must be a princess,	244.07914840977665
at least—that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!”	267.34930295949437
“My God! Madame, you are deceived,” said Porthos; “she is simply a	183.01799538207067
duchess.”	180.96030267604473
“And that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage	305.62692853440353
with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?”	177.20252136007895
Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye	286.59245829985116
of a jealous woman, Mme. Coquenard had seen everything.	339.5905825053875
Porthos regretted that he had not at once made the lady of the red	281.5272150234232
cushion a princess.	170.59282613815014
“Ah, you are quite the pet of the ladies, Monsieur Porthos!” resumed	318.64438888548005
the procurator’s wife, with a sigh.	312.4005455768128
“Well,” responded Porthos, “you may imagine, with the physique with	308.02057201910367
which nature has endowed me, I am not in want of good luck.”	273.7022281825906
“Good Lord, how quickly men forget!” cried the procurator’s wife,	292.2902578250629
raising her eyes toward heaven.	241.74673752699994
“Less quickly than the women, it seems to me,” replied Porthos; “for I,	346.6148951571601
madame, I may say I was your victim, when wounded, dying, I was	263.13773270664853
abandoned by the surgeons. I, the offspring of a noble family, who	235.75513665711506
placed reliance upon your friendship—I was near dying of my wounds at	259.26563826241426
first, and of hunger afterward, in a beggarly inn at Chantilly, without	188.11204999328618
you ever deigning once to reply to the burning letters I addressed to	208.8472118289815
you.”	202.50262127368026
“But, Monsieur Porthos,” murmured the procurator’s wife, who began to	284.3885794877116
feel that, to judge by the conduct of the great ladies of the time, she	268.4710098228445
was wrong.	202.58686069495934
“I, who had sacrificed for you the Baronne de—”	244.53364404617574
“I know it well.”	254.48955164999475
“The Comtesse de—”	291.5112014233831
“Monsieur Porthos, be generous!”	273.0923081274161
“You are right, madame, and I will not finish.”	192.2249689982373
“But it was my husband who would not hear of lending.”	337.53169044430774
“Madame Coquenard,” said Porthos, “remember the first letter you wrote	185.69218367516862
me, and which I preserve engraved in my memory.”	173.22278062957395
The procurator’s wife uttered a groan.	301.50764057466574
“Besides,” said she, “the sum you required me to borrow was rather	210.08250927336147
large.”	312.48572728029137
“Madame Coquenard, I gave you the preference. I had but to write to the	310.4350319648134
Duchesse—but I won’t repeat her name, for I am incapable of	169.96895518282852
compromising a woman; but this I know, that I had but to write to her	325.14027007048134
and she would have sent me fifteen hundred.”	190.81635739790477
The procurator’s wife shed a tear.	274.55424837551607
“Monsieur Porthos,” said she, “I can assure you that you have severely	327.17856312077123
punished me; and if in the time to come you should find yourself in a	182.39848418579248
similar situation, you have but to apply to me.”	196.99343276091562
“Fie, madame, fie!” said Porthos, as if disgusted. “Let us not talk	275.023271036194
about money, if you please; it is humiliating.”	249.96143902527828
“Then you no longer love me!” said the procurator’s wife, slowly and	169.28684867505856
sadly.	263.12938993835087
Porthos maintained a majestic silence.	269.70549464427575
“And that is the only reply you make? Alas, I understand.”	188.78560664918172
“Think of the offense you have committed toward me, madame! It remains	183.39772505335338
_here!_” said Porthos, placing his hand on his heart, and pressing it	352.6141394834193
strongly.	199.6886693220595
“I will repair it, indeed I will, my dear Porthos.”	282.5022994172929
“Besides, what did I ask of you?” resumed Porthos, with a movement of	333.5476098576354
the shoulders full of good fellowship. “A loan, nothing more! After	353.10870407836467
all, I am not an unreasonable man. I know you are not rich, Madame	297.81949519184565
Coquenard, and that your husband is obliged to bleed his poor clients	340.3555737744957
to squeeze a few paltry crowns from them. Oh! If you were a duchess, a	185.5925991532937
marchioness, or a countess, it would be quite a different thing; it	358.5094070411518
would be unpardonable.”	186.78278657265952
The procurator’s wife was piqued.	218.07145802478544
“Please to know, Monsieur Porthos,” said she, “that my strongbox, the	341.9464550327533
strongbox of a procurator’s wife though it may be, is better filled	216.66639018630417
than those of your affected minxes.”	242.9904634771321
“That doubles the offense,” said Porthos, disengaging his arm from that	295.1224715080956
of the procurator’s wife; “for if you are rich, Madame Coquenard, then	365.1061929534676
there is no excuse for your refusal.”	295.90335358221375
“When I said rich,” replied the procurator’s wife, who saw that she had	260.7706119400725
gone too far, “you must not take the word literally. I am not precisely	259.7773629125185
rich, though I am pretty well off.”	209.1031489192662
“Hold, madame,” said Porthos, “let us say no more upon the subject, I	339.69593687194026
beg of you. You have misunderstood me, all sympathy is extinct between	216.3724747432018
us.”	236.76444421803055
“Ingrate that you are!”	174.34661863111822
“Ah! I advise you to complain!” said Porthos.	182.66916502248876
“Begone, then, to your beautiful duchess; I will detain you no longer.”	291.1330026107896
“And she is not to be despised, in my opinion.”	177.0708209337254
“Now, Monsieur Porthos, once more, and this is the last! Do you love me	291.3070198398953
still?”	230.96415394562155
“Ah, madame,” said Porthos, in the most melancholy tone he could	294.9486768555041
assume, “when we are about to enter upon a campaign—a campaign, in	274.80813284653806
which my presentiments tell me I shall be killed—”	243.692595767256
“Oh, don’t talk of such things!” cried the procurator’s wife, bursting	203.95807970030666
into tears.	247.20727089303878
“Something whispers me so,” continued Porthos, becoming more and more	177.06064143321902
melancholy.	328.84192397481877
“Rather say that you have a new love.”	247.3844927459994
“Not so; I speak frankly to you. No object affects me; and I even feel	327.06676140259117
here, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks for you. But in	196.6887997019724
fifteen days, as you know, or as you do not know, this fatal campaign	245.3863846307991
is to open. I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit. Then I	310.2147384024064
must make a journey to see my family, in the lower part of Brittany, to	173.6048704285853
obtain the sum necessary for my departure.”	228.66055363328744
Porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice.	354.5565693029106
“And as,” continued he, “the duchess whom you saw at the church has	258.02417747030023
estates near to those of my family, we mean to make the journey	176.28922237220883
together. Journeys, you know, appear much shorter when we travel two in	256.69737186575776
company.”	181.81014988638054
“Have you no friends in Paris, then, Monsieur Porthos?” said the	305.88299084297967
procurator’s wife.	226.61208847159463
“I thought I had,” said Porthos, resuming his melancholy air; “but I	268.6769879421688
have been taught my mistake.”	301.3845248023625
“You have some!” cried the procurator’s wife, in a transport that	212.15332838326074
surprised even herself. “Come to our house tomorrow. You are the son of	346.92499602765247
my aunt, consequently my cousin; you come from Noyon, in Picardy; you	264.58687054007834
have several lawsuits and no attorney. Can you recollect all that?”	174.32555402891407
“Perfectly, madame.”	191.16037927698463
“Come at dinnertime.”	318.5571993605896
“Very well.”	332.7376592416166
“And be upon your guard before my husband, who is rather shrewd,	287.677296095001
notwithstanding his seventy-six years.”	344.21002299537656
“Seventy-six years! _Peste!_ That’s a fine age!” replied Porthos.	176.63264279291326
“A great age, you mean, Monsieur Porthos. Yes, the poor man may be	264.25936538581385
expected to leave me a widow, any hour,” continued she, throwing a	211.34295204710057
significant glance at Porthos. “Fortunately, by our marriage contract,	247.6791193120372
the survivor takes everything.”	224.06387435531695
“All?”	248.5622698689159
“Yes, all.”	175.6704532368252
“You are a woman of precaution, I see, my dear Madame Coquenard,” said	311.11751659808647
Porthos, squeezing the hand of the procurator’s wife tenderly.	233.86772983268065
“We are then reconciled, dear Monsieur Porthos?” said she, simpering.	197.35077256568056
“For life,” replied Porthos, in the same manner.	269.2844847081088
“Till we meet again, then, dear traitor!”	271.0751925417949
“Till we meet again, my forgetful charmer!”	223.87632004817735
“Tomorrow, my angel!”	318.0971769256621
“Tomorrow, flame of my life!”	241.02058831250417
Chapter XXX.	267.2156555982583
D’ARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN	186.92193149730005
D’Artagnan followed Milady without being perceived by her. He saw her	242.49157687370615
get into her carriage, and heard her order the coachman to drive to St.	254.23048192756397
Germain.	171.73881343235772
It was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two	206.71606459012742
powerful horses. D’Artagnan therefore returned to the Rue Férou.	256.4620003168473
In the Rue de Seine he met Planchet, who had stopped before the house	198.28254121752127
of a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most	229.26045838193915
appetizing appearance.	305.17610611180714
He ordered him to go and saddle two horses in M. de Tréville’s	364.6846311288191
stables—one for himself, D’Artagnan, and one for Planchet—and bring	202.02685606611553
them to Athos’s place. Once for all, Tréville had placed his stable at	176.68743865476478
D’Artagnan’s service.	309.51066487290683
Planchet proceeded toward the Rue du Colombier, and D’Artagnan toward	198.8458720405196
the Rue Férou. Athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous	185.91137349672977
Spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into	346.0415371189034
Picardy. He made a sign for Grimaud to bring a glass for D’Artagnan,	263.3893139491043
and Grimaud obeyed as usual.	255.7782291995461
D’Artagnan related to Athos all that had passed at the church between	336.4444700495877
Porthos and the procurator’s wife, and how their comrade was probably	167.89403966653063
by that time in a fair way to be equipped.	287.19244436601673
“As for me,” replied Athos to this recital, “I am quite at my ease; it	324.6792421137642
will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit.”	288.71440291739367
“Handsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear Athos, neither	180.14019374619176
princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations.”	176.70787607227263
“How young this D’Artagnan is!” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders;	176.38237425606917
and he made a sign to Grimaud to bring another bottle.	268.69725753704444
At that moment Planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,	282.7755880478362
and told his master that the horses were ready.	347.8051760009556
“What horses?” asked Athos.	237.00450910721267
“Two horses that Monsieur de Tréville lends me at my pleasure, and with	212.86439624366707
which I am now going to take a ride to St. Germain.”	176.59617794534475
“Well, and what are you going to do at St. Germain?” then demanded	181.22021079903948
Athos.	199.18772378529349
Then D’Artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church, and	217.5564173451825
how he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak	223.99463904592744
and with the scar near his temple, filled his mind constantly.	252.98817199125358
“That is to say, you are in love with this lady as you were with Madame	308.45268890003575
Bonacieux,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, as if	298.2800342331947
he pitied human weakness.	347.8553721457987
“I? not at all!” said D’Artagnan. “I am only curious to unravel the	357.10812696972323
mystery to which she is attached. I do not know why, but I imagine that	291.71273255340884
this woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her	331.32667035110126
as I am, has an influence over my life.”	208.30785146872716
“Well, perhaps you are right,” said Athos. “I do not know a woman that	340.91388533625684
is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. Madame	303.46990703847143
Bonacieux is lost; so much the worse for her if she is found.”	295.834738025857
“No, Athos, no, you are mistaken,” said D’Artagnan; “I love my poor	233.90478955817366
Constance more than ever, and if I knew the place in which she is, were	240.84864227161768
it at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of	312.1349181879101
her enemies; but I am ignorant. All my researches have been useless.	278.68551912573196
What is to be said? I must divert my attention!”	290.9030430306992
“Amuse yourself with Milady, my dear D’Artagnan; I wish you may with	315.22737233198876
all my heart, if that will amuse you.”	181.34300132351052
“Hear me, Athos,” said D’Artagnan. “Instead of shutting yourself up	285.945984897873
here as if you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a	304.89783937213383
ride with me to St. Germain.”	297.23400111127773
“My dear fellow,” said Athos, “I ride horses when I have any; when I	263.4189831516263
have none, I go afoot.”	224.9372298375061
“Well,” said D’Artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of Athos, which	227.10100369409207
from any other person would have offended him, “I ride what I can get;	305.93276203322034
I am not so proud as you. So _au revoir_, dear Athos.”	272.0978034739593
“_Au revoir_,” said the Musketeer, making a sign to Grimaud to uncork	213.11507875132264
the bottle he had just brought.	236.1410468271013
D’Artagnan and Planchet mounted, and took the road to St. Germain.	229.86606221189876
All along the road, what Athos had said respecting Mme. Bonacieux	237.74452853382064
recurred to the mind of the young man. Although D’Artagnan was not of a	357.86163530669114
very sentimental character, the mercer’s pretty wife had made a real	274.67504455901644
impression upon his heart. As he said, he was ready to go to the end of	220.48842948160748
the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so	260.1891802672983
that he did not know which way to turn. Meantime, he was going to try	191.4212444016304
to find out Milady. Milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak;	227.3418437884654
therefore she knew him. Now, in the opinion of D’Artagnan, it was	244.79866833242033
certainly the man in the black cloak who had carried off Mme. Bonacieux	194.77465514672105
the second time, as he had carried her off the first. D’Artagnan then	329.12163790013926
only half-lied, which is lying but little, when he said that by going	245.87481843968223
in search of Milady he at the same time went in search of Constance.	242.40790089614427
Thinking of all this, and from time to time giving a touch of the spur	236.24220505299954
to his horse, D’Artagnan completed his short journey, and arrived at	304.7768019522392
St. Germain. He had just passed by the pavilion in which ten years	173.36546230117133
later Louis XIV. was born. He rode up a very quiet street, looking to	213.11883492308868
the right and the left to see if he could catch any vestige of his	304.16915799174024
beautiful Englishwoman, when from the ground floor of a pretty house,	322.2678810299275
which, according to the fashion of the time, had no window toward the	187.51525445288505
street, he saw a face peep out with which he thought he was acquainted.	166.68092144323344
This person walked along the terrace, which was ornamented with	359.5483311916407
flowers. Planchet recognized him first.	265.87056188459144
“Eh, monsieur!” said he, addressing D’Artagnan, “don’t you remember	323.49724068028996
that face which is blinking yonder?”	363.79211396319744
“No,” said D’Artagnan, “and yet I am certain it is not the first time I	289.48785975420407
have seen that visage.”	177.5114114010864
“_Parbleu_, I believe it is not,” said Planchet. “Why, it is poor	301.2728151801096
Lubin, the lackey of the Comte de Wardes—he whom you took such good	319.34021619597183
care of a month ago at Calais, on the road to the governor’s country	333.94036737673173
house!”	259.4485497758948
“So it is!” said D’Artagnan; “I know him now. Do you think he would	232.69546785876005
recollect you?”	270.7944127207717
“My faith, monsieur, he was in such trouble that I doubt if he can have	245.25739426842222
retained a very clear recollection of me.”	360.5687240385736
“Well, go and talk with the boy,” said D’Artagnan, “and make out if you	341.05409579259674
can from his conversation whether his master is dead.”	228.06789713354271
Planchet dismounted and went straight up to Lubin, who did not at all	256.4278132112401
remember him, and the two lackeys began to chat with the best	197.2933526715152
understanding possible; while D’Artagnan turned the two horses into a	249.94737596400898
lane, went round the house, and came back to watch the conference from	220.81274602654884
behind a hedge of filberts.	303.95380152522023
At the end of an instant’s observation he heard the noise of a vehicle,	245.69891673370387
and saw Milady’s carriage stop opposite to him. He could not be	362.3413731362348
mistaken; Milady was in it. D’Artagnan leaned upon the neck of his	222.31121685901252
horse, in order that he might see without being seen.	207.50633292648166
Milady put her charming blond head out at the window, and gave her	333.64450661672026
orders to her maid.	347.8752561498286
The latter—a pretty girl of about twenty or twenty-two years, active	346.4658449957655
and lively, the true _soubrette_ of a great lady—jumped from the step	188.99826829296538
upon which, according to the custom of the time, she was seated, and	262.1534697359142
took her way toward the terrace upon which D’Artagnan had perceived	365.6571429339575
Lubin.	173.5365238026468
D’Artagnan followed the _soubrette_ with his eyes, and saw her go	261.5920438820907
toward the terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called	352.3789998330061
Lubin, so that Planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for	362.50057293115407
the road where D’Artagnan had disappeared.	355.37618979634755
The maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out	222.55660747609159
a little billet to him said, “For your master.”	296.8848958079446
“For my master?” replied Planchet, astonished.	318.37952418898004
“Yes, and important. Take it quickly.”	276.6782292760256
Thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward	168.90963096759754
the way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off.	258.7393592388252
Planchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive	332.7650071497817
obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at	296.86562115869924
the end of twenty paces met D’Artagnan, who, having seen all, was	274.60156512105226
coming to him.	214.02179797664684
“For you, monsieur,” said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young	204.33921153140648
man.	247.8901630787949
“For me?” said D’Artagnan; “are you sure of that?”	357.4292626857219
“_Pardieu_, monsieur, I can’t be more sure. The _soubrette_ said, ‘For	204.41074532124097
your master.’ I have no other master but you; so—a pretty little lass,	330.73507138138064
my faith, is that _soubrette!_”	210.46344046557653
D’Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words:	261.18466723126437
“A person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess	348.1464499677689
wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest?	260.78381435734286
Tomorrow, at the Hôtel Field of the Cloth of Gold, a lackey in black	344.3732024135975
and red will wait for your reply.”	189.7173347256558
“Oh!” said D’Artagnan, “this is rather warm; it appears that Milady and	231.0448470398005
I are anxious about the health of the same person. Well, Planchet, how	297.1235611938181
is the good Monsieur de Wardes? He is not dead, then?”	360.04991909370506
“No, monsieur, he is as well as a man can be with four sword wounds in	172.29351771146068
his body; for you, without question, inflicted four upon the dear	207.4145046034168
gentleman, and he is still very weak, having lost almost all his blood.	208.19351283258413
As I said, monsieur, Lubin did not know me, and told me our adventure	255.08129823224306
from one end to the other.”	193.80647646644462
“Well done, Planchet! you are the king of lackeys. Now jump onto your	215.003952450387
horse, and let us overtake the carriage.”	172.8365145306019
This did not take long. At the end of five minutes they perceived the	323.7508831256607
carriage drawn up by the roadside; a cavalier, richly dressed, was	228.32825596702386
close to the door.	350.602426108289
The conversation between Milady and the cavalier was so animated that	273.70523414271946
D’Artagnan stopped on the other side of the carriage without anyone but	265.3007195603961
the pretty _soubrette_ perceiving his presence.	170.87729081876978
The conversation took place in English—a language which D’Artagnan	294.62975622021673
could not understand; but by the accent the young man plainly saw that	312.86170045508686
the beautiful Englishwoman was in a great rage. She terminated it by an	232.01820258722233
action which left no doubt as to the nature of this conversation; this	308.17578249059704
was a blow with her fan, applied with such force that the little	307.8373886433527
feminine weapon flew into a thousand pieces.	260.72543804904547
The cavalier laughed aloud, which appeared to exasperate Milady still	252.52152428728812
more.	167.78065755889165
D’Artagnan thought this was the moment to interfere. He approached the	214.51834314691354
other door, and taking off his hat respectfully, said, “Madame, will	194.48312972258154
you permit me to offer you my services? It appears to me that this	291.4537277773994
cavalier has made you very angry. Speak one word, madame, and I take	270.9713344971951
upon myself to punish him for his want of courtesy.”	324.5963355896113
At the first word Milady turned, looking at the young man with	234.71954457909789
astonishment; and when he had finished, she said in very good French,	239.98646192616508
“Monsieur, I should with great confidence place myself under your	322.1729505331725
protection if the person with whom I quarrel were not my brother.”	308.7587415487196
“Ah, excuse me, then,” said D’Artagnan. “You must be aware that I was	274.6283591180964
ignorant of that, madame.”	247.4254098736335
“What is that stupid fellow troubling himself about?” cried the	298.68734667997035
cavalier whom Milady had designated as her brother, stooping down to	230.58174347164334
the height of the coach window. “Why does not he go about his	274.10007840772573
business?”	217.57377222879137
“Stupid fellow yourself!” said D’Artagnan, stooping in his turn on the	203.08190619950074
neck of his horse, and answering on his side through the carriage	194.836150364527
window. “I do not go on because it pleases me to stop here.”	274.03969072136
The cavalier addressed some words in English to his sister.	177.20690930856378
“I speak to you in French,” said D’Artagnan; “be kind enough, then, to	216.65086767065534
reply to me in the same language. You are Madame’s brother, I learn—be	202.55067972970713
it so; but fortunately you are not mine.”	339.85039244423194
It might be thought that Milady, timid as women are in general, would	222.84850926748922
have interposed in this commencement of mutual provocations in order to	272.82033759902583
prevent the quarrel from going too far; but on the contrary, she threw	347.34011353694103
herself back in her carriage, and called out coolly to the coachman,	258.06764463841733
“Go on—home!”	236.96285339797566
The pretty _soubrette_ cast an anxious glance at D’Artagnan, whose good	258.97817850935877
looks seemed to have made an impression on her.	233.91483100362728
The carriage went on, and left the two men facing each other; no	361.33026885763695
material obstacle separated them.	344.34661295818694
The cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but	334.34617844830063
D’Artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by	279.6647550581705
recognizing in him the Englishman of Amiens who had won his horse and	238.91224971624342
had been very near winning his diamond of Athos, caught at his bridle	190.6886801777903
and stopped him.	351.72436473986255
“Well, monsieur,” said he, “you appear to be more stupid than I am, for	250.7142539384452
you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two.”	270.87454896668623
“Ah,” said the Englishman, “is it you, my master? It seems you must	207.91343706469416
always be playing some game or other.”	332.39093608635915
“Yes; and that reminds me that I have a revenge to take. We will see,	203.21427188067935
my dear monsieur, if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a	340.2937868472112
dice box.”	244.86987825517974
“You see plainly that I have no sword,” said the Englishman. “Do you	314.45089984132164
wish to play the braggart with an unarmed man?”	275.1230961259487
“I hope you have a sword at home; but at all events, I have two, and if	186.73110751473442
you like, I will throw with you for one of them.”	196.27266205596038
“Needless,” said the Englishman; “I am well furnished with such	176.74845765537705
playthings.”	297.9667429172546
“Very well, my worthy gentleman,” replied D’Artagnan, “pick out the	295.41332732770263
longest, and come and show it to me this evening.”	214.8932242451521
“Where, if you please?”	270.93559211036654
“Behind the Luxembourg; that’s a charming spot for such amusements as	348.1270775950072
the one I propose to you.”	174.93116580017667
“That will do; I will be there.”	199.9643010222069
“Your hour?”	220.45005643507267
“Six o’clock.”	178.62724270151716
“_A propos_, you have probably one or two friends?”	363.56911125615494
“I have three, who would be honored by joining in the sport with me.”	256.1612777008116
“Three? Marvelous! That falls out oddly! Three is just my number!”	180.90801622651264
“Now, then, who are you?” asked the Englishman.	361.7940774071633
“I am Monsieur d’Artagnan, a Gascon gentleman, serving in the king’s	196.62651343597932
Musketeers. And you?”	359.58875320597724
“I am Lord de Winter, Baron Sheffield.”	200.43762816776967
“Well, then, I am your servant, Monsieur Baron,” said D’Artagnan,	263.2631605418639
“though you have names rather difficult to recollect.” And touching his	210.2256381301473
horse with the spur, he cantered back to Paris. As he was accustomed to	188.28906321287596
do in all cases of any consequence, D’Artagnan went straight to the	251.29359274487027
residence of Athos.	272.05820822502375
He found Athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he	274.96205806275447
said, for his outfit to come and find him. He related to Athos all that	305.3150216639233
had passed, except the letter to M. de Wardes.	304.4928226000645
Athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an Englishman. We	228.78556355358836
might say that was his dream.	197.30939973301642
They immediately sent their lackeys for Porthos and Aramis, and on	350.31328189223996
their arrival made them acquainted with the situation.	357.11048120728844
Porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,	325.59512299591245
springing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.	192.893349843298
Aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in	201.24859230150793
Athos’s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of	331.1965049901446
drawing swords.	193.16825164719796
Athos, by signs, desired Grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.	199.8272871829426
D’Artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we	271.33103476450856
shall hereafter see the execution, and which promised him some	355.32468045802204
agreeable adventure, as might be seen by the smiles which from time to	341.38169635026
time passed over his countenance, whose thoughtfulness they animated.	191.86379713208922
Chapter XXXI.	361.33780187455517
ENGLISH AND FRENCH	313.08335142745796
The hour having come, they went with their four lackeys to a spot	303.1174350101647
behind the Luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats. Athos threw a	333.9297837572534
piece of money to the goatkeeper to withdraw. The lackeys were ordered	235.96624343212096
to act as sentinels.	364.2770017600926
A silent party soon drew near to the same enclosure, entered, and	364.72070838666843
joined the Musketeers. Then, according to foreign custom, the	265.577735067128
presentations took place.	240.00347522572605
The Englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of	355.21430730334333
their adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of	304.62282065963393
annoyance.	207.29546685911527
“But after all,” said Lord de Winter, when the three friends had been	204.20995547217962
named, “we do not know who you are. We cannot fight with such names;	362.531220599708
they are names of shepherds.”	252.14541259243197
“Therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names,” said	185.03433743187492
Athos.	325.32465036169503
“Which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones,” replied	282.7866325094843
the Englishman.	215.98935653686544
“You played very willingly with us without knowing our names,” said	247.26469209438622
Athos, “by the same token that you won our horses.”	264.5656032653107
“That is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk	215.21846469024348
our blood. One plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals.”	296.4608253102127
“And that is but just,” said Athos, and he took aside the one of the	249.2077410059517
four Englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in	305.3291982799646
a low voice.	215.79931913039576
Porthos and Aramis did the same.	185.26286416438816
“Does that satisfy you?” said Athos to his adversary. “Do you find me	216.9627282242296
of sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?”	360.7451004126871
“Yes, monsieur,” said the Englishman, bowing.	246.03929208911734
“Well! now shall I tell you something?” added Athos, coolly.	240.02413955801626
“What?” replied the Englishman.	287.10415286248997
“Why, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not	283.16091540127456
required me to make myself known.”	252.5421616239379
“Why so?”	343.666052089505
“Because I am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody	279.3116653001094
to know I am living; so that I shall be obliged to kill you to prevent	324.33304727185487
my secret from roaming over the fields.”	180.16562946155207
The Englishman looked at Athos, believing that he jested, but Athos did	350.17789035627493
not jest the least in the world.	250.7301084187001
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, addressing at the same time his companions and	241.5962561926746
their adversaries, “are we ready?”	269.0404779971923
“Yes!” answered the Englishmen and the Frenchmen, as with one voice.	230.4462457366746
“On guard, then!” cried Athos.	196.44078664591882
Immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and	258.14616924964844
the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice	338.25304350684814
enemies.	286.0786555793811
Athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been	323.35831034090205
practicing in a fencing school.	215.7377895156921
Porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure	353.53758950381643
of Chantilly, played with skill and prudence. Aramis, who had the third	214.21155844480666
canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.	336.52283477750984
Athos killed his adversary first. He hit him but once, but as he had	209.86661493382627
foretold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.	303.6067917034182
Second, Porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his	339.1056044131266
thigh, As the Englishman, without making any further resistance, then	351.4939815386032
surrendered his sword, Porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to	328.03718676738094
his carriage.	269.42346500062075
Aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty paces, the	298.6806216490087
man ended by fairly taking to his heels, and disappeared amid the	279.87692944348805
hooting of the lackeys.	259.97808118921284
As to D’Artagnan, he fought purely and simply on the defensive; and	292.44097177058217
when he saw his adversary pretty well fatigued, with a vigorous side	362.03448539745625
thrust sent his sword flying. The baron, finding himself disarmed, took	175.95868983182345
two or three steps back, but in this movement his foot slipped and he	244.41709686022244
fell backward.	319.9996442617031
D’Artagnan was over him at a bound, and said to the Englishman,	296.83731769966477
pointing his sword to his throat, “I could kill you, my Lord, you are	213.04682135308224
completely in my hands; but I spare your life for the sake of your	280.3212441882867
sister.”	214.84794301319025
D’Artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had	279.7456577653126
imagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted	218.5064338021963
upon his face.	288.60579778576243
The Englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a	255.93128253168004
kind disposition, pressed D’Artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand	244.7089432718086
compliments to the three Musketeers, and as Porthos’s adversary was	215.81235159169879
already installed in the carriage, and as Aramis’s had taken to his	199.9458798099011
heels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.	176.657557165445
As Porthos and Aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his	253.84493915360247
wound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. D’Artagnan	316.4675138653919
picked it up and offered it to Lord de Winter.	245.834608282045
“What the devil would you have me do with that?” said the Englishman.	360.49537394639844
“You can restore it to his family,” said D’Artagnan.	196.50810830616211
“His family will care much about such a trifle as that! His family will	298.91226387030235
inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him. Keep the purse for your	177.7991896820714
lackeys.”	305.5438817715112
D’Artagnan put the purse into his pocket.	355.278355016682
“And now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you	354.36257765707694
that name,” said Lord de Winter, “on this very evening, if agreeable to	255.40347753040578
you, I will present you to my sister, Milady Clarik, for I am desirous	291.7267891034284
that she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad	182.9715098263976
odor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that	200.30701594093358
will not prove useless to you.”	326.1133798000615
D’Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.	337.5741052235471
At this time Athos came up to D’Artagnan.	228.13041460316808
“What do you mean to do with that purse?” whispered he.	310.3115578057881
“Why, I meant to pass it over to you, my dear Athos.”	290.06097290744924
“Me! why to me?”	176.94211787413008
“Why, you killed him! They are the spoils of victory.”	280.7165656432535
“I, the heir of an enemy!” said Athos; “for whom, then, do you take	201.22889598767756
me?”	218.85174349600584
“It is the custom in war,” said D’Artagnan, “why should it not be the	291.1445385180246
custom in a duel?”	271.0380163294527
“Even on the field of battle, I have never done that.”	177.48967657139426
Porthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips	307.5056097211496
endorsed Athos.	302.64749549433185
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, “let us give the money to the lackeys, as Lord	169.78675692339266
de Winter desired us to do.”	335.8973657376308
“Yes,” said Athos; “let us give the money to the lackeys—not to our	190.9936041464559
lackeys, but to the lackeys of the Englishmen.”	304.23711070980585
Athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. “For	336.02171311397524
you and your comrades.”	286.42614699145065
This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even	172.71231702055678
Porthos; and this French generosity, repeated by Lord de Winter and his	196.7087910870073
friend, was highly applauded, except by MM. Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton	350.62582587806025
and Planchet.	277.35252013359866
Lord de Winter, on quitting D’Artagnan, gave him his sister’s address.	203.46638825551676
She lived in the Place Royale—then the fashionable quarter—at Number 6,	197.2500023309821
and he undertook to call and take D’Artagnan with him in order to	183.08114124468594
introduce him. D’Artagnan appointed eight o’clock at Athos’s residence.	171.5746634975
This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon	325.36112507354306
greatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto	174.13028155496667
been mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was some	293.60167417278
creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn	288.49516052671436
toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His	332.099747355149
only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and	182.5434447344674
of Dover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de	310.8200062836674
Tréville, and consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king;	231.0757888815454
which would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to	190.80082417420252
Milady as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. As to the	200.30772432499734
commencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our	278.74433584898793
presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis	226.25932599107068
was young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal’s favor. It is not	305.1593218598762
for nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at	349.7764104905306
Tarbes.	179.4981869851273
D’Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to	244.4808915912073
Athos’s, and according to custom, related everything to him. Athos	167.10875197920794
listened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence	309.81731594855324
to him with a shade of bitterness.	189.4345579060052
“What!” said he, “you have just lost one woman, whom you call good,	175.71300579820797
charming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another.”	291.4176360208104
D’Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.	301.2040265136851
“I loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with	291.64776318476294
my head,” said he. “In getting introduced to her, my principal object	241.7117875839452
is to ascertain what part she plays at court.”	350.97390127554
“The part she plays, _pardieu!_ It is not difficult to divine that,	234.27429459482317
after all you have told me. She is some emissary of the cardinal; a	321.7786780926242
woman who will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your	353.60893846349234
head.”	227.2180127719945
“The devil! my dear Athos, you view things on the dark side, methinks.”	340.4856474935725
“My dear fellow, I mistrust women. Can it be otherwise? I bought my	183.78623449146198
experience dearly—particularly fair women. Milady is fair, you say?”	246.75132670503828
“She has the most beautiful light hair imaginable!”	234.09690518486514
“Ah, my poor D’Artagnan!” said Athos.	180.3334463181544
“Listen to me! I want to be enlightened on a subject; then, when I	224.5074228594043
shall have learned what I desire to know, I will withdraw.”	307.5017758980103
“Be enlightened!” said Athos, phlegmatically.	300.5122850472781
Lord de Winter arrived at the appointed time; but Athos, being warned	300.51643823559516
of his coming, went into the other chamber. He therefore found	170.07934273942868
D’Artagnan alone, and as it was nearly eight o’clock he took the young	218.3311970672729
man with him.	211.3155526350509
An elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent	291.5489148948298
horses, they were soon at the Place Royale.	169.40995731193522
Milady Clarik received D’Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hôtel was	184.30291914714036
remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit,	206.3221183332597
or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just	173.2183470955961
been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the	312.90427853599147
general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her.	180.9895055642591
“You see,” said Lord de Winter, presenting D’Artagnan to his sister, “a	313.7181836534293
young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not	354.02671211449
abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it	270.00130229962315
was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him,	335.85101777156194
then, madame, if you have any affection for me.”	324.3851276911974
Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow,	293.67794590751936
and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who	233.04729980151706
saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it.	253.03986573443967
The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with	312.71321034217647
Milady’s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.	227.37123359188124
“You are welcome, monsieur,” said Milady, in a voice whose singular	252.084591048986
sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which D’Artagnan	365.2367413174757
had just remarked; “you have today acquired eternal rights to my	293.80481403672815
gratitude.”	363.46616261132453
The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without	178.93522620075115
omitting a single detail. Milady listened with the greatest attention,	273.9493114051763
and yet it was easily to be perceived, whatever effort she made to	264.5192752555925
conceal her impressions, that this recital was not agreeable to her.	364.940145492046
The blood rose to her head, and her little foot worked with impatience	238.8501256242705
beneath her robe.	266.7151439552998
Lord de Winter perceived nothing of this. When he had finished, he went	179.44657256842444
to a table upon which was a salver with Spanish wine and glasses. He	176.29480146346373
filled two glasses, and by a sign invited D’Artagnan to drink.	275.3367535466051
D’Artagnan knew it was considered disobliging by an Englishman to	226.17423183393478
refuse to pledge him. He therefore drew near to the table and took the	315.0889703025348
second glass. He did not, however, lose sight of Milady, and in a	294.92067143445536
mirror he perceived the change that came over her face. Now that she	287.2121798306357
believed herself to be no longer observed, a sentiment resembling	237.59173930953102
ferocity animated her countenance. She bit her handkerchief with her	286.3758781499276
beautiful teeth.	221.9445138615527
That pretty little _soubrette_ whom D’Artagnan had already observed	301.0540910942974
then came in. She spoke some words to Lord de Winter in English, who	259.3802206395424
thereupon requested D’Artagnan’s permission to retire, excusing himself	176.0284394847703
on account of the urgency of the business that had called him away, and	219.66742695482495
charging his sister to obtain his pardon.	271.2531683854659
D’Artagnan exchanged a shake of the hand with Lord de Winter, and then	318.18164924361304
returned to Milady. Her countenance, with surprising mobility, had	352.45048561512203
recovered its gracious expression; but some little red spots on her	309.5224816319536
handkerchief indicated that she had bitten her lips till the blood	287.9482773873807
came. Those lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral.	323.80970222578867
The conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely	302.53524002972995
recovered. She told D’Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her	171.64307622591153
brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother	176.17982198369262
of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was	222.80858926569024
the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All	193.0748273146194
this showed D’Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something;	354.67764017222964
but he could not yet see under this veil.	255.86322561894423
In addition to this, after a half hour’s conversation D’Artagnan was	353.41816679623906
convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an	256.6245960412576
elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head.	321.1372247687727
D’Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of	311.51156899896046
devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady	263.83860020800495
replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire.	356.71510975113966
D’Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of	171.17321023414746
men.	197.17962369869673
On the staircase he met the pretty _soubrette_, who brushed gently	183.0162923787979
against him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his	299.1311515677571
pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was	238.63024143616224
granted instantly.	351.187477496004
D’Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than	322.53861713780725
on the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was	285.4727791720355
Milady who this time did all the honors of the evening. She appeared to	280.024471769891
take a great interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his	337.2851793100342
friends, and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself	343.16378289109156
to the cardinal.	220.8256173363024
D’Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young	337.7813275930644
man of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady. He	331.9176514750973
launched into a eulogy of his Eminence, and said that he should not	191.19967816521915
have failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the	330.98563526553903
king’s Guards if he had happened to know M. de Cavois instead of M. de	276.63478968077965
Tréville.	319.35298168657965
Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation,	343.66140022281974
and asked D’Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had	293.0773488263497
ever been in England.	302.3715919981544
D’Artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by M. de Tréville to	290.22544137023544
treat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as	361.4356628103541
specimens.	333.087391345702
Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips;	246.39020192063953
she had to deal with a Gascon who played close.	301.5128326727778
At the same hour as on the preceding evening, D’Artagnan retired. In	297.13442166511993
the corridor he again met the pretty Kitty; that was the name of the	246.76404616648443
_soubrette_. She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it	186.6124984852947
was impossible to mistake; but D’Artagnan was so preoccupied by the	335.6726997361631
mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.	258.16127322795006
D’Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each	327.61248821269686
day Milady gave him a more gracious reception.	342.21781098415204
Every evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the	182.2182205149173
stairs, he met the pretty _soubrette_. But, as we have said, D’Artagnan	280.2322575150207
paid no attention to this persistence of poor Kitty.	247.15811794968081
Chapter XXXII.	365.0178665973136
A PROCURATOR’S DINNER	176.2491985803293
However brilliant had been the part played by Porthos in the duel, it	200.55472663201667
had not made him forget the dinner of the procurator’s wife.	342.649850687322
On the morrow he received the last touches of Mousqueton’s brush for an	213.10906197763268
hour, and took his way toward the Rue aux Ours with the steps of a man	282.6307857960328
who was doubly in favor with fortune.	273.3983450456832
His heart beat, but not like D’Artagnan’s with a young and impatient	232.76872070721038
love. No; a more material interest stirred his blood. He was about at	232.1445453766138
last to pass that mysterious threshold, to climb those unknown stairs	286.3972993794655
by which, one by one, the old crowns of M. Coquenard had ascended. He	221.2408988133074
was about to see in reality a certain coffer of which he had twenty	351.57174755808285
times beheld the image in his dreams—a coffer long and deep, locked,	267.3002853850751
bolted, fastened in the wall; a coffer of which he had so often heard,	322.1661568548666
and which the hands—a little wrinkled, it is true, but still not	201.6855858599564
without elegance—of the procurator’s wife were about to open to his	239.63390287617148
admiring looks.	276.2238066086176
And then he—a wanderer on the earth, a man without fortune, a man	235.1596488761091
without family, a soldier accustomed to inns, cabarets, taverns, and	210.15639023398518
restaurants, a lover of wine forced to depend upon chance treats—was	326.5739179631388
about to partake of family meals, to enjoy the pleasures of a	194.0984836877831
comfortable establishment, and to give himself up to those little	246.1063612922503
attentions which “the harder one is, the more they please,” as old	312.9317283167835
soldiers say.	276.219647619573
To come in the capacity of a cousin, and seat himself every day at a	314.8150824225378
good table; to smooth the yellow, wrinkled brow of the old procurator;	247.3696180966121
to pluck the clerks a little by teaching them _bassette_, _passe-dix_,	266.86684740734097
and _lansquenet_, in their utmost nicety, and winning from them, by way	326.9877443571368
of fee for the lesson he would give them in an hour, their savings of a	178.27263031032913
month—all this was enormously delightful to Porthos.	171.6263215833018
The Musketeer could not forget the evil reports which then prevailed,	242.3314697071715
and which indeed have survived them, of the procurators of the	215.6936569831041
period—meanness, stinginess, fasts; but as, after all, excepting some	336.9360292806365
few acts of economy which Porthos had always found very unseasonable,	224.89910710526777
the procurator’s wife had been tolerably liberal—that is, be it	206.12145221062565
understood, for a procurator’s wife—he hoped to see a household of a	311.2249869355826
highly comfortable kind.	356.7742032973999
And yet, at the very door the Musketeer began to entertain some doubts.	360.2414210140329
The approach was not such as to prepossess people—an ill-smelling, dark	180.85814478500626
passage, a staircase half-lighted by bars through which stole a glimmer	294.0113639832066
from a neighboring yard; on the first floor a low door studded with	350.38705035460055
enormous nails, like the principal gate of the Grand Châtelet.	263.90851077707197
Porthos knocked with his hand. A tall, pale clerk, his face shaded by a	360.97529278004424
forest of virgin hair, opened the door, and bowed with the air of a man	278.96137227443273
forced at once to respect in another lofty stature, which indicated	291.18519917805133
strength, the military dress, which indicated rank, and a ruddy	228.5084542542466
countenance, which indicated familiarity with good living.	205.5773926411915
A shorter clerk came behind the first, a taller clerk behind the	252.93082068154223
second, a stripling of a dozen years rising behind the third. In all,	174.57198864901534
three clerks and a half, which, for the time, argued a very extensive	259.85864239040785
clientage.	334.9227857973658
Although the Musketeer was not expected before one o’clock, the	311.805413455048
procurator’s wife had been on the watch ever since midday, reckoning	239.6737658335445
that the heart, or perhaps the stomach, of her lover would bring him	223.70837135170393
before his time.	325.89671114615203
Mme. Coquenard therefore entered the office from the house at the same	323.3151051973545
moment her guest entered from the stairs, and the appearance of the	188.95175178171843
worthy lady relieved him from an awkward embarrassment. The clerks	178.95385601644975
surveyed him with great curiosity, and he, not knowing well what to say	186.09120270037317
to this ascending and descending scale, remained tongue-tied.	324.96582136445386
“It is my cousin!” cried the procurator’s wife. “Come in, come in,	320.27857668256695
Monsieur Porthos!”	318.98649941345707
The name of Porthos produced its effect upon the clerks, who began to	261.6150566038196
laugh; but Porthos turned sharply round, and every countenance quickly	275.6397414253003
recovered its gravity.	230.08858575653855
They reached the office of the procurator after having passed through	236.88755257610708
the antechamber in which the clerks were, and the study in which they	235.33165584390662
ought to have been. This last apartment was a sort of dark room,	253.7823285926035
littered with papers. On quitting the study they left the kitchen on	321.9860812385607
the right, and entered the reception room.	212.5936279173541
All these rooms, which communicated with one another, did not inspire	199.91266183538266
Porthos favorably. Words might be heard at a distance through all these	313.91643210351435
open doors. Then, while passing, he had cast a rapid, investigating	200.02997381500293
glance into the kitchen; and he was obliged to confess to himself, to	307.4843795135756
the shame of the procurator’s wife and his own regret, that he did not	349.08214966972173
see that fire, that animation, that bustle, which when a good repast is	185.9061838898263
on foot prevails generally in that sanctuary of good living.	208.70789371728316
The procurator had without doubt been warned of his visit, as he	274.7329987541257
expressed no surprise at the sight of Porthos, who advanced toward him	201.51258459319223
with a sufficiently easy air, and saluted him courteously.	230.32737231147848
“We are cousins, it appears, Monsieur Porthos?” said the procurator,	344.83669197425365
rising, yet supporting his weight upon the arms of his cane chair.	201.3127070105009
The old man, wrapped in a large black doublet, in which the whole of	235.68995723953935
his slender body was concealed, was brisk and dry. His little gray eyes	331.79713749707594
shone like carbuncles, and appeared, with his grinning mouth, to be the	216.42542331381156
only part of his face in which life survived. Unfortunately the legs	364.2407596133501
began to refuse their service to this bony machine. During the last	200.54937296760113
five or six months that this weakness had been felt, the worthy	230.9057959420935
procurator had nearly become the slave of his wife.	238.3567286340408
The cousin was received with resignation, that was all. M. Coquenard,	327.1717077094188
firm upon his legs, would have declined all relationship with M.	191.95056332751017
Porthos.	237.1450491877257
“Yes, monsieur, we are cousins,” said Porthos, without being	247.13174111352922
disconcerted, as he had never reckoned upon being received	291.00405467459643
enthusiastically by the husband.	269.30940776227044
“By the female side, I believe?” said the procurator, maliciously.	365.3132010830168
Porthos did not feel the ridicule of this, and took it for a piece of	353.09900542563275
simplicity, at which he laughed in his large mustache. Mme. Coquenard,	231.31113237231546
who knew that a simple-minded procurator was a very rare variety in the	184.69122474618666
species, smiled a little, and colored a great deal.	291.52376181309313
M. Coquenard had, since the arrival of Porthos, frequently cast his	248.86680204839317
eyes with great uneasiness upon a large chest placed in front of his	221.47786034001854
oak desk. Porthos comprehended that this chest, although it did not	252.05812556262214
correspond in shape with that which he had seen in his dreams, must be	249.13954230008423
the blessed coffer, and he congratulated himself that the reality was	236.88225945891122
several feet higher than the dream.	198.99714014342706
M. Coquenard did not carry his genealogical investigations any further;	265.48483074918994
but withdrawing his anxious look from the chest and fixing it upon	221.63785067981416
Porthos, he contented himself with saying, “Monsieur our cousin will do	236.00225353783435
us the favor of dining with us once before his departure for the	266.6718578962162
campaign, will he not, Madame Coquenard?”	348.984563992338
This time Porthos received the blow right in his stomach, and felt it.	213.67336635987556
It appeared likewise that Mme. Coquenard was not less affected by it on	360.12990447851513
her part, for she added, “My cousin will not return if he finds that we	246.98122471858747
do not treat him kindly; but otherwise he has so little time to pass in	321.43289251877565
Paris, and consequently to spare to us, that we must entreat him to	202.5500104252244
give us every instant he can call his own previous to his departure.”	358.6370821864585
“Oh, my legs, my poor legs! where are you?” murmured Coquenard, and he	225.16245596602002
tried to smile.	274.22336785868185
This succor, which came to Porthos at the moment in which he was	275.28501304179906
attacked in his gastronomic hopes, inspired much gratitude in the	354.05403594874997
Musketeer toward the procurator’s wife.	257.3591555110767
The hour of dinner soon arrived. They passed into the eating room—a	229.462638225634
large dark room situated opposite the kitchen.	286.1013487272106
The clerks, who, as it appeared, had smelled unusual perfumes in the	321.10260384538964
house, were of military punctuality, and held their stools in hand	168.82202989037023
quite ready to sit down. Their jaws moved preliminarily with fearful	257.9309827483144
threatenings.	357.13991651281617
“Indeed!” thought Porthos, casting a glance at the three hungry	225.59637211450953
clerks—for the errand boy, as might be expected, was not admitted to	191.71695426929102
the honors of the magisterial table, “in my cousin’s place, I would not	298.78736884187026
keep such gourmands! They look like shipwrecked sailors who have not	214.8932087067408
eaten for six weeks.”	219.86535725454476
M. Coquenard entered, pushed along upon his armchair with casters by	241.43606049047398
Mme. Coquenard, whom Porthos assisted in rolling her husband up to the	173.64020026792704
table. He had scarcely entered when he began to agitate his nose and	256.1727749324494
his jaws after the example of his clerks.	358.34256139885554
“Oh, oh!” said he; “here is a soup which is rather inviting.”	305.5671932090596
“What the devil can they smell so extraordinary in this soup?” said	353.71192208478044
Porthos, at the sight of a pale liquid, abundant but entirely free from	238.84229982241453
meat, on the surface of which a few crusts swam about as rare as the	175.76931801377526
islands of an archipelago.	338.8593636946687
Mme. Coquenard smiled, and upon a sign from her everyone eagerly took	328.05230370726474
his seat.	348.40552053054785
M. Coquenard was served first, then Porthos. Afterward Mme. Coquenard	168.64335607853653
filled her own plate, and distributed the crusts without soup to the	326.78510124011666
impatient clerks. At this moment the door of the dining room unclosed	291.3821249532373
with a creak, and Porthos perceived through the half-open flap the	209.10715281832998
little clerk who, not being allowed to take part in the feast, ate his	296.48414422568106
dry bread in the passage with the double odor of the dining room and	236.72974112718947
kitchen.	167.86586700191796
After the soup the maid brought a boiled fowl—a piece of magnificence	231.6493215853206
which caused the eyes of the diners to dilate in such a manner that	313.87786927098017
they seemed ready to burst.	283.99121687581146
“One may see that you love your family, Madame Coquenard,” said the	235.0585709137116
procurator, with a smile that was almost tragic. “You are certainly	216.89461182353295
treating your cousin very handsomely!”	208.49503353634037
The poor fowl was thin, and covered with one of those thick, bristly	176.67721316389603
skins through which the teeth cannot penetrate with all their efforts.	355.23630261478945
The fowl must have been sought for a long time on the perch, to which	184.8320254368285
it had retired to die of old age.	348.5467308000808
“The devil!” thought Porthos, “this is poor work. I respect old age,	324.7137869310298
but I don’t much like it boiled or roasted.”	222.1982927326332
And he looked round to see if anybody partook of his opinion; but on	259.2452269768831
the contrary, he saw nothing but eager eyes which were devouring, in	323.7617708424608
anticipation, that sublime fowl which was the object of his contempt.	303.12571313895813
Mme. Coquenard drew the dish toward her, skillfully detached the two	230.93106733817217
great black feet, which she placed upon her husband’s plate, cut off	274.5943452699436
the neck, which with the head she put on one side for herself, raised	304.38576947353727
the wing for Porthos, and then returned the bird otherwise intact to	234.7211581339311
the servant who had brought it in, who disappeared with it before the	303.95401901380365
Musketeer had time to examine the variations which disappointment	352.69611408634574
produces upon faces, according to the characters and temperaments of	205.53190304970204
those who experience it.	238.81400733216356
In the place of the fowl a dish of haricot beans made its appearance—an	339.61250483083836
enormous dish in which some bones of mutton that at first sight one	269.40179781431726
might have believed to have some meat on them pretended to show	354.7593025643682
themselves.	197.08710305280638
But the clerks were not the dupes of this deceit, and their lugubrious	191.35726904723305
looks settled down into resigned countenances.	231.58562710984697
Mme. Coquenard distributed this dish to the young men with the	305.67150608450663
moderation of a good housewife.	261.59842910247187
The time for wine came. M. Coquenard poured from a very small stone	280.74740729473575
bottle the third of a glass for each of the young men, served himself	365.15885475137054
in about the same proportion, and passed the bottle to Porthos and Mme.	168.69467440887894
Coquenard.	193.53621766925235
The young men filled up their third of a glass with water; then, when	337.6577797756884
they had drunk half the glass, they filled it up again, and continued	190.6821935622237
to do so. This brought them, by the end of the repast, to swallowing a	204.831219370427
drink which from the color of the ruby had passed to that of a pale	253.68941497914307
topaz.	362.57240234653153
Porthos ate his wing of the fowl timidly, and shuddered when he felt	351.65579817714547
the knee of the procurator’s wife under the table, as it came in search	318.5879252334039
of his. He also drank half a glass of this sparingly served wine, and	273.3111064695306
found it to be nothing but that horrible Montreuil—the terror of all	356.2375550788616
expert palates.	195.48667616399487
M. Coquenard saw him swallowing this wine undiluted, and sighed deeply.	281.21234177663
“Will you eat any of these beans, Cousin Porthos?” said Mme. Coquenard,	298.11748705028447
in that tone which says, “Take my advice, don’t touch them.”	365.9170632322945
“Devil take me if I taste one of them!” murmured Porthos to himself,	294.5381812005746
and then said aloud, “Thank you, my cousin, I am no longer hungry.”	278.1462605734941
There was silence. Porthos could hardly keep his countenance.	200.81933278651684
The procurator repeated several times, “Ah, Madame Coquenard! Accept my	176.25999121615394
compliments; your dinner has been a real feast. Lord, how I have	348.27535510297207
eaten!”	225.97194810340628
M. Coquenard had eaten his soup, the black feet of the fowl, and the	236.6541641683371
only mutton bone on which there was the least appearance of meat.	197.81448750328644
Porthos fancied they were mystifying him, and began to curl his	291.416286946842
mustache and knit his eyebrows; but the knee of Mme. Coquenard gently	317.5439035194306
advised him to be patient.	333.97448198272446
This silence and this interruption in serving, which were	266.219654635001
unintelligible to Porthos, had, on the contrary, a terrible meaning for	201.01318124623964
the clerks. Upon a look from the procurator, accompanied by a smile	192.56955716982873
from Mme. Coquenard, they arose slowly from the table, folded their	355.5688596184044
napkins more slowly still, bowed, and retired.	239.38806992739322
“Go, young men! go and promote digestion by working,” said the	325.80662154635456
procurator, gravely.	352.9464722446825
The clerks gone, Mme. Coquenard rose and took from a buffet a piece of	302.7023389455701
cheese, some preserved quinces, and a cake which she had herself made	282.414544809666
of almonds and honey.	280.46310279942713
M. Coquenard knit his eyebrows because there were too many good things.	249.20027520860984
Porthos bit his lips because he saw not the wherewithal to dine. He	183.2941934707881
looked to see if the dish of beans was still there; the dish of beans	229.71232453695507
had disappeared.	225.00650227403224
“A positive feast!” cried M. Coquenard, turning about in his chair, “a	269.4604759909156
real feast, _epulœ epulorum_. Lucullus dines with Lucullus.”	220.44022966107588
Porthos looked at the bottle, which was near him, and hoped that with	335.07538254148983
wine, bread, and cheese, he might make a dinner; but wine was wanting,	252.809691249879
the bottle was empty. M. and Mme. Coquenard did not seem to observe it.	358.14307129823953
“This is fine!” said Porthos to himself; “I am prettily caught!”	245.1850622486918
He passed his tongue over a spoonful of preserves, and stuck his teeth	253.21484400209883
into the sticky pastry of Mme. Coquenard.	248.11981217247876
“Now,” said he, “the sacrifice is consummated! Ah! if I had not the	284.6133423699615
hope of peeping with Madame Coquenard into her husband’s chest!”	338.78697978020926
M. Coquenard, after the luxuries of such a repast, which he called an	263.24410612054737
excess, felt the want of a siesta. Porthos began to hope that the thing	179.62116476371196
would take place at the present sitting, and in that same locality; but	231.18781931811486
the procurator would listen to nothing, he would be taken to his room,	343.03128173532826
and was not satisfied till he was close to his chest, upon the edge of	318.595489656575
which, for still greater precaution, he placed his feet.	213.55459636086857
The procurator’s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they	327.36974708413777
began to lay the basis of a reconciliation.	245.4718911280508
“You can come and dine three times a week,” said Mme. Coquenard.	213.8259855847911
“Thanks, madame!” said Porthos, “but I don’t like to abuse your	279.2311980275253
kindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!”	195.68829694392974
“That’s true,” said the procurator’s wife, groaning, “that unfortunate	292.856715801454
outfit!”	228.80010617364655
“Alas, yes,” said Porthos, “it is so.”	320.02770719985904
“But of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist,	263.9944268772591
Monsieur Porthos?”	273.8821159700663
“Oh, of many things!” said Porthos. “The Musketeers are, as you know,	347.8447539413895
picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen	223.6342101541612
or the Swiss.”	316.61022898291344
“But yet, detail them to me.”	322.516781163397
“Why, they may amount to—“, said Porthos, who preferred discussing the	169.68735775500343
total to taking them one by one.	282.15181195236096
The procurator’s wife waited tremblingly.	308.433654437903
“To how much?” said she. “I hope it does not exceed—” She stopped;	188.73002556062954
speech failed her.	336.0469226168582
“Oh, no,” said Porthos, “it does not exceed two thousand five hundred	357.18522647499844
livres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two	238.62621144634426
thousand livres.”	198.3823225097865
“Good God!” cried she, “two thousand livres! Why, that is a fortune!”	320.62343437199877
Porthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it.	205.08509509423658
“I wished to know the detail,” said she, “because, having many	210.69322690397698
relatives in business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a	233.8089720846067
hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself.”	225.58363960141423
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “that is what you meant to say!”	186.72572565326945
“Yes, dear Monsieur Porthos. Thus, for instance, don’t you in the first	309.636216134081
place want a horse?”	234.60046497408098
“Yes, a horse.”	187.54064377008444
“Well, then! I can just suit you.”	223.0497150836791
“Ah!” said Porthos, brightening, “that’s well as regards my horse; but	312.8954806728318
I must have the appointments complete, as they include objects which a	365.7258491519999
Musketeer alone can purchase, and which will not amount, besides, to	303.6898404514569
more than three hundred livres.”	185.46793674203482
“Three hundred livres? Then put down three hundred livres,” said the	321.19679018017416
procurator’s wife, with a sigh.	347.4533760883197
Porthos smiled. It may be remembered that he had the saddle which came	305.88282849235014
from Buckingham. These three hundred livres he reckoned upon putting	364.84573880825843
snugly into his pocket.	237.00360155102638
“Then,” continued he, “there is a horse for my lackey, and my valise.	245.3312952945939
As to my arms, it is useless to trouble you about them; I have them.”	350.89196034307724
“A horse for your lackey?” resumed the procurator’s wife, hesitatingly;	348.55594830058
“but that is doing things in lordly style, my friend.”	209.70290735091834
“Ah, madame!” said Porthos, haughtily; “do you take me for a beggar?”	291.0427508892289
“No; I only thought that a pretty mule makes sometimes as good an	243.16670803999284
appearance as a horse, and it seemed to me that by getting a pretty	175.41800980199042
mule for Mousqueton—”	301.9949360126946
“Well, agreed for a pretty mule,” said Porthos; “you are right, I have	211.33278444999212
seen very great Spanish nobles whose whole suite were mounted on mules.	352.16958928299476
But then you understand, Madame Coquenard, a mule with feathers and	346.2430652588812
bells.”	185.5103573899539
“Be satisfied,” said the procurator’s wife.	217.20196185661007
“There remains the valise,” added Porthos.	244.79846220448616
“Oh, don’t let that disturb you,” cried Mme. Coquenard. “My husband has	230.31433554985585
five or six valises; you shall choose the best. There is one in	188.14825393336292
particular which he prefers in his journeys, large enough to hold all	173.26170803072137
the world.”	253.29605305441362
“Your valise is then empty?” asked Porthos, with simplicity.	308.4585893727302
“Certainly it is empty,” replied the procurator’s wife, in real	241.2093496108912
innocence.	283.4180584280658
“Ah, but the valise I want,” cried Porthos, “is a well-filled one, my	291.5893895654173
dear.”	238.15466190094162
Madame uttered fresh sighs. Molière had not written his scene in	230.17229458809217
“L’Avare” then. Mme. Coquenard was in the dilemma of Harpagan.	300.4180906445363
Finally, the rest of the equipment was successively debated in the same	202.42682366979597
manner; and the result of the sitting was that the procurator’s wife	208.6751838256018
should give eight hundred livres in money, and should furnish the horse	252.03373379295525
and the mule which should have the honor of carrying Porthos and	248.06676465437957
Mousqueton to glory.	216.9168928342032
These conditions being agreed to, Porthos took leave of Mme. Coquenard.	219.35872455151764
The latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but	224.45189550499478
Porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procurator’s wife was	259.9981553125604
obliged to give place to the king.	246.9386831385441
The Musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.	275.8859946843232
Chapter XXXIII.	194.36163264362722
SOUBRETTE AND MISTRESS	331.40335719722975
Meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the	352.8177341703599
wise counsels of Athos, D’Artagnan became hourly more in love with	318.6235048109899
Milady. Thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the	172.5642879228968
self-satisfied Gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not	308.16938956274635
fail to respond.	364.5610679075701
One day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at	322.0441661914508
heart as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the _soubrette_	214.73856906683142
under the gateway of the hôtel; but this time the pretty Kitty was not	218.58550193229652
contented with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the	336.4362034648772
hand.	236.18314067034098
“Good!” thought D’Artagnan, “She is charged with some message for me	206.5999409966121
from her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she	274.46449629040654
had not courage to speak.” And he looked down at the pretty girl with	346.4176847418053
the most triumphant air imaginable.	242.89792875010772
“I wish to say three words to you, Monsieur Chevalier,” stammered the	315.33520655200596
_soubrette_.	276.44284449674615
“Speak, my child, speak,” said D’Artagnan; “I listen.”	249.87597331379996
“Here? Impossible! That which I have to say is too long, and above all,	198.7662109153245
too secret.”	297.455254515522
“Well, what is to be done?”	247.0451204899933
“If Monsieur Chevalier would follow me?” said Kitty, timidly.	320.5032719338738
“Where you please, my dear child.”	363.8199990142806
“Come, then.”	182.30814276869083
And Kitty, who had not let go the hand of D’Artagnan, led him up a	294.5352314142759
little dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen	331.65047246010073
steps, opened a door.	185.99470709204306
“Come in here, Monsieur Chevalier,” said she; “here we shall be alone,	314.95159621840446
and can talk.”	230.20784450287937
“And whose room is this, my dear child?”	242.65259860029178
“It is mine, Monsieur Chevalier; it communicates with my mistress’s by	354.58644561723906
that door. But you need not fear. She will not hear what we say; she	267.3539860993279
never goes to bed before midnight.”	284.7553167029955
D’Artagnan cast a glance around him. The little apartment was charming	205.31278312251067
for its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were	212.69847433146975
directed to that door which Kitty said led to Milady’s chamber.	194.70353918715057
Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved	181.7826931476669
a deep sigh.	342.81228110757274
“You love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?” said	346.30902840508315
she.	286.9743440680227
“Oh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!”	361.23801121586234
Kitty breathed a second sigh.	171.3324238965576
“Alas, monsieur,” said she, “that is too bad.”	248.65901271176506
“What the devil do you see so bad in it?” said D’Artagnan.	296.44083237151153
“Because, monsieur,” replied Kitty, “my mistress loves you not at all.”	239.52216850432993
“_Hein!_” said D’Artagnan, “can she have charged you to tell me so?”	167.78573225693498
“Oh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken	281.5691762895784
the resolution to tell you so.”	352.6253995002384
“Much obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only—for the	259.2427679721497
information, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.”	206.8927821826531
“That is to say, you don’t believe what I have told you; is it not so?”	221.28487947830362
“We have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty	354.88455581225446
dear, were it only from self-love.”	258.2406888101493
“Then you don’t believe me?”	242.75851481961917
“I confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you	327.1705570222707
advance—”	365.95405056659865
“What do you think of this?”	191.39438361953484
Kitty drew a little note from her bosom.	316.0029057538332
“For me?” said D’Artagnan, seizing the letter.	230.4043184407862
“No; for another.”	192.3771098753599
“For another?”	195.84696633639922
“Yes.”	340.2199828135816
“His name; his name!” cried D’Artagnan.	294.03650755374883
“Read the address.”	329.9330877597167
“Monsieur El Comte de Wardes.”	322.4488681231711
The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the	330.9526154527546
mind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the	182.223693508787
letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was	290.36825850921065
going to do, or rather, what he was doing.	235.22592272686003
“Oh, good Lord, Monsieur Chevalier,” said she, “what are you doing?”	278.6867893212618
“I?” said D’Artagnan; “nothing,” and he read,	199.47995074199656
“You have not answered my first note. Are you indisposed, or have you	332.62249133210344
forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of Mme. de Guise?	362.12526255533555
You have an opportunity now, Count; do not allow it to escape.”	321.1114252826588
D’Artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his _self_-love: he	207.82529549429321
thought that it was in his _love_.	171.4516393353387
“Poor dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Kitty, in a voice full of	174.79525107723506
compassion, and pressing anew the young man’s hand.	184.07339117454617
“You pity me, little one?” said D’Artagnan.	291.94827605051455
“Oh, yes, and with all my heart; for I know what it is to be in love.”	181.5830562718546
“You know what it is to be in love?” said D’Artagnan, looking at her	247.55961279406023
for the first time with much attention.	343.1629655432016
“Alas, yes.”	217.2904428536711
“Well, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist	337.97382573511305
me in avenging myself on your mistress.”	365.7578599392957
“And what sort of revenge would you take?”	206.48668450730736
“I would triumph over her, and supplant my rival.”	310.1666524243896
“I will never help you in that, Monsieur Chevalier,” said Kitty,	234.71975575160687
warmly.	358.4274905768445
“And why not?” demanded D’Artagnan.	253.4582498715576
“For two reasons.”	219.71929103409082
“What ones?”	350.35489974704535
“The first is that my mistress will never love you.”	284.1588750363056
“How do you know that?”	167.2976889959058
“You have cut her to the heart.”	181.29873310140988
“I? In what can I have offended her—I who ever since I have known her	301.97085931580784
have lived at her feet like a slave? Speak, I beg you!”	245.68966399731028
“I will never confess that but to the man—who should read to the bottom	268.70521807410586
of my soul!”	293.86413014970765
D’Artagnan looked at Kitty for the second time. The young girl had	215.07736486336188
freshness and beauty which many duchesses would have purchased with	321.86991939739596
their coronets.	310.3152915220122
“Kitty,” said he, “I will read to the bottom of your soul whenever you	241.91652204640252
like; don’t let that disturb you.” And he gave her a kiss at which the	227.69303492823465
poor girl became as red as a cherry.	259.53744853147464
“Oh, no,” said Kitty, “it is not me you love! It is my mistress you	288.7631898743424
love; you told me so just now.”	352.34151009432003
“And does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?”	346.13990330544686
“The second reason, Monsieur the Chevalier,” replied Kitty, emboldened	358.5577047050009
by the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of	177.3323928976361
the eyes of the young man, “is that in love, everyone for herself!”	347.50956298546265
Then only D’Artagnan remembered the languishing glances of Kitty, her	236.70530126214493
constantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the	260.16403537913595
stairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep	355.45409209167417
sighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had	362.21159713563236
disdained the _soubrette_. He whose game is the eagle takes no heed of	334.38494821588387
the sparrow.	314.8525650921197
But this time our Gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be	184.80779606020053
derived from the love which Kitty had just confessed so innocently, or	288.53779813193785
so boldly: the interception of letters addressed to the Comte de	175.16625381613284
Wardes, news on the spot, entrance at all hours into Kitty’s chamber,	248.7873513640373
which was contiguous to her mistress’s. The perfidious deceiver was, as	337.6634587748157
may plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor	326.7699700289818
girl in order to obtain Milady, willy-nilly.	170.35410745132697
“Well,” said he to the young girl, “are you willing, my dear Kitty,	178.17613944214227
that I should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?”	284.27609238143384
“What love?” asked the young girl.	244.68258132718486
“Of that which I am ready to feel toward you.”	189.93686491420885
“And what is that proof?”	354.79160796895684
“Are you willing that I should this evening pass with you the time I	352.5451581373725
generally spend with your mistress?”	274.13733386360315
“Oh, yes,” said Kitty, clapping her hands, “very willing.”	353.3433424621315
“Well, then, come here, my dear,” said D’Artagnan, establishing himself	253.35324252899576
in an easy chair; “come, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest	307.768338008818
_soubrette_ I ever saw!”	330.15211047793065
And he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked	268.20029453902634
nothing better than to believe him, did believe him. Nevertheless, to	305.086853808614
D’Artagnan’s great astonishment, the pretty Kitty defended herself	172.64800325973712
resolutely.	179.49510246638408
Time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. Midnight	330.34019351045083
sounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in Milady’s	274.6503861513382
chamber.	263.15481159385814
“Good God,” cried Kitty, “there is my mistress calling me! Go; go	356.68903276763984
directly!”	215.91399148049317
D’Artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey,	222.77008715120004
then, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that	287.77507571866056
leading to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing	301.47892460851784
gowns of Milady.	167.15397720510722
“What are you doing?” cried Kitty.	248.12177642665486
D’Artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet	172.30460770701944
without reply.	257.23188957066156
“Well,” cried Milady, in a sharp voice. “Are you asleep, that you don’t	183.75353245827625
answer when I ring?”	360.0378790016424
And D’Artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently.	350.2162494372399
“Here am I, Milady, here am I!” cried Kitty, springing forward to meet	302.7327517237187
her mistress.	167.88484885690028
Both went into the bedroom, and as the door of communication remained	342.79479101445804
open, D’Artagnan could hear Milady for some time scolding her maid. She	365.4787772771712
was at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while	203.27175365856186
Kitty was assisting her mistress.	350.8547841784773
“Well,” said Milady, “I have not seen our Gascon this evening.”	255.21616220529586
“What, Milady! has he not come?” said Kitty. “Can he be inconstant	291.3813433363217
before being happy?”	333.75301779932227
“Oh, no; he must have been prevented by Monsieur de Tréville or	315.14439981431167
Monsieur Dessessart. I understand my game, Kitty; I have this one	340.54487970861163
safe.”	181.1167123748773
“What will you do with him, madame?”	217.76090032334645
“What will I do with him? Be easy, Kitty, there is something between	175.04734402909938
that man and me that he is quite ignorant of: he nearly made me lose my	170.7690297624777
credit with his Eminence. Oh, I will be revenged!”	175.22379303993714
“I believed that Madame loved him.”	302.5825337101535
“I love him? I detest him! An idiot, who held the life of Lord de	222.6458568678268
Winter in his hands and did not kill him, by which I missed three	339.13563726828625
hundred thousand livres’ income.”	196.68550729031983
“That’s true,” said Kitty; “your son was the only heir of his uncle,	174.56227565063494
and until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his	228.2393306260968
fortune.”	249.73372137487974
D’Artagnan shuddered to the marrow at hearing this suave creature	295.3713998441661
reproach him, with that sharp voice which she took such pains to	249.09833696215554
conceal in conversation, for not having killed a man whom he had seen	363.1439932306371
load her with kindnesses.	287.04693250265353
“For all this,” continued Milady, “I should long ago have revenged	166.88098264892415
myself on him if, and I don’t know why, the cardinal had not requested	303.2032808916371
me to conciliate him.”	306.97570520137134
“Oh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so	236.20409316659283
fond of.”	296.04217034693744
“What, the mercer’s wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs? Has he not already	285.55017116108957
forgotten she ever existed? Fine vengeance that, on my faith!”	253.86118203908416
A cold sweat broke from D’Artagnan’s brow. Why, this woman was a	261.9925851970847
monster! He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was	203.18814322430194
finished.	305.7709306139048
“That will do,” said Milady; “go into your own room, and tomorrow	200.8933449419646
endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave you.”	188.0589674657405
“For Monsieur de Wardes?” said Kitty.	307.05277983713484
“To be sure; for Monsieur de Wardes.”	216.6526445236803
“Now, there is one,” said Kitty, “who appears to me quite a different	196.8029251598074
sort of a man from that poor Monsieur d’Artagnan.”	327.6659643527508
“Go to bed, mademoiselle,” said Milady; “I don’t like comments.”	231.08925796501552
D’Artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which	360.62435755982733
Milady fastened herself in. On her side, but as softly as possible,	328.2484901415942
Kitty turned the key of the lock, and then D’Artagnan opened the closet	257.15307150039604
door.	187.4081971118164
“Oh, good Lord!” said Kitty, in a low voice, “what is the matter with	168.7512606551126
you? How pale you are!”	309.17340050297094
“The abominable creature,” murmured D’Artagnan.	332.9107204931163
“Silence, silence, begone!” said Kitty. “There is nothing but a	343.2523375657903
wainscot between my chamber and Milady’s; every word that is uttered in	357.7616957026117
one can be heard in the other.”	182.89190828004058
“That’s exactly the reason I won’t go,” said D’Artagnan.	203.70708016749728
“What!” said Kitty, blushing.	203.82033522150482
“Or, at least, I will go—later.”	307.9483170286069
He drew Kitty to him. She had the less motive to resist, resistance	254.49481573270396
would make so much noise. Therefore Kitty surrendered.	240.088766640233
It was a movement of vengeance upon Milady. D’Artagnan believed it	364.6454104544456
right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. With a little	290.0741161064021
more heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but	188.80448231571086
the principal features of his character were ambition and pride. It	336.7484589506855
must, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he	361.6718096364252
made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had	282.79557710031224
become of Mme. Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to	238.41127502459304
D’Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress	231.62890740040308
never admitting her into half her secrets—only she believed she could	325.6245844327343
say she was not dead.	255.71014172357587
As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the	198.09475909966312
cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time D’Artagnan was	239.1273673044812
better informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel	217.57993196677052
at the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost	167.3743856603135
without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.	362.3580740065562
But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the	276.8223372775531
profound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his	197.07158871113444
not having killed her brother-in-law.	279.00342697093816
D’Artagnan came the next day to Milady’s, and finding her in a very	194.57905848552173
ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes	226.8884664056393
that provoked her thus. Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with	227.98198253602706
her. The poor girl ventured a glance at D’Artagnan which said, “See how	306.7383560703554
I suffer on your account!”	296.7705952438872
Toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became	350.2204354639846
milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of D’Artagnan, and	191.29456955677526
even gave him her hand to kiss.	305.74301072840274
D’Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a	335.49674854849275
youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his	181.64064010441572
court to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind.	216.47830724052733
He found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up	173.9891246280742
to her chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely	241.39518178267892
scolded. Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de	261.8923258875164
Wardes, and she ordered Kitty to come at nine o’clock in the morning to	171.080905323816
take a third letter.	169.71046381831047
D’Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following	176.73144549396721
morning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.	222.6496122060486
Things passed as on the night before. D’Artagnan concealed himself in	224.94723849046025
his closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the	255.61842370964948
door. As the night before, D’Artagnan did not return home till five	251.2343107398458
o’clock in the morning.	244.64456528770546
At eleven o’clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh	277.74834821405705
billet from Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with	346.296745286185
D’Artagnan; she gave it to him at once. She belonged body and soul to	227.6827588149215
her handsome soldier.	315.23824580113217
D’Artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:	303.8650666013816
This is the third time I have written to you to tell you that I love	322.1331950096135
you. Beware that I do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that I	332.9825243804835
detest you.	357.6961185670698
    If you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the	232.89781313199853
    young girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit	269.9285650765204
    may obtain his pardon.	238.02904216731076
D’Artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.	172.62608537105518
“Oh, you love her still,” said Kitty, who had not taken her eyes off	363.59301437976217
the young man’s countenance for an instant.	297.1715063839948
“No, Kitty, you are mistaken. I do not love her, but I will avenge	220.9061552132367
myself for her contempt.”	180.4840806769385
“Oh, yes, I know what sort of vengeance! You told me that!”	241.9958148547019
“What matters it to you, Kitty? You know it is you alone whom I love.”	309.032077787596
“How can I know that?”	313.48056193324635
“By the scorn I will throw upon her.”	215.97425754865415
D’Artagnan took a pen and wrote:	185.45348819054652
MADAME, Until the present moment I could not believe that it was to me	256.00489534835947
your first two letters were addressed, so unworthy did I feel myself of	214.69857212461636
such an honor; besides, I was so seriously indisposed that I could not	323.85213527015384
in any case have replied to them.	211.1740077255209
    But now I am forced to believe in the excess of your kindness,	213.8378033907075
    since not only your letter but your servant assures me that I have	316.3561010766084
    the good fortune to be beloved by you.	261.4527165090293
    She has no occasion to teach me the way in which a man of spirit	297.01131113199983
    may obtain his pardon. I will come and ask mine at eleven o’clock	167.69456370070847
    this evening.	277.48728034566636
    To delay it a single day would be in my eyes now to commit a fresh	242.15966953056628
    offense.	253.7909586903677
    From him whom you have rendered the happiest of men,	318.35162809185914
COMTE DE WARDES	192.52412682050098
This note was in the first place a forgery; it was likewise an	361.2870458710479
indelicacy. It was even, according to our present manners, something	254.05959047793323
like an infamous action; but at that period people did not manage	183.41615105326656
affairs as they do today. Besides, D’Artagnan from her own admission	346.22918282832165
knew Milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could	245.96386335886427
entertain no respect for her. And yet, notwithstanding this want of	304.3263840147158
respect, he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in	278.7857709921344
his veins—passion drunk with contempt; but passion or thirst, as the	321.44584373922714
reader pleases.	230.4862666738177
D’Artagnan’s plan was very simple. By Kitty’s chamber he could gain	246.2506759423669
that of her mistress. He would take advantage of the first moment of	279.30133606613566
surprise, shame, and terror, to triumph over her. He might fail, but	332.1911058567124
something must be left to chance. In eight days the campaign would	180.6982746782746
open, and he would be compelled to leave Paris; D’Artagnan had no time	190.76437834047906
for a prolonged love siege.	339.9838380217931
“There,” said the young man, handing Kitty the letter sealed; “give	177.46096534135975
that to Milady. It is the count’s reply.”	248.40642168987287
Poor Kitty became as pale as death; she suspected what the letter	181.37980145902577
contained.	178.63830645735234
“Listen, my dear girl,” said D’Artagnan; “you cannot but perceive that	180.90167361642455
all this must end, some way or other. Milady may discover that you gave	185.86106511652042
the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count’s; that it is I	170.28446966641275
who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de	298.08775848776804
Wardes. Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not	364.32263846854653
the woman to limit her vengeance.”	242.26180123344528
“Alas!” said Kitty, “for whom have I exposed myself to all that?”	271.3463933358512
“For me, I well know, my sweet girl,” said D’Artagnan. “But I am	200.18990097953997
grateful, I swear to you.”	337.54866896953286
“But what does this note contain?”	353.91092205363003
“Milady will tell you.”	219.9808151408527
“Ah, you do not love me!” cried Kitty, “and I am very wretched.”	342.7974572325427
To this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.	267.05183294544236
D’Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great	250.91033536105016
delusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the	315.7547169545011
letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all	306.97642259852427
D’Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her	209.94131472374707
mistress’s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he	293.193425289051
left the mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed	198.57179031498038
poor Kitty’s consolation.	210.44955219334688
Chapter XXXIV.	262.3274726586973
IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF	185.17257820968098
Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there	265.9599823576692
had been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one	264.54546282229643
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.	180.3047092755734
Duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which	169.97160577905638
was gliding away so rapidly—only they had agreed to meet once a week,	202.92887021304134
about one o’clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in	293.43198366957876
agreement with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold	346.0299234697014
of his door.	195.89480138613354
This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to	318.3047100611575
find D’Artagnan. Soon as Kitty left him, D’Artagnan directed his steps	173.32841835185113
toward the Rue Férou.	237.02857829073452
He found Athos and Aramis philosophizing. Aramis had some slight	171.3462543993744
inclination to resume the cassock. Athos, according to his system,	237.7411770296604
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. Athos believed that everyone	356.3314813899499
should be left to his own free will. He never gave advice but when it	320.1161587633605
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.	169.0557171620464
“People, in general,” he said, “only ask advice not to follow it; or if	179.8236114188083
they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for	245.7767234471308
having given it.”	305.82483469327076
Porthos arrived a minute after D’Artagnan. The four friends were	230.34517154128676
reunited.	201.08891952418685
The four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of	195.7148097728419
Porthos, tranquillity; that of D’Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis,	290.59852615000636
uneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness.	176.75566137718081
At the end of a moment’s conversation, in which Porthos hinted that a	306.2537362483175
lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his	184.54188863027267
embarrassment, Mousqueton entered. He came to request his master to	271.46119130478314
return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously	227.5603941134818
said.	169.5579903493627
“Is it my equipment?”	343.9293278192815
“Yes and no,” replied Mousqueton.	363.9977141475624
“Well, but can’t you speak?”	176.4688613726751
“Come, monsieur.”	212.69542421481822
Porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton. An instant	205.73666981690167
after, Bazin made his appearance at the door.	250.26720068618124
“What do you want with me, my friend?” said Aramis, with that mildness	188.26850197565673
of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were	223.7017229237276
directed toward the Church.	334.4490991851773
“A man wishes to see Monsieur at home,” replied Bazin.	189.82295602002705
“A man! What man?”	271.92760891249947
“A mendicant.”	359.8713374090921
“Give him alms, Bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner.”	205.81923368428932
“This mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you	183.6321136614994
will be very glad to see him.”	193.09215057713794
“Has he sent no particular message for me?”	316.02385666842866
“Yes. If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come,” he said, “tell him I am	365.93362340712423
from Tours.”	210.04987986421887
“From Tours!” cried Aramis. “A thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no	306.504964269203
doubt this man brings me the news I expected.” And rising also, he went	272.2467403815548
off at a quick pace. There remained Athos and D’Artagnan.	261.47514518844264
“I believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you	274.0528173541732
think, D’Artagnan?” said Athos.	256.83646635445643
“I know that Porthos was in a fair way,” replied D’Artagnan; “and as to	199.83666360486905
Aramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his	357.2008357785012
account. But you, my dear Athos—you, who so generously distributed the	298.7810766246272
Englishman’s pistoles, which were our legitimate property—what do you	268.50018117101047
mean to do?”	288.5370088387857
“I am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it	176.06727112599498
is blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his	270.88718988157297
pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.”	319.3795551952038
“Go to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.”	281.6162087452963
“Let it pass. What do you think of Monsieur de Tréville telling me,	180.0544237998301
when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated	205.5838241885278
with the suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?”	219.6597639097146
“That is to say, I visit an Englishwoman—the one I named.”	224.84101464688095
“Oh, ay! the fair woman on whose account I gave you advice, which	302.778672742129
naturally you took care not to adopt.”	347.2094721873144
“I gave you my reasons.”	249.25768821559882
“Yes; you look there for your outfit, I think you said.”	231.0598468521094
“Not at all. I have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was	203.80268295647315
concerned in the abduction of Madame Bonacieux.”	282.16929304161107
“Yes, I understand now: to find one woman, you court another. It is the	315.17220040707264
longest road, but certainly the most amusing.”	358.18432908281704
D’Artagnan was on the point of telling Athos all; but one consideration	301.0107265389232
restrained him. Athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;	209.73496007798394
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for Milady, he	208.56807847113743
was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this	235.76414973096126
Puritan. He was therefore silent; and as Athos was the least	281.517009857919
inquisitive of any man on earth, D’Artagnan’s confidence stopped there.	364.03933736914485
We will therefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to	287.62072602762936
say to each other, and follow Aramis.	332.48729112879676
Upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came	287.2212445731999
from Tours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or	339.4502696319947
rather went before, Bazin; he ran without stopping from the Rue Férou	253.89909006384346
to the Rue de Vaugirard. On entering he found a man of short stature	167.62223712986415
and intelligent eyes, but covered with rags.	359.9724948008613
“You have asked for me?” said the Musketeer.	314.39461155463346
“I wish to speak with Monsieur Aramis. Is that your name, monsieur?”	221.72541504983025
“My very own. You have brought me something?”	286.53941503948715
“Yes, if you show me a certain embroidered handkerchief.”	282.23609679231737
“Here it is,” said Aramis, taking a small key from his breast and	348.5425177140905
opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl, “here it is.	289.0086251638396
Look.”	256.9498113787116
“That is right,” replied the mendicant; “dismiss your lackey.”	180.24412150587912
In fact, Bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his	274.6363477842739
master, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at	210.2437446615524
the same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him. At	279.5970659911826
the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and	255.3794292956913
he was obliged to obey.	364.24863476958376
Bazin gone, the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be	204.76043740255454
sure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged	222.70459902478598
vest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper	241.5161750847891
part of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.	252.40389900704488
Aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the	206.61208609782327
superscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the	193.4543153670879
epistle, which contained what follows:	202.84396841344716
“My Friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some	204.82486674414474
time separated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond	173.2632039764558
return. Perform your duty in camp; I will do mine elsewhere. Accept	173.4912673597301
that which the bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome	346.4875304853166
true gentleman, and think of me, who kisses tenderly your black eyes.	308.9480203083842
    “Adieu; or rather, _au revoir_.”	302.5692575933409
The mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his	270.67140352450235
rags a hundred and fifty Spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on	365.1465420150973
the table; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the	318.95806546224094
young man, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to	295.4706224645431
him.	348.0578373851807
Aramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript:	246.81808540137587
PS. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee	228.466983687119
of Spain!	220.9017773773352
“Golden dreams!” cried Aramis. “Oh, beautiful life! Yes, we are young;	248.58541685346674
yes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all,	170.63207241922262
all, all, are thine, my adored mistress!”	194.45425607127063
And he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look	197.59002486727348
at the gold which sparkled on the table.	223.85380209077323
Bazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to	264.5434277112528
exclude him, he bade him come in.	294.71298795812413
Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came	296.973658836704
to announce D’Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could	336.59194831682663
be, came to Aramis on leaving Athos.	354.18366650204234
Now, as D’Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin	285.9237757485297
forgot to announce him, he announced himself.	236.31030327286237
“The devil! my dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, “if these are the prunes	227.3235879454567
that are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to	209.11902069205078
the gardener who gathers them.”	216.37417828714987
“You are mistaken, friend D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, always on his	345.3573687759609
guard; “this is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of	279.6390998637918
that poem in one-syllable verse which I began yonder.”	241.83434556748335
“Ah, indeed,” said D’Artagnan. “Well, your publisher is very generous,	189.88463663814244
my dear Aramis, that’s all I can say.”	278.32685852779997
“How, monsieur?” cried Bazin, “a poem sell so dear as that! It is	172.11979996843453
incredible! Oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may	313.1489972877946
become equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benserade. I like	328.9494974831035
that. A poet is as good as an abbé. Ah! Monsieur Aramis, become a poet,	242.27954561273333
I beg of you.”	358.7680113618902
“Bazin, my friend,” said Aramis, “I believe you meddle with my	213.29824646185153
conversation.”	318.10323241838967
Bazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.	189.28686560930984
“Ah!” said D’Artagnan with a smile, “you sell your productions at their	303.4784274046493
weight in gold. You are very fortunate, my friend; but take care or you	177.33720853444686
will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which	275.53227474292527
also comes, no doubt, from your publisher.”	214.08449740130823
Aramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his	288.3246942773619
doublet.	176.28749055192796
“My dear D’Artagnan,” said he, “if you please, we will join our	330.3901414926294
friends; as I am rich, we will today begin to dine together again,	227.29104912521916
expecting that you will be rich in your turn.”	349.6249863479003
“My faith!” said D’Artagnan, with great pleasure. “It is long since we	248.29163504508338
have had a good dinner; and I, for my part, have a somewhat hazardous	306.06677820144836
expedition for this evening, and shall not be sorry, I confess, to	316.534801019769
fortify myself with a few glasses of good old Burgundy.”	285.3606998946495
“Agreed, as to the old Burgundy; I have no objection to that,” said	223.68992441877253
Aramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his	261.51618635834427
ideas of conversion.	290.93944345710713
And having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer	337.7527096249771
the needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid	281.91574883565977
with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served	363.87529237395563
him as a talisman.	227.24928015211705
The two friends repaired to Athos’s, and he, faithful to his vow of not	280.5962601293795
going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. As he	188.57468791733731
was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, D’Artagnan and	222.06435771437535
Aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.	352.4788242365096
They went to find Porthos, and at the corner of the Rue Bac met	291.70171102731615
Mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a	229.79372299402212
mule and a horse.	312.9266792812064
D’Artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from	192.3219553002834
joy.	333.1777525850914
“Ah, my yellow horse,” cried he. “Aramis, look at that horse!”	249.1490902335119
“Oh, the frightful brute!” said Aramis.	209.37345462967127
“Ah, my dear,” replied D’Artagnan, “upon that very horse I came to	319.4719437948196
Paris.”	182.4754113003392
“What, does Monsieur know this horse?” said Mousqueton.	196.90709635559713
“It is of an original color,” said Aramis; “I never saw one with such a	204.76181813751634
hide in my life.”	177.8992143950997
“I can well believe it,” replied D’Artagnan, “and that was why I got	230.22923343155372
three crowns for him. It must have been for his hide, for, _certes_,	190.5295250740509
the carcass is not worth eighteen livres. But how did this horse come	300.6353671762165
into your hands, Mousqueton?”	357.29585372030795
“Pray,” said the lackey, “say nothing about it, monsieur; it is a	336.6072907598096
frightful trick of the husband of our duchess!”	194.4456648653523
“How is that, Mousqueton?”	342.4994314644387
“Why, we are looked upon with a rather favorable eye by a lady of	221.5850369906069
quality, the Duchesse de—but, your pardon; my master has commanded me	208.23967209239436
to be discreet. She had forced us to accept a little souvenir, a	231.84150387534766
magnificent Spanish _genet_ and an Andalusian mule, which were	319.60443712836917
beautiful to look upon. The husband heard of the affair; on their way	344.31909521704046
he confiscated the two magnificent beasts which were being sent to us,	291.4043881616418
and substituted these horrible animals.”	317.4099679218501
“Which you are taking back to him?” said D’Artagnan.	195.09071256522813
“Exactly!” replied Mousqueton. “You may well believe that we will not	324.2684585494618
accept such steeds as these in exchange for those which had been	227.70544601106582
promised to us.”	191.34391079200546
“No, _pardieu;_ though I should like to have seen Porthos on my yellow	235.4132919653507
horse. That would give me an idea of how I looked when I arrived in	247.515704379491
Paris. But don’t let us hinder you, Mousqueton; go and perform your	209.05765009302465
master’s orders. Is he at home?”	328.25834258483866
“Yes, monsieur,” said Mousqueton, “but in a very ill humor. Get up!”	192.27519337920273
He continued his way toward the Quai des Grands Augustins, while the	223.474699222331
two friends went to ring at the bell of the unfortunate Porthos. He,	289.4393142671823
having seen them crossing the yard, took care not to answer, and they	317.27720528759494
rang in vain.	248.25254377045974
Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his way, and crossing the Pont Neuf,	287.6433998478134
still driving the two sorry animals before him, he reached the Rue aux	285.64102466046677
Ours. Arrived there, he fastened, according to the orders of his	179.42411793672252
master, both horse and mule to the knocker of the procurator’s door;	235.34186220045643
then, without taking any thought for their future, he returned to	246.84168692130416
Porthos, and told him that his commission was completed.	339.45618595320485
In a short time the two unfortunate beasts, who had not eaten anything	355.92941062006287
since the morning, made such a noise in raising and letting fall the	185.4883405414952
knocker that the procurator ordered his errand boy to go and inquire in	305.7660158598834
the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.	272.3648094432664
Mme. Coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first	320.4540998406024
comprehend this restitution; but the visit of Porthos soon enlightened	214.05790639933005
her. The anger which fired the eyes of the Musketeer, in spite of his	210.8815620956375
efforts to suppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. In fact,	211.55144221839842
Mousqueton had not concealed from his master that he had met D’Artagnan	356.0597615498341
and Aramis, and that D’Artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the	186.12207040172632
Béarnese pony upon which he had come to Paris, and which he had sold	303.7837703376638
for three crowns.	334.88028031986653
Porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the	273.2960600152811
procurator’s wife in the cloister of St. Magloire. The procurator,	233.95700023889202
seeing he was going, invited him to dinner—an invitation which the	307.2954936366262
Musketeer refused with a majestic air.	176.20265829399315
Mme. Coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of St. Magloire, for	189.7904243681873
she guessed the reproaches that awaited her there; but she was	364.7802903398087
fascinated by the lofty airs of Porthos.	198.13347237639198
All that which a man wounded in his self-love could let fall in the	181.07366580338794
shape of imprecations and reproaches upon the head of a woman Porthos	296.35523949449953
let fall upon the bowed head of the procurator’s wife.	260.32706475785034
“Alas,” said she, “I did all for the best! One of our clients is a	340.39367485682664
horsedealer; he owes money to the office, and is backward in his pay. I	238.64688514059378
took the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that	353.57477230099244
they were two noble steeds.”	199.09147636644585
“Well, madame,” said Porthos, “if he owed you more than five crowns,	184.78783619086292
your horsedealer is a thief.”	195.19825027272034
“There is no harm in trying to buy things cheap, Monsieur Porthos,”	264.4352206362812
said the procurator’s wife, seeking to excuse herself.	260.08789336918403
“No, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought	233.07819885823892
to permit others to seek more generous friends.” And Porthos, turning	318.5637908523073
on his heel, made a step to retire.	256.87578415792984
“Monsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!” cried the procurator’s wife. “I	284.6724097590404
have been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it	329.72078173428486
was to equip a cavalier like you.”	187.13666941894164
Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator’s wife	303.5639334290593
fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses	172.9868551219875
and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet.	257.18992787534467
“Stop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!” cried she. “Stop, and	335.62139632679424
let us talk.”	243.03629475746834
“Talking with you brings me misfortune,” said Porthos.	311.5607455321084
“But, tell me, what do you ask?”	342.5780991884323
“Nothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for	212.55771785126558
something.”	226.56777818452977
The procurator’s wife hung upon the arm of Porthos, and in the violence	252.1066311735346
of her grief she cried out, “Monsieur Porthos, I am ignorant of all	317.6570909716528
such matters! How should I know what a horse is? How should I know what	310.535007395717
horse furniture is?”	316.8486098945517
“You should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are;	300.9166015196313
but you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.”	285.1958494139836
“It was wrong, Monsieur Porthos; but I will repair that wrong, upon my	364.5980911169548
word of honor.”	186.51510082225815
“How so?” asked the Musketeer.	258.12692962586004
“Listen. This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Duc de	343.24446601141403
Chaulnes, who has sent for him. It is for a consultation, which will	176.062379535313
last three hours at least. Come! We shall be alone, and can make up our	278.05398362084253
accounts.”	330.79727103223235
“In good time. Now you talk, my dear.”	227.50686474542886
“You pardon me?”	221.735587663281
“We shall see,” said Porthos, majestically; and the two separated	356.2591180222228
saying, “Till this evening.”	296.1155526602944
“The devil!” thought Porthos, as he walked away, “it appears I am	359.91166890563824
getting nearer to Monsieur Coquenard’s strongbox at last.”	352.3473584594543
Chapter XXXV.	186.57558427085266
A GASCON A MATCH FOR CUPID	177.01980407712176
The evening so impatiently waited for by Porthos and by D’Artagnan at	302.2486463708342
last arrived.	285.90688780668705
As was his custom, D’Artagnan presented himself at Milady’s at about	264.83107915202476
nine o’clock. He found her in a charming humor. Never had he been so	216.03264647860152
well received. Our Gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that	353.94805176150226
his billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.	355.1329627519528
Kitty entered to bring some sherbet. Her mistress put on a charming	239.12435130782566
face, and smiled on her graciously; but alas! the poor girl was so sad	270.7662409482085
that she did not even notice Milady’s condescension.	364.97316025455234
D’Artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced	318.47310045558135
to acknowledge that in his opinion Dame Nature had made a mistake in	293.2935150140226
their formation. To the great lady she had given a heart vile and	304.0197096114537
venal; to the _soubrette_ she had given the heart of a duchess.	340.0506846492567
At ten o’clock Milady began to appear restless. D’Artagnan knew what	331.64328318839836
she wanted. She looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at	281.9093107642479
D’Artagnan with an air which said, “You are very amiable, no doubt, but	207.5857732889727
you would be _charming_ if you would only depart.”	207.71830396200983
D’Artagnan rose and took his hat; Milady gave him her hand to kiss. The	305.09344510070355
young man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a	289.8175201950306
sentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.	315.51207073403043
“She loves him devilishly,” he murmured. Then he went out.	237.2959188931593
This time Kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the	170.7656268219856
antechamber, nor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door. It was	232.37214715486496
necessary that D’Artagnan should find alone the staircase and the	206.99703427395804
little chamber. She heard him enter, but she did not raise her head.	226.82206423695968
The young man went to her and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.	200.2531033599425
As D’Artagnan had presumed, on receiving his letter, Milady in a	360.5296867731305
delirium of joy had told her servant everything; and by way of	309.6708574709013
recompense for the manner in which she had this time executed the	233.59145403970768
commission, she had given Kitty a purse.	231.96513622825233
Returning to her own room, Kitty had thrown the purse into a corner,	363.17845533747004
where it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.	327.4925114362754
The poor girl, under the caresses of D’Artagnan, lifted her head.	249.14467662974923
D’Artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance. She	223.64136351305677
joined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a	309.7178091140962
word. As little sensitive as was the heart of D’Artagnan, he was	188.56783721376817
touched by this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his	167.8978869959284
projects, above all to this one, to change the program which he had	257.07963591172904
laid out in advance. He did not therefore allow her any hope that he	332.32828770330866
would flinch; only he represented his action as one of simple	279.8476352692619
vengeance.	233.85098092438182
For the rest this vengeance was very easy; for Milady, doubtless to	311.6527409645006
conceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered Kitty to extinguish all	226.1586176923122
the lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber itself.	339.6689942970453
Before daybreak M. de Wardes must take his departure, still in	198.13266658865746
obscurity.	197.12223968917456
Presently they heard Milady retire to her room. D’Artagnan slipped into	289.66287340986366
the wardrobe. Hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded.	206.7210348736176
Kitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the	294.089796562748
partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed	237.63451921370924
between the two women.	248.71723609842252
Milady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest	328.82973240622334
details of the pretended interview of the _soubrette_ with De Wardes	350.3363279691531
when he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the	210.6369492808214
expression of his face; if he seemed very amorous. And to all these	334.17202617854207
questions poor Kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a	187.59915373792052
stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however	311.9027351745917
remark, solely because happiness is egotistical.	329.08199994199447
Finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached,	283.54685374120925
Milady had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return	362.56780160069195
to her own chamber, and introduce De Wardes whenever he presented	212.76042230949813
himself.	167.3461591992927
Kitty’s detention was not long. Hardly had D’Artagnan seen, through a	275.88058951452234
crevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity, than	335.6702509683987
he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty	210.17897254247757
reclosed the door of communication.	188.05666040969254
“What is that noise?” demanded Milady.	364.09153056735136
“It is I,” said D’Artagnan in a subdued voice, “I, the Comte de	212.28654565803458
Wardes.”	348.5318314973165
“Oh, my God, my God!” murmured Kitty, “he has not even waited for the	279.1600742117184
hour he himself named!”	179.94445142262396
“Well,” said Milady, in a trembling voice, “why do you not enter?	261.7362559028445
Count, Count,” added she, “you know that I wait for you.”	311.3927348812827
At this appeal D’Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the	241.7352005073798
chamber.	288.28664725312177
If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives	343.1917034285658
under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to	321.3017542997304
his happy rival. D’Artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had	219.79685328723215
not foreseen. Jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much	204.3748816886789
as poor Kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.	212.19151620119138
“Yes, Count,” said Milady, in her softest voice, and pressing his hand	364.1537901803648
in her own, “I am happy in the love which your looks and your words	329.22323770048644
have expressed to me every time we have met. I also—I love you. Oh,	195.13633236367156
tomorrow, tomorrow, I must have some pledge from you which will prove	272.61882536787095
that you think of me; and that you may not forget me, take this!” and	269.4135501025234
she slipped a ring from her finger onto D’Artagnan’s. D’Artagnan	174.32334841114883
remembered having seen this ring on the finger of Milady; it was a	187.5956922082521
magnificent sapphire, encircled with brilliants.	198.5135962339566
The first movement of D’Artagnan was to return it, but Milady added,	247.86267517965166
“No, no! Keep that ring for love of me. Besides, in accepting it,” she	298.49509823534584
added, in a voice full of emotion, “you render me a much greater	333.82521025238725
service than you imagine.”	299.0682681614359
“This woman is full of mysteries,” murmured D’Artagnan to himself. At	261.731813806198
that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all. He even opened his	189.66819012612845
mouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he	199.28464934992965
had come; but she added, “Poor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon	262.66885272498536
barely failed to kill.”	238.01937227025002
The monster was himself.	309.39405668919164
“Oh,” continued Milady, “do your wounds still make you suffer?”	276.8118334465833
“Yes, much,” said D’Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer.	307.7605146412093
“Be tranquil,” murmured Milady; “I will avenge you—and cruelly!”	274.7431641259841
“_Peste!_” said D’Artagnan to himself, “the moment for confidences has	281.13835074317194
not yet come.”	210.95142989314343
It took some time for D’Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but	230.26776109481753
then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had	284.0626767562978
completely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable	295.62539926008316
power; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have	168.47121039391658
believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart,	198.2925706867881
and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were,	338.61164402560394
diabolical.	197.15258636365382
Presently it sounded one o’clock. It was necessary to separate.	185.81989903693662
D’Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest	211.73407740826286
regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a	281.80571496935397
reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the	275.3673548540088
following week.	278.7401737725605
Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to D’Artagnan when he passed	364.5824017168969
through her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the	211.894625125835
darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.	327.5669751124314
The next morning D’Artagnan ran to find Athos. He was engaged in an	224.23232305069808
adventure so singular that he wished for counsel. He therefore told him	212.57655405830863
all.	287.13121419904996
“Your Milady,” said he, “appears to be an infamous creature, but not	342.58687929847235
the less you have done wrong to deceive her. In one fashion or another	166.7125357440789
you have a terrible enemy on your hands.”	188.74363726184103
While thus speaking Athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with	186.97062410421256
diamonds which had taken, on D’Artagnan’s finger, the place of the	297.1375553767133
queen’s ring, carefully kept in a casket.	271.8153878540777
“You notice my ring?” said the Gascon, proud to display so rich a gift	251.78694407801385
in the eyes of his friends.	235.17439974141845
“Yes,” said Athos, “it reminds me of a family jewel.”	277.84827877764917
“It is beautiful, is it not?” said D’Artagnan.	304.59238078321073
“Yes,” said Athos, “magnificent. I did not think two sapphires of such	315.89587968589876
a fine water existed. Have you traded it for your diamond?”	354.1832135884706
“No. It is a gift from my beautiful Englishwoman, or rather	197.69419124603408
Frenchwoman—for I am convinced she was born in France, though I have	212.95672221126136
not questioned her.”	276.03347221073216
“That ring comes from Milady?” cried Athos, with a voice in which it	352.1542905319561
was easy to detect strong emotion.	353.74485612907654
“Her very self; she gave it me last night. Here it is,” replied	338.00920873298685
D’Artagnan, taking it from his finger.	325.3730610435177
Athos examined it and became very pale. He tried it on his left hand;	189.4435978858853
it fit his finger as if made for it.	222.93279011995813
A shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of	184.83571640399032
this gentleman.	282.17919734349766
“It is impossible it can be she,” said he. “How could this ring come	306.51411370900473
into the hands of Milady Clarik? And yet it is difficult to suppose	282.4658655920782
such a resemblance should exist between two jewels.”	317.3840645134436
“Do you know this ring?” said D’Artagnan.	182.57020131701682
“I thought I did,” replied Athos; “but no doubt I was mistaken.” And he	275.97256598875094
returned D’Artagnan the ring without, however, ceasing to look at it.	172.73201286828186
“Pray, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, after a minute, “either take off that	207.15975431101242
ring or turn the mounting inside; it recalls such cruel recollections	321.69100320331745
that I shall have no head to converse with you. Don’t ask me for	254.6722245140508
counsel; don’t tell me you are perplexed what to do. But stop! let me	229.9331071550066
look at that sapphire again; the one I mentioned to you had one of its	272.1625072571213
faces scratched by accident.”	213.35469232182095
D’Artagnan took off the ring, giving it again to Athos.	327.6340048280255
Athos started. “Look,” said he, “is it not strange?” and he pointed out	201.97559063259368
to D’Artagnan the scratch he had remembered.	236.51460594039082
“But from whom did this ring come to you, Athos?”	233.40588442403828
“From my mother, who inherited it from her mother. As I told you, it is	293.58982684436205
an old family jewel.”	279.01474756575885
“And you—sold it?” asked D’Artagnan, hesitatingly.	275.54748593295756
“No,” replied Athos, with a singular smile. “I gave it away in a night	255.22487537585647
of love, as it has been given to you.”	271.2160844774049
D’Artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were	227.81425148425922
abysses in Milady’s soul whose depths were dark and unknown. He took	237.6877027359355
back the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger.	335.3663755529981
“D’Artagnan,” said Athos, taking his hand, “you know I love you; if I	264.8273972522761
had a son I could not love him better. Take my advice, renounce this	184.8764778832794
woman. I do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she is a	182.43098076237416
lost creature, and that there is something fatal about her.”	213.26336593997604
“You are right,” said D’Artagnan; “I will have done with her. I own	291.22751902579733
that this woman terrifies me.”	346.37597241576185
“Shall you have the courage?” said Athos.	168.08443449655397
“I shall,” replied D’Artagnan, “and instantly.”	166.350728320035
“In truth, my young friend, you will act rightly,” said the gentleman,	273.5653657015563
pressing the Gascon’s hand with an affection almost paternal; “and God	290.86527201645066
grant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not	209.40604778745643
leave a terrible trace in it!” And Athos bowed to D’Artagnan like a man	280.4492788061444
who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone	196.09283440311071
with his thoughts.	167.0748839631022
On reaching home D’Artagnan found Kitty waiting for him. A month of	321.6101120264151
fever could not have changed her more than this one night of	197.53354007293856
sleeplessness and sorrow.	355.351768190133
She was sent by her mistress to the false De Wardes. Her mistress was	305.21869706118395
mad with love, intoxicated with joy. She wished to know when her lover	328.81345055825966
would meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling,	322.1016298192591
awaited D’Artagnan’s reply. The counsels of his friend, joined to the	233.90203624495268
cries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and	205.111903521759
his vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again. As a reply, he wrote	227.6775207551323
the following letter:	262.91120397053413
Do not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting. Since my	173.19546045289604
convalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am	254.29745518119694
forced to regulate them a little. When your turn comes, I shall have	289.56478965445467
the honor to inform you of it. I kiss your hands.	268.14270379861387
COMTE DE WARDES	243.28276456010036
Not a word about the sapphire. Was the Gascon determined to keep it as	288.49205010410844
a weapon against Milady, or else, let us be frank, did he not reserve	265.6365112450618
the sapphire as a last resource for his outfit? It would be wrong to	178.83861738322955
judge the actions of one period from the point of view of another. That	229.95219754734987
which would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that	329.5753684109568
time quite a simple and natural affair, and the younger sons of the	268.9990190312999
best families were frequently supported by their mistresses. D’Artagnan	248.4019667380472
gave the open letter to Kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend	315.3483039351047
it, but who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time.	282.7962167083305
She could scarcely believe in her happiness; and D’Artagnan was forced	353.0549304778035
to renew with the living voice the assurances which he had written. And	262.13080247153346
whatever might be—considering the violent character of Milady—the	218.0191011739997
danger which the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her	259.3693563913115
mistress, she ran back to the Place Royale as fast as her legs could	286.59945113862534
carry her.	214.07573399700846
The heart of the best woman is pitiless toward the sorrows of a rival.	290.10975980612096
Milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to Kitty’s in bringing	331.4935973994948
it; but at the first words she read she became livid. She crushed the	313.206949383416
paper in her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon Kitty, she	197.58660494417478
cried, “What is this letter?”	342.97227572550264
“The answer to Madame’s,” replied Kitty, all in a tremble.	266.41440592707374
“Impossible!” cried Milady. “It is impossible a gentleman could have	201.69244553101137
written such a letter to a woman.” Then all at once, starting, she	349.7335385406164
cried, “My God! can he have—” and she stopped. She ground her teeth;	252.60661677610602
she was of the color of ashes. She tried to go toward the window for	174.63988968523688
air, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her,	330.71985889625256
and she sank into an armchair. Kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened	231.25908334616028
toward her and was beginning to open her dress; but Milady started up,	205.38040502030867
pushing her away. “What do you want with me?” said she, “and why do you	187.73237457991638
place your hand on me?”	214.19875708354436
“I thought that Madame was ill, and I wished to bring her help,”	318.31048225719053
responded the maid, frightened at the terrible expression which had	166.46553045043157
come over her mistress’s face.	245.6802127538715
“I faint? I? I? Do you take me for half a woman? When I am insulted I	322.1008546185983
do not faint; I avenge myself!”	358.74923921636514
And she made a sign for Kitty to leave the room.	170.9342043489243
Chapter XXXVI.	205.52382816651973
DREAM OF VENGEANCE	338.3255888341753
That evening Milady gave orders that when M. d’Artagnan came as usual,	303.8856571239943
he should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.	232.03918721394734
The next day Kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him	360.4843049411352
all that had passed on the preceding evening. D’Artagnan smiled; this	230.21224639404892
jealous anger of Milady was his revenge.	293.3205826289517
That evening Milady was still more impatient than on the preceding	207.95018025851496
evening. She renewed the order relative to the Gascon; but as before	296.91162874633767
she expected him in vain.	337.5358161295004
The next morning, when Kitty presented herself at D’Artagnan’s, she was	234.36972328449664
no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the	175.35441106517322
contrary sad as death.	307.8503103053228
D’Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she,	215.70187969892189
as her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.	227.51711858777182
This letter was in Milady’s handwriting; only this time it was	308.69274083403445
addressed to M. d’Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes.	298.87660101831773
He opened it and read as follows:	228.01859722321473
DEAR M. D’ARTAGNAN, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends,	291.8103828643546
particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a	173.08520259570503
time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day	186.56780643287442
before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening?	236.8097667709535
Your very grateful,	256.498993841575
MILADY CLARIK	213.9227754135079
“That’s all very simple,” said D’Artagnan; “I expected this letter. My	174.8905076625971
credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.”	260.79487783878716
“And will you go?” asked Kitty.	169.19941633210303
“Listen to me, my dear girl,” said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse	211.62863235166856
in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; “you must	329.1934783996693
understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive	169.14169437551323
invitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to	236.32544586199745
understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might	308.6313202823544
suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman	250.5776496726976
would go?”	330.5180033779884
“Oh, my God!” said Kitty, “you know how to represent things in such a	304.62185247805587
way that you are always in the right. You are going now to pay your	222.638278860711
court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in	326.3952861542548
your own name and with your own face, it will be much worse than	259.0611239630507
before.”	209.91511501743287
Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen. D’Artagnan	185.1496933416835
reassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to	248.32931543367465
the seductions of Milady.	172.57644965121614
He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more	299.99042445008774
grateful for her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient	343.10827641263154
to her orders. He did not dare to write for fear of not being able—to	256.65194492205023
such experienced eyes as those of Milady—to disguise his writing	317.1779277918072
sufficiently.	186.85186782590839
As nine o’clock sounded, D’Artagnan was at the Place Royale. It was	193.57384296664756
evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned,	279.0698031621301
for as soon as D’Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady	169.04217907101918
were visible, one of them ran to announce him.	175.34107375925458
“Show him in,” said Milady, in a quick tone, but so piercing that	273.53494326790104
D’Artagnan heard her in the antechamber.	276.80379961792414
He was introduced.	298.0761236122994
“I am at home to nobody,” said Milady; “observe, to _nobody_.”	234.831989181749
The servant went out.	166.89989683819576
D’Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady. She was pale, and looked	280.1018819297108
fatigued, either from tears or want of sleep. The number of lights had	279.94935323108507
been intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal	219.5262163200237
the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days.	290.25621579453843
D’Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry. She then made an	350.19105348229937
extraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed	315.60269336320874
countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile.	239.60209498777698
To the questions which D’Artagnan put concerning her health, she	305.16484901728154
replied, “Bad, very bad.”	199.93396704092387
“Then,” replied he, “my visit is ill-timed; you, no doubt, stand in	210.13399601718822
need of repose, and I will withdraw.”	188.19709398173887
“No, no!” said Milady. “On the contrary, stay, Monsieur d’Artagnan;	297.5311212767897
your agreeable company will divert me.”	357.272282535102
“Oh, oh!” thought D’Artagnan. “She has never been so kind before. On	305.5484885138055
guard!”	226.37979406114698
Milady assumed the most agreeable air possible, and conversed with more	335.79058806442174
than her usual brilliancy. At the same time the fever, which for an	301.96709133843046
instant abandoned her, returned to give luster to her eyes, color to	205.6043401593377
her cheeks, and vermillion to her lips. D’Artagnan was again in the	241.93999401532747
presence of the Circe who had before surrounded him with her	241.76716065838858
enchantments. His love, which he believed to be extinct but which was	196.87727277854097
only asleep, awoke again in his heart. Milady smiled, and D’Artagnan	325.0497008875924
felt that he could damn himself for that smile. There was a moment at	195.4819745760547
which he felt something like remorse.	244.96194522992693
By degrees, Milady became more communicative. She asked D’Artagnan if	346.23398075871376
he had a mistress.	218.56032485413544
“Alas!” said D’Artagnan, with the most sentimental air he could assume,	173.86490111189974
“can you be cruel enough to put such a question to me—to me, who, from	199.0756398625963
the moment I saw you, have only breathed and sighed through you and for	229.5447140694208
you?”	195.99762657970575
Milady smiled with a strange smile.	260.94821410998
“Then you love me?” said she.	312.5310320127803
“Have I any need to tell you so? Have you not perceived it?”	326.1644968795471
“It may be; but you know the more hearts are worth the capture, the	338.8006959109178
more difficult they are to be won.”	257.0409242426509
“Oh, difficulties do not affright me,” said D’Artagnan. “I shrink	243.87961339646534
before nothing but impossibilities.”	337.2243388368562
“Nothing is impossible,” replied Milady, “to true love.”	326.863064263017
“Nothing, madame?”	241.55970054198434
“Nothing,” replied Milady.	364.0143459279182
“The devil!” thought D’Artagnan. “The note is changed. Is she going to	197.82250403414403
fall in love with me, by chance, this fair inconstant; and will she be	198.38722189944613
disposed to give me myself another sapphire like that which she gave me	309.90727484374315
for De Wardes?”	256.2081860643694
D’Artagnan rapidly drew his seat nearer to Milady’s.	295.3630127301197
“Well, now,” she said, “let us see what you would do to prove this love	245.97831225405514
of which you speak.”	223.5618873238184
“All that could be required of me. Order; I am ready.”	235.2649999589108
“For everything?”	217.7191589967918
“For everything,” cried D’Artagnan, who knew beforehand that he had not	173.99035767425576
much to risk in engaging himself thus.	171.1606819736311
“Well, now let us talk a little seriously,” said Milady, in her turn	175.6753808256845
drawing her armchair nearer to D’Artagnan’s chair.	265.44102862675993
“I am all attention, madame,” said he.	193.73009706009663
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided for a moment; then, as if	258.3030693060645
appearing to have formed a resolution, she said, “I have an enemy.”	265.75749640657176
“You, madame!” said D’Artagnan, affecting surprise; “is that possible,	166.04322986897995
my God?—good and beautiful as you are!”	321.5283484671312
“A mortal enemy.”	332.21134137895604
“Indeed!”	353.6372571898137
“An enemy who has insulted me so cruelly that between him and me it is	175.3627261345117
war to the death. May I reckon on you as an auxiliary?”	316.49503451694346
D’Artagnan at once perceived the ground which the vindictive creature	172.59664400333958
wished to reach.	318.1154530646456
“You may, madame,” said he, with emphasis. “My arm and my life belong	175.8252963051469
to you, like my love.”	301.97765292452584
“Then,” said Milady, “since you are as generous as you are loving—”	176.88578345258912
She stopped.	342.16888367587956
“Well?” demanded D’Artagnan.	167.22939862297582
“Well,” replied Milady, after a moment of silence, “from the present	344.19543494667545
time, cease to talk of impossibilities.”	322.56221611105263
“Do not overwhelm me with happiness,” cried D’Artagnan, throwing	238.47313285942687
himself on his knees, and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to	332.56650244308054
him.	294.8177708178471
“Avenge me of that infamous De Wardes,” said Milady, between her teeth,	317.2332093902976
“and I shall soon know how to get rid of you—you double idiot, you	239.79264594655575
animated sword blade!”	261.15521488486814
“Fall voluntarily into my arms, hypocritical and dangerous woman,” said	192.02030042249476
D’Artagnan, likewise to himself, “after having abused me with such	175.3772388879308
effrontery, and afterward I will laugh at you with him whom you wish me	365.46665936314804
to kill.”	301.17842116000134
D’Artagnan lifted up his head.	360.99427641015666
“I am ready,” said he.	204.26074881581866
“You have understood me, then, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Milady.	307.33308710491207
“I could interpret one of your looks.”	311.4108701883707
“Then you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so	293.9738064392353
much renown?”	324.82258262044536
“Instantly!”	217.3781051012661
“But on my part,” said Milady, “how should I repay such a service? I	288.73579257765005
know these lovers. They are men who do nothing for nothing.”	230.2760772410623
“You know the only reply that I desire,” said D’Artagnan, “the only one	236.0778799245196
worthy of you and of me!”	231.5628927987192
And he drew nearer to her.	296.0344193621589
She scarcely resisted.	275.3343506120758
“Interested man!” cried she, smiling.	332.21876367745733
“Ah,” cried D’Artagnan, really carried away by the passion this woman	270.5730440187807
had the power to kindle in his heart, “ah, that is because my happiness	268.48902768188236
appears so impossible to me; and I have such fear that it should fly	355.4107985482096
away from me like a dream that I pant to make a reality of it.”	361.3837755624245
“Well, merit this pretended happiness, then!”	179.22451394953384
“I am at your orders,” said D’Artagnan.	287.2158560262774
“Quite certain?” said Milady, with a last doubt.	353.321131436159
“Only name to me the base man that has brought tears into your	273.04946398182017
beautiful eyes!”	294.68822665096957
“Who told you that I had been weeping?” said she.	196.0797477775751
“It appeared to me—”	218.86092304587584
“Such women as I never weep,” said Milady.	178.793268766326
“So much the better! Come, tell me his name!”	253.41248086487644
“Remember that his name is all my secret.”	200.4510603299677
“Yet I must know his name.”	270.98640523487234
“Yes, you must; see what confidence I have in you!”	359.6601549530202
“You overwhelm me with joy. What is his name?”	221.86606284859613
“You know him.”	177.6199266066021
“Indeed.”	243.67359360231433
“Yes.”	231.30141227316068
“It is surely not one of my friends?” replied D’Artagnan, affecting	203.71356923865065
hesitation in order to make her believe him ignorant.	187.21269374597864
“If it were one of your friends you would hesitate, then?” cried	268.76590370160875
Milady; and a threatening glance darted from her eyes.	188.86890109274037
“Not if it were my own brother!” cried D’Artagnan, as if carried away	222.17786841031275
by his enthusiasm.	253.85544275532567
Our Gascon promised this without risk, for he knew all that was meant.	334.84113136173715
“I love your devotedness,” said Milady.	239.69266034873007
“Alas, do you love nothing else in me?” asked D’Artagnan.	349.87918219522754
“I love you also, _you!_” said she, taking his hand.	212.87891180627298
The warm pressure made D’Artagnan tremble, as if by the touch that	306.2105031810239
fever which consumed Milady attacked himself.	298.25225920911566
“You love me, you!” cried he. “Oh, if that were so, I should lose my	360.378803348469
reason!”	185.32153280421966
And he folded her in his arms. She made no effort to remove her lips	179.2161523276359
from his kisses; only she did not respond to them. Her lips were cold;	317.11173768099445
it appeared to D’Artagnan that he had embraced a statue.	192.68062881788464
He was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love. He	175.10642930988053
almost believed in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the	317.754371701095
crime of De Wardes. If De Wardes had at that moment been under his	314.5736544623045
hand, he would have killed him.	356.597774215414
Milady seized the occasion.	218.4568827562117
“His name is—” said she, in her turn.	312.2943619325057
“De Wardes; I know it,” cried D’Artagnan.	261.4576851922949
“And how do you know it?” asked Milady, seizing both his hands, and	238.03467949210437
endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart.	217.84555492211462
D’Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he	300.9957767335944
had committed an error.	250.97169355087797
“Tell me, tell me, tell me, I say,” repeated Milady, “how do you know	242.4120520360146
it?”	322.4547789152515
“How do I know it?” said D’Artagnan.	206.887465990221
“Yes.”	348.0048835787478
“I know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I	283.3895114918426
was, showed a ring which he said he had received from you.”	307.39309377085567
“Wretch!” cried Milady.	171.40517840547545
The epithet, as may be easily understood, resounded to the very bottom	232.56869281092187
of D’Artagnan’s heart.	352.6387062018843
“Well?” continued she.	251.92116475694957
“Well, I will avenge you of this wretch,” replied D’Artagnan, giving	175.83788340774365
himself the airs of Don Japhet of Armenia.	365.806647128873
“Thanks, my brave friend!” cried Milady; “and when shall I be avenged?”	180.9252518826183
“Tomorrow—immediately—when you please!”	316.7030193351
Milady was about to cry out, “Immediately,” but she reflected that such	183.77711822912997
precipitation would not be very gracious toward D’Artagnan.	209.90589974158883
Besides, she had a thousand precautions to take, a thousand counsels to	290.5462102775961
give to her defender, in order that he might avoid explanations with	236.00912877454903
the count before witnesses. All this was answered by an expression of	351.5482360580328
D’Artagnan’s. “Tomorrow,” said he, “you will be avenged, or I shall be	287.50962596975336
dead.”	242.877386758768
“No,” said she, “you will avenge me; but you will not be dead. He is a	323.81472542809274
coward.”	327.3498401763284
“With women, perhaps; but not with men. I know something of him.”	255.45356354671506
“But it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in	332.89538765917064
your contest with him.”	326.3878241352728
“Fortune is a courtesan; favorable yesterday, she may turn her back	210.66594676135006
tomorrow.”	279.18193483172206
“Which means that you now hesitate?”	286.1773245745239
“No, I do not hesitate; God forbid! But would it be just to allow me to	295.32763402909666
go to a possible death without having given me at least something more	177.69620625702638
than hope?”	214.16957996173483
Milady answered by a glance which said, “Is that all?—speak, then.” And	319.2256361612142
then accompanying the glance with explanatory words, “That is but too	288.4183400876005
just,” said she, tenderly.	300.9437254668355
“Oh, you are an angel!” exclaimed the young man.	293.87859223517813
“Then all is agreed?” said she.	239.7482441507625
“Except that which I ask of you, dear love.”	215.2216624556852
“But when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?”	212.34862000670944
“I cannot wait till tomorrow.”	212.3671870061601
“Silence! I hear my brother. It will be useless for him to find you	252.93474194603283
here.”	324.5202666666256
She rang the bell and Kitty appeared.	214.71175649356422
“Go out this way,” said she, opening a small private door, “and come	305.03403588303615
back at eleven o’clock; we will then terminate this conversation. Kitty	280.7575854075857
will conduct you to my chamber.”	198.3967922027848
The poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words.	202.88361755828274
“Well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a	273.58927175347964
statue? Do as I bid you: show the chevalier out; and this evening at	243.95694742777775
eleven o’clock—you have heard what I said.”	273.42160708863383
“It appears that these appointments are all made for eleven o’clock,”	321.6291075607404
thought D’Artagnan; “that’s a settled custom.”	206.70207621353921
Milady held out her hand to him, which he kissed tenderly.	232.9270653429686
“But,” said he, as he retired as quickly as possible from the	320.77183497057746
reproaches of Kitty, “I must not play the fool. This woman is certainly	283.73454236767736
a great liar. I must take care.”	196.7279247730727
Chapter XXXVII.	309.5447786931836
MILADY’S SECRET	321.51508415340163
D’Artagnan left the hôtel instead of going up at once to Kitty’s	249.12255481361728
chamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do—and that for two	214.49879465114742
reasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches,	343.5057561082217
recriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to	256.7742531782958
have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if	234.57428793294508
possible, to fathom those of this woman.	216.30843594260278
What was most clear in the matter was that D’Artagnan loved Milady like	337.3427405866927
a madman, and that she did not love him at all. In an instant	177.12912481815417
D’Artagnan perceived that the best way in which he could act would be	170.8403719252499
to go home and write Milady a long letter, in which he would confess to	321.164632949846
her that he and De Wardes were, up to the present moment absolutely the	167.63083454061962
same, and that consequently he could not undertake, without committing	333.75572728303246
suicide, to kill the Comte de Wardes. But he also was spurred on by a	186.4931348015856
ferocious desire of vengeance. He wished to subdue this woman in his	219.51180334599695
own name; and as this vengeance appeared to him to have a certain	343.9420010414667
sweetness in it, he could not make up his mind to renounce it.	292.7803637473953
He walked six or seven times round the Place Royale, turning at every	167.03718057155086
ten steps to look at the light in Milady’s apartment, which was to be	340.02039661673274
seen through the blinds. It was evident that this time the young woman	200.38702512928347
was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the	325.9461320681331
first.	282.04013221103276
At length the light disappeared. With this light was extinguished the	295.51521536426117
last irresolution in the heart of D’Artagnan. He recalled to his mind	227.829047796154
the details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on	255.15695464711658
fire he re-entered the hôtel and flew toward Kitty’s chamber.	311.8293426406668
The poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to	185.6560149137645
delay her lover; but Milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the	234.80009005807494
noise D’Artagnan had made, and opening the door, said, “Come in.”	361.481491542443
All this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous	236.54086095221874
effrontery, that D’Artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what	363.08214138999097
he heard. He imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic	349.72913468852244
intrigues one meets in dreams. He, however, darted not the less quickly	336.5509746140907
toward Milady, yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone	183.76033942493774
exercises over iron.	273.96600536421016
As the door closed after them Kitty rushed toward it. Jealousy, fury,	326.39189989356447
offended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an	214.2373679420104
outraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she	218.45304014966374
reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having	244.39814421819872
assisted in such a machination, and above all, that D’Artagnan would	362.2155624163812
also be lost to her forever. This last thought of love counseled her to	323.4011156168147
make this last sacrifice.	194.06803605757747
D’Artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. It	335.3266900058004
was no longer a rival who was beloved; it was himself who was	302.71790016001137
apparently beloved. A secret voice whispered to him, at the bottom of	323.6432078240108
his heart, that he was but an instrument of vengeance, that he was only	298.5369146870354
caressed till he had given death; but pride, but self-love, but madness	292.79893610512295
silenced this voice and stifled its murmurs. And then our Gascon, with	284.89132615787173
that large quantity of conceit which we know he possessed, compared	224.39472419130854
himself with De Wardes, and asked himself why, after all, he should not	288.81952051559995
be beloved for himself?	345.36542735882085
He was absorbed entirely by the sensations of the moment. Milady was no	269.59697357659525
longer for him that woman of fatal intentions who had for a moment	195.46779048382467
terrified him; she was an ardent, passionate mistress, abandoning	307.4390768925755
herself to love which she also seemed to feel. Two hours thus glided	284.45644563511496
away. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who	208.70637327368968
had not the same motives for forgetfulness that D’Artagnan had, was the	274.78541270028643
first to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which	346.97228862149166
were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and De Wardes	224.33398087721758
were already arranged in his mind.	268.430980952964
But D’Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite another course, forgot	227.74031217563316
himself like a fool, and answered gallantly that it was too late to	360.955453857336
think about duels and sword thrusts.	296.415848229118
This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind	290.6543092395892
terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing.	206.69683982178847
Then D’Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible	205.70894721440482
duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed.	284.1376968404536
Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her	284.18052636804066
irresistible spirit and her iron will.	245.8703124793846
D’Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to	227.03215822571008
renounce, by pardoning De Wardes, the furious projects she had formed.	251.98895429592454
But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a	191.4438151795273
sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, “Are	209.12637167744256
you afraid, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan?”	260.2192596243294
“You cannot think so, dear love!” replied D’Artagnan; “but now, suppose	201.60246165197603
this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?”	357.80959529333734
“At all events,” said Milady, seriously, “he has deceived me, and from	239.37028231591233
the moment he deceived me, he merited death.”	276.96577785518457
“He shall die, then, since you condemn him!” said D’Artagnan, in so	214.5162340443743
firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion.	308.0830269124725
This reassured her.	310.8541149377302
We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but D’Artagnan	290.86846107848504
believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through	287.92019784607885
the window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing	196.0214347162554
D’Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge	205.12518422947585
her on the Comte de Wardes.	181.13632858755847
“I am quite ready,” said D’Artagnan; “but in the first place I should	174.1378243442825
like to be certain of one thing.”	210.5096564034923
“And what is that?” asked Milady.	169.41322184757445
“That is, whether you really love me?”	213.97824000896392
“I have given you proof of that, it seems to me.”	225.80868666100957
“And I am yours, body and soul!”	344.4548190927419
“Thanks, my brave lover; but as you are satisfied of my love, you must,	194.5435291510679
in your turn, satisfy me of yours. Is it not so?”	216.92658253390897
“Certainly; but if you love me as much as you say,” replied D’Artagnan,	220.077831613922
“do you not entertain a little fear on my account?”	350.27591461213524
“What have I to fear?”	243.5632739949815
“Why, that I may be dangerously wounded—killed even.”	292.6898829646739
“Impossible!” cried Milady, “you are such a valiant man, and such an	173.53613134619994
expert swordsman.”	266.9341771747295
“You would not, then, prefer a method,” resumed D’Artagnan, “which	281.4098527164128
would equally avenge you while rendering the combat useless?”	339.47258095237646
Milady looked at her lover in silence. The pale light of the first rays	324.55554207957823
of day gave to her clear eyes a strangely frightful expression.	358.28307704125615
“Really,” said she, “I believe you now begin to hesitate.”	332.8558511136454
“No, I do not hesitate; but I really pity this poor Comte de Wardes,	309.2572239633516
since you have ceased to love him. I think that a man must be so	196.7422211135438
severely punished by the loss of your love that he stands in need of no	176.45843358390164
other chastisement.”	300.86695919603244
“Who told you that I loved him?” asked Milady, sharply.	243.75371219830242
“At least, I am now at liberty to believe, without too much fatuity,	233.57805995121146
that you love another,” said the young man, in a caressing tone, “and I	278.51647118130904
repeat that I am really interested for the count.”	199.66674093130166
“You?” asked Milady.	181.5756471010576
“Yes, I.”	293.05691327846677
“And why _you?_”	218.92962443883354
“Because I alone know—”	331.04138375849305
“What?”	318.1167897702072
“That he is far from being, or rather having been, so guilty toward you	299.6771791419783
as he appears.”	246.6074735937973
“Indeed!” said Milady, in an anxious tone; “explain yourself, for I	220.8952378010892
really cannot tell what you mean.”	301.8836391251346
And she looked at D’Artagnan, who embraced her tenderly, with eyes	262.05428769303217
which seemed to burn themselves away.	224.75989235087786
“Yes; I am a man of honor,” said D’Artagnan, determined to come to an	311.439188884432
end, “and since your love is mine, and I am satisfied I possess it—for	221.00494181949207
I do possess it, do I not?”	212.773048330358
“Entirely; go on.”	191.8413424115121
“Well, I feel as if transformed—a confession weighs on my mind.”	173.57636606542462
“A confession!”	225.0547858577483
“If I had the least doubt of your love I would not make it, but you	174.29774065463073
love me, my beautiful mistress, do you not?”	266.0546437637668
“Without doubt.”	247.4056165695263
“Then if through excess of love I have rendered myself culpable toward	260.42520055803294
you, you will pardon me?”	181.45701044095662
“Perhaps.”	331.4337072217119
D’Artagnan tried with his sweetest smile to touch his lips to Milady’s,	184.8765358726189
but she evaded him.	169.82172262040532
“This confession,” said she, growing paler, “what is this confession?”	300.972222363692
“You gave De Wardes a meeting on Thursday last in this very room, did	232.10826193730742
you not?”	264.3184985510077
“No, no! It is not true,” said Milady, in a tone of voice so firm, and	222.47606228027672
with a countenance so unchanged, that if D’Artagnan had not been in	276.29947999383694
such perfect possession of the fact, he would have doubted.	275.2180351947095
“Do not lie, my angel,” said D’Artagnan, smiling; “that would be	297.5471654068423
useless.”	261.9911478587706
“What do you mean? Speak! you kill me.”	260.5083217155818
“Be satisfied; you are not guilty toward me, and I have already	270.76724348418685
pardoned you.”	314.72777332313626
“What next? what next?”	330.9058916250482
“De Wardes cannot boast of anything.”	222.46269165186646
“How is that? You told me yourself that that ring—”	286.88840293233307
“That ring I have! The Comte de Wardes of Thursday and the D’Artagnan	300.8733840145286
of today are the same person.”	303.49004935683774
The imprudent young man expected a surprise, mixed with shame—a slight	187.32533426166125
storm which would resolve itself into tears; but he was strangely	182.25735479666795
deceived, and his error was not of long duration.	303.5088441519415
Pale and trembling, Milady repulsed D’Artagnan’s attempted embrace by a	242.81964877079272
violent blow on the chest, as she sprang out of bed.	326.6408830426634
It was almost broad daylight.	194.9241838650183
D’Artagnan detained her by her night dress of fine India linen, to	327.49461022810044
implore her pardon; but she, with a strong movement, tried to escape.	242.79412897562727
Then the cambric was torn from her beautiful shoulders; and on one of	228.57061555369492
those lovely shoulders, round and white, D’Artagnan recognized, with	285.39525992455987
inexpressible astonishment, the _fleur-de-lis_—that indelible mark	187.26949984198234
which the hand of the infamous executioner had imprinted.	232.98445167322558
“Great God!” cried D’Artagnan, loosing his hold of her dress, and	286.8040704940623
remaining mute, motionless, and frozen.	295.9394910633697
But Milady felt herself denounced even by his terror. He had doubtless	191.82867362307758
seen all. The young man now knew her secret, her terrible secret—the	297.762611254385
secret she concealed even from her maid with such care, the secret of	202.11316113326558
which all the world was ignorant, except himself.	166.8250815067238
She turned upon him, no longer like a furious woman, but like a wounded	198.73943559111888
panther.	350.65085708384794
“Ah, wretch!” cried she, “you have basely betrayed me, and still more,	298.59774832099845
you have my secret! You shall die.”	177.502207534788
And she flew to a little inlaid casket which stood upon the dressing	288.74238572366363
table, opened it with a feverish and trembling hand, drew from it a	301.86559444118313
small poniard, with a golden haft and a sharp thin blade, and then	249.64304122755672
threw herself with a bound upon D’Artagnan.	254.33665677001846
Although the young man was brave, as we know, he was terrified at that	284.3652518679646
wild countenance, those terribly dilated pupils, those pale cheeks, and	196.89145850519884
those bleeding lips. He recoiled to the other side of the room as he	316.11926377197216
would have done from a serpent which was crawling toward him, and his	260.70941316115363
sword coming in contact with his nervous hand, he drew it almost	183.34796769890428
unconsciously from the scabbard. But without taking any heed of the	213.13624822868348
sword, Milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did	198.86582589194097
not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.	307.26912676898144
She then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but D’Artagnan kept	293.20498137331623
it free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her	231.68166508640337
eyes, sometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the	333.051042050678
bedstead, while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to	211.72815351856903
Kitty’s apartment.	361.55205728973704
Milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury,	222.59100800755152
screaming in a formidable way.	167.07245916023192
As all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, D’Artagnan began	215.51176246725828
to recover himself little by little.	258.26087436146383
“Well, beautiful lady, very well,” said he; “but, _pardieu_, if you	198.1552674592239
don’t calm yourself, I will design a second _fleur-de-lis_ upon one of	236.55274522522865
those pretty cheeks!”	309.55514950314375
“Scoundrel, infamous scoundrel!” howled Milady.	238.2860072666901
But D’Artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near to Kitty’s	279.81471708414034
door. At the noise they made, she in overturning the furniture in her	276.7709215389243
efforts to get at him, he in screening himself behind the furniture to	250.75484853567883
keep out of her reach, Kitty opened the door. D’Artagnan, who had	222.0613824874578
unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three	341.4470171390242
paces from it. With one spring he flew from the chamber of Milady into	251.43100656093014
that of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and	272.0911566506057
placed all his weight against it, while Kitty pushed the bolts.	167.57688595650148
Then Milady attempted to tear down the doorcase, with a strength	245.9431881982198
apparently above that of a woman; but finding she could not accomplish	308.06004073309805
this, she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard, the point	240.4547643652437
of which repeatedly glittered through the wood. Every blow was	189.83780124021712
accompanied with terrible imprecations.	318.7402891802524
“Quick, Kitty, quick!” said D’Artagnan, in a low voice, as soon as the	186.4105689835719
bolts were fast, “let me get out of the hôtel; for if we leave her time	283.489769054775
to turn round, she will have me killed by the servants.”	276.26348492347455
“But you can’t go out so,” said Kitty; “you are naked.”	241.8022206641083
“That’s true,” said D’Artagnan, then first thinking of the costume he	234.82107585016203
found himself in, “that’s true. But dress me as well as you are able,	209.8157469335407
only make haste; think, my dear girl, it’s life and death!”	216.16239772227806
Kitty was but too well aware of that. In a turn of the hand she muffled	258.98820214765834
him up in a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak. She gave him some	249.4146856163109
slippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him	249.36530258576997
down the stairs. It was time. Milady had already rung her bell, and	291.05872476388356
roused the whole hôtel. The porter was drawing the cord at the moment	177.1244772794337
Milady cried from her window, “Don’t open!”	264.0451146820427
The young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent	213.7125017035377
gesture. The moment she lost sight of him, Milady tumbled fainting into	238.9344951406606
her chamber.	278.4343046689029
Chapter XXXVIII.	259.50874536752116
HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT	337.24570340128275
D’Artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of	302.01740856343974
what might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and	177.43817710927283
did not stop till he came to Athos’s door. The confusion of his mind,	262.5685234907393
the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who	209.27064705069566
started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,	168.06053451088175
notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him	342.24371210633785
precipitate his course.	189.19263162622337
He crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos’s apartment, and	274.17905021098454
knocked at the door enough to break it down.	213.42743382541187
Grimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,	289.9232968950962
and D’Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to	365.11502610097745
overturn the astonished lackey.	353.86390892594693
In spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his	215.3595391121527
speech.	251.18720477235868
“Holloa, there!” cried he; “what do you want, you strumpet? What’s your	304.72718590295153
business here, you hussy?”	299.44998450913033
D’Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds	296.399261550829
of the cloak. At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor	355.9172405501767
devil perceived he had to deal with a man. He then concluded it must be	302.0884346463098
an assassin.	239.85010634396127
“Help! murder! help!” cried he.	304.3773301659038
“Hold your tongue, you stupid fellow!” said the young man; “I am	215.7822824174024
D’Artagnan; don’t you know me? Where is your master?”	286.8552444405957
“You, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried Grimaud, “impossible.”	202.3715845248709
“Grimaud,” said Athos, coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown,	240.12351038887104
“Grimaud, I thought I heard you permitting yourself to speak?”	330.0411792865069
“Ah, monsieur, it is—”	219.89729676902817
“Silence!”	312.0485523240985
Grimaud contented himself with pointing D’Artagnan out to his master	279.24074484451717
with his finger.	201.058715053123
Athos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into a	191.94405592084422
laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his	341.6096467431256
eyes—petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and	182.56486894372384
mustaches stiff with agitation.	265.98769903350694
“Don’t laugh, my friend!” cried D’Artagnan; “for heaven’s sake, don’t	230.74876987526733
laugh, for upon my soul, it’s no laughing matter!”	327.863318117744
And he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a	289.66733638011755
real appearance of terror, that Athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,	272.71262317591277
“Are you wounded, my friend? How pale you are!”	345.97494260407507
“No, but I have just met with a terrible adventure! Are you alone,	261.48092671443374
Athos?”	192.54024409879105
“_Parbleu!_ whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?”	308.2012291661404
“Well, well!” and D’Artagnan rushed into Athos’s chamber.	328.21157728951886
“Come, speak!” said the latter, closing the door and bolting it, that	320.4138736157097
they might not be disturbed. “Is the king dead? Have you killed the	263.34466962990683
cardinal? You are quite upset! Come, come, tell me; I am dying with	193.10096440797182
curiosity and uneasiness!”	332.34313137525555
“Athos,” said D’Artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and	349.78986654022714
appearing in his shirt, “prepare yourself to hear an incredible, an	253.39727082938657
unheard-of story.”	266.48596590952735
“Well, but put on this dressing gown first,” said the Musketeer to his	343.94578012585544
friend.	352.69561993813596
D’Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve	304.7617342018608
for the other, so greatly was he still agitated.	260.28562552862167
“Well?” said Athos.	190.60608366391142
“Well,” replied D’Artagnan, bending his mouth to Athos’s ear, and	231.61472321691144
lowering his voice, “Milady is marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ upon her	324.20424422250926
shoulder!”	256.09571032542954
“Ah!” cried the Musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart.	311.24977033048924
“Let us see,” said D’Artagnan. “Are you _sure_ that the _other_ is	334.01661908006736
dead?”	338.88427444842046
“_The other?_” said Athos, in so stifled a voice that D’Artagnan	201.45640441053575
scarcely heard him.	348.0651185004292
“Yes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.”	313.76759193008525
Athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.	365.5966979949743
“This is a woman of twenty-six or twenty-eight years.”	281.4179437361834
“Fair,” said Athos, “is she not?”	316.7685141101568
“Very.”	199.62565631248538
“Blue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and	325.37125888423566
eyebrows?”	246.20350897077668
“Yes.”	216.96562671861273
“Tall, well-made? She has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the	263.8893303558175
left?”	181.12600641092996
“Yes.”	204.4744843650167
“The _fleur-de-lis_ is small, rosy in color, and looks as if efforts	171.5017163890204
had been made to efface it by the application of poultices?”	191.91637369608102
“Yes.”	259.3869198317164
“But you say she is English?”	223.268702906626
“She is called Milady, but she may be French. Lord de Winter is only	221.19991636159614
her brother-in-law.”	235.96424770976463
“I will see her, D’Artagnan!”	218.3669452431089
“Beware, Athos, beware. You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return	276.85365145166816
you the like, and not to fail.”	306.77265589901947
“She will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself.”	203.40579595984718
“She is capable of anything or everything. Did you ever see her	325.2245264978419
furious?”	330.0832843341315
“No,” said Athos.	258.86283167167187
“A tigress, a panther! Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have	354.2759572742341
drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!”	348.0292311812453
D’Artagnan then related all—the mad passion of Milady and her menaces	323.42670957577195
of death.	318.253900993016
“You are right; and upon my soul, I would give my life for a hair,”	217.12820176389812
said Athos. “Fortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave Paris. We are	339.03454189866966
going according to all probability to La Rochelle, and once gone—”	342.6059390057869
“She will follow you to the end of the world, Athos, if she recognizes	285.86141811178294
you. Let her, then, exhaust her vengeance on me alone!”	219.51847009776924
“My dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?” said	351.4815427329291
Athos. “Do you, perchance, think I set any great store by life?”	319.4590564461297
“There is something horribly mysterious under all this, Athos; this	312.1795700279567
woman is one of the cardinal’s spies, I am sure of that.”	243.7988517891862
“In that case, take care! If the cardinal does not hold you in high	231.8569554052666
admiration for the affair of London, he entertains a great hatred for	331.8105195502634
you; but as, considering everything, he cannot accuse you openly, and	343.6880913544062
as hatred must be satisfied, particularly when it’s a cardinal’s	177.84117897665647
hatred, take care of yourself. If you go out, do not go out alone; when	218.5747247008265
you eat, use every precaution. Mistrust everything, in short, even your	262.1477625807556
own shadow.”	262.7905252974965
“Fortunately,” said D’Artagnan, “all this will be only necessary till	205.75328649994964
after tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, I	303.4258826631587
hope, only men to dread.”	202.44860490474827
“In the meantime,” said Athos, “I renounce my plan of seclusion, and	346.8529423253182
wherever you go, I will go with you. You must return to the Rue des	284.23127874531076
Fossoyeurs; I will accompany you.”	230.21075649086012
“But however near it may be,” replied D’Artagnan, “I cannot go thither	181.58133437531671
in this guise.”	358.7103372100021
“That’s true,” said Athos, and he rang the bell.	291.7004177662729
Grimaud entered.	209.2648534324769
Athos made him a sign to go to D’Artagnan’s residence, and bring back	268.11232024916245
some clothes. Grimaud replied by another sign that he understood	252.4448072393007
perfectly, and set off.	230.21436994795556
“All this will not advance your outfit,” said Athos; “for if I am not	323.0383175733
mistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with Milady, and she	318.5055031309316
will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you.	269.4464832778757
Fortunately, you have the sapphire.”	269.0453057751932
“The jewel is yours, my dear Athos! Did you not tell me it was a family	267.6804063072683
jewel?”	304.31904796699916
“Yes, my grandfather gave two thousand crowns for it, as he once told	278.5456208966541
me. It formed part of the nuptial present he made his wife, and it is	341.9066567241112
magnificent. My mother gave it to me, and I, fool as I was, instead of	223.75987207985742
keeping the ring as a holy relic, gave it to this wretch.”	270.50366736076205
“Then, my friend, take back this ring, to which I see you attach much	348.0019586850501
value.”	231.3430674541737
“I take back the ring, after it has passed through the hands of that	186.3089564808497
infamous creature? Never; that ring is defiled, D’Artagnan.”	219.92102453160442
“Sell it, then.”	361.2614850179356
“Sell a jewel which came from my mother! I vow I should consider it a	236.3273130858592
profanation.”	284.5274794152886
“Pledge it, then; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it. With	292.46699387115723
that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and	363.20901277310463
when you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back	192.50806349681304
cleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the	188.41708060758646
hands of usurers.”	308.0579030007865
Athos smiled.	300.63866183848256
“You are a capital companion, D’Artagnan,” said he; “your never-failing	301.36021323562125
cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. Well, let us pledge the	295.55224825028097
ring, but upon one condition.”	299.52512636343454
“What?”	288.8048461283945
“That there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred	280.20271262724674
crowns for me.”	201.10285735777836
“Don’t dream it, Athos. I don’t need the quarter of such a sum—I who am	352.0549036271716
still only in the Guards—and by selling my saddles, I shall procure it.	198.16193243814132
What do I want? A horse for Planchet, that’s all. Besides, you forget	264.6687875869012
that I have a ring likewise.”	207.17462620266033
“To which you attach more value, it seems, than I do to mine; at least,	272.3825439153358
I have thought so.”	308.58413497038305
“Yes, for in any extreme circumstance it might not only extricate us	200.7521243085894
from some great embarrassment, but even a great danger. It is not only	266.3941430455294
a valuable diamond, but it is an enchanted talisman.”	298.2150374495218
“I don’t at all understand you, but I believe all you say to be true.	353.67776473475965
Let us return to my ring, or rather to yours. You shall take half the	342.5095654241121
sum that will be advanced upon it, or I will throw it into the Seine;	255.98476167327686
and I doubt, as was the case with Polycrates, whether any fish will be	175.7882825266891
sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us.”	180.26788030959852
“Well, I will take it, then,” said D’Artagnan.	271.21076634178974
At this moment Grimaud returned, accompanied by Planchet; the latter,	259.8860135911912
anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,	222.713448391614
had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments	346.858499960414
himself.	170.20090564132124
D’Artagnan dressed himself, and Athos did the same. When the two were	296.9071772129963
ready to go out, the latter made Grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,	241.44676322067534
and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to	217.857989490448
follow his master.	227.97918821897707
They arrived without accident at the Rue des Fossoyeurs. Bonacieux was	314.4235404736182
standing at the door, and looked at D’Artagnan hatefully.	202.2607155478905
“Make haste, dear lodger,” said he; “there is a very pretty girl	220.65698261876463
waiting for you upstairs; and you know women don’t like to be kept	175.76987284615257
waiting.”	299.7648686491981
“That’s Kitty!” said D’Artagnan to himself, and darted into the	184.74712634661574
passage.	364.9485917612685
Sure enough! Upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching	227.81546654917835
against the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble. As soon as	357.32493544312877
she perceived him, she cried, “You have promised your protection; you	184.27852969357554
have promised to save me from her anger. Remember, it is you who have	219.15006039250582
ruined me!”	330.3530260097789
“Yes, yes, to be sure, Kitty,” said D’Artagnan; “be at ease, my girl.	357.78329913737707
But what happened after my departure?”	303.886552311445
“How can I tell!” said Kitty. “The lackeys were brought by the cries	362.300877151894
she made. She was mad with passion. There exist no imprecations she did	234.32744943030468
not pour out against you. Then I thought she would remember it was	251.83638089058527
through my chamber you had penetrated hers, and that then she would	296.7219811702111
suppose I was your accomplice; so I took what little money I had and	218.327439762102
the best of my things, and I got away.	301.29847033248444
“Poor dear girl! But what can I do with you? I am going away the day	357.8669133830525
after tomorrow.”	233.1522847908426
“Do what you please, Monsieur Chevalier. Help me out of Paris; help me	344.731376714761
out of France!”	250.75367150667708
“I cannot take you, however, to the siege of La Rochelle,” said	190.33426829075734
D’Artagnan.	190.94172593757796
“No; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of	186.52460071485706
your acquaintance—in your own country, for instance.”	213.77043499081577
“My dear little love! In my country the ladies do without chambermaids.	334.3741361030028
But stop! I can manage your business for you. Planchet, go and find	275.72146183211146
Aramis. Request him to come here directly. We have something very	212.9170554958523
important to say to him.”	297.7583843128016
“I understand,” said Athos; “but why not Porthos? I should have thought	351.7312744517737
that his duchess—”	215.2402877454638
“Oh, Porthos’s duchess is dressed by her husband’s clerks,” said	286.5431706117886
D’Artagnan, laughing. “Besides, Kitty would not like to live in the Rue	363.21964283051113
aux Ours. Isn’t it so, Kitty?”	280.5334608136046
“I do not care where I live,” said Kitty, “provided I am well	215.68684037230992
concealed, and nobody knows where I am.”	174.88867017170344
“Meanwhile, Kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer	176.50249957758604
jealous of me—”	352.7764163952696
“Monsieur Chevalier, far off or near,” said Kitty, “I shall always love	305.6980467451536
you.”	209.14612030547707
“Where the devil will constancy niche itself next?” murmured Athos.	356.5297426862586
“And I, also,” said D’Artagnan, “I also. I shall always love you; be	327.5159310417773
sure of that. But now answer me. I attach great importance to the	187.81813799768128
question I am about to put to you. Did you never hear talk of a young	364.9359528027772
woman who was carried off one night?”	206.41690987823512
“There, now! Oh, Monsieur Chevalier, do you love that woman still?”	208.33767553134518
“No, no; it is one of my friends who loves her—Monsieur Athos, this	275.97144325577113
gentleman here.”	283.82615488470924
“I?” cried Athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is	197.814158639881
about to tread upon an adder.	211.1654205799186
“You, to be sure!” said D’Artagnan, pressing Athos’s hand. “You know	278.82209651350195
the interest we both take in this poor little Madame Bonacieux.	341.65748101980387
Besides, Kitty will tell nothing; will you, Kitty? You understand, my	347.91911799571767
dear girl,” continued D’Artagnan, “she is the wife of that frightful	317.724263517426
baboon you saw at the door as you came in.”	287.5010714400799
“Oh, my God! You remind me of my fright! If he should have known me	168.60155144886522
again!”	214.73276976367248
“How? know you again? Did you ever see that man before?”	336.5046683599832
“He came twice to Milady’s.”	324.3535272819912
“That’s it. About what time?”	194.41475946421554
“Why, about fifteen or eighteen days ago.”	318.3193429495054
“Exactly so.”	262.5143077525802
“And yesterday evening he came again.”	217.70523722127282
“Yesterday evening?”	355.6012606296423
“Yes, just before you came.”	363.9729053237962
“My dear Athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. And do you	195.95960413893556
believe he knew you again, Kitty?”	177.56294517868426
“I pulled down my hood as soon as I saw him, but perhaps it was too	323.29034504994763
late.”	171.45480530744567
“Go down, Athos—he mistrusts you less than me—and see if he be still at	310.29207246512397
his door.”	250.81133808458713
Athos went down and returned immediately.	279.3833150119916
“He has gone,” said he, “and the house door is shut.”	328.31836698445136
“He has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at	278.83177434402194
this moment in the dovecot.”	167.08861890339003
“Well, then, let us all fly,” said Athos, “and leave nobody here but	191.92420891329272
Planchet to bring us news.”	169.3057006754778
“A minute. Aramis, whom we have sent for!”	260.4380214129446
“That’s true,” said Athos; “we must wait for Aramis.”	328.3397989842989
At that moment Aramis entered.	294.2438119973241
The matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to	296.9191916116673
understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for	266.1074736118794
Kitty.	234.70122047434054
Aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, “Will it be	239.1671747813623
really rendering you a service, D’Artagnan?”	313.09523077528866
“I shall be grateful to you all my life.”	346.5499526365856
“Very well. Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who	344.35629110386833
resides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid. If you	354.54657535548125
can, my dear D’Artagnan, answer for Mademoiselle—”	266.2826872659533
“Oh, monsieur, be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the	177.83835090823771
person who will give me the means of quitting Paris.”	253.33233469707
“Then,” said Aramis, “this falls out very well.”	218.95320827737936
He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed	286.5009721927102
with a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty.	293.8311650520008
“And now, my dear girl,” said D’Artagnan, “you know that it is not good	182.5936323695788
for any of us to be here. Therefore let us separate. We shall meet	358.3410271841809
again in better days.”	169.80073923646447
“And whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be,” said	181.8654285962969
Kitty, “you will find me loving you as I love you today.”	346.5498864826477
“Dicers’ oaths!” said Athos, while D’Artagnan went to conduct Kitty	239.13904011959323
downstairs.	203.56369392898785
An instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet	302.51261440412065
again at four o’clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the	289.23962713279155
house.	203.39310592626072
Aramis returned home, and Athos and D’Artagnan busied themselves about	176.57063213766185
pledging the sapphire.	220.96790883239868
As the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles	301.12824140333885
on the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell	346.8414508089024
it to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he	171.9993120846659
would give five hundred pistoles for it.	331.4106713578917
Athos and D’Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the	171.55564908743384
knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase	350.16740820839465
the entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy,	173.72137049708263
and a noble to his fingers’ ends. When a thing suited him he paid the	334.9161105242233
price demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. D’Artagnan	308.2233685337046
would have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his	306.11355781110547
shoulder, with a smile, and D’Artagnan understood that it was all very	343.25754645642166
well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain,	317.96886192010425
but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince. The Musketeer met	175.31499259289345
with a superb Andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs	220.91355352422485
clean and elegant, rising six years. He examined him, and found him	294.7885805983563
sound and without blemish. They asked a thousand livres for him.	233.21725590259763
He might perhaps have been bought for less; but while D’Artagnan was	321.94054606901585
discussing the price with the dealer, Athos was counting out the money	210.2923463799843
on the table.	244.63478802443385
Grimaud had a stout, short Picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.	184.21970193494798
But when the saddle and arms for Grimaud were purchased, Athos had not	290.9169099095877
a sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles. D’Artagnan offered his	223.76461441124292
friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient.	313.9228598499049
But Athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.	314.60276158805664
“How much did the Jew say he would give for the sapphire if he	301.316293124285
purchased it?” said Athos.	260.6101030890549
“Five hundred pistoles.”	241.2226373343833
“That is to say, two hundred more—a hundred pistoles for you and a	346.2469148384722
hundred pistoles for me. Well, now, that would be a real fortune to us,	189.63425792845695
my friend; let us go back to the Jew’s again.”	329.8534975565103
“What! will you—”	282.344886495388
“This ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then	264.71301584459013
we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so	260.0510282991037
that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain. Go and	269.7465874012403
tell him the ring is his, D’Artagnan, and bring back the two hundred	273.6654748727072
pistoles with you.”	355.08387181617434
“Reflect, Athos!”	263.4989064384278
“Ready money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to	237.44464998901267
make sacrifices. Go, D’Artagnan, go; Grimaud will accompany you with	352.4888110615361
his musketoon.”	292.4040888006674
A half hour afterward, D’Artagnan returned with the two thousand	256.889252194445
livres, and without having met with any accident.	216.08193521841542
It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect.	307.8646217935528
Chapter XXXIX.	317.51295221444553
A VISION	183.83843794390913
At four o’clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos. Their	248.69092096984832
anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance	351.61845964196004
only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet—for behind all	261.1723456818119
present happiness is concealed a fear for the future.	176.99705409447182
Suddenly Planchet entered, bringing two letters for D’Artagnan.	168.78338706811562
The one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in	290.21306785319507
green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch.	182.0915569070271
The other was a large square epistle, resplendent with the terrible	285.98153310275643
arms of his Eminence the cardinal duke.	319.79640521429457
At the sight of the little letter the heart of D’Artagnan bounded, for	207.4897339483261
he believed he recognized the handwriting, and although he had seen	256.1679474909498
that writing but once, the memory of it remained at the bottom of his	185.61307270721218
heart.	215.74654150196045
He therefore seized the little epistle, and opened it eagerly.	217.38080191129797
“Be,” said the letter, “on Thursday next, at from six to seven o’clock	195.97645429699884
in the evening, on the road to Chaillot, and look carefully into the	169.05080699008607
carriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own	344.68264317929186
life or that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not	349.91883070881653
make a movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized	242.75622546279257
her who exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but	166.10837816392728
for an instant.”	286.44230196204865
No signature.	197.12532435686762
“That’s a snare,” said Athos; “don’t go, D’Artagnan.”	277.85919642010884
“And yet,” replied D’Artagnan, “I think I recognize the writing.”	207.49368495280603
“It may be counterfeit,” said Athos. “Between six and seven o’clock the	241.62028885253454
road of Chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in	285.6947391081592
the forest of Bondy.”	305.0289124609377
“But suppose we all go,” said D’Artagnan; “what the devil! They won’t	174.47346223384454
devour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!”	228.78597162271438
“And besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,”	278.6640720456749
said Porthos.	293.1621750049867
“But if it is a woman who writes,” said Aramis, “and that woman desires	345.095272527779
not to be seen, remember, you compromise her, D’Artagnan; which is not	339.9852411414709
the part of a gentleman.”	339.9831213851211
“We will remain in the background,” said Porthos, “and he will advance	362.20422840661126
alone.”	228.04052078007155
“Yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a	240.92033884389798
gallop.”	265.50935936214546
“Bah!” said D’Artagnan, “they will miss me; if they fire we will ride	269.02749023527497
after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. They must	267.98708805621885
be enemies.”	200.85566618059391
“He is right,” said Porthos; “battle. Besides, we must try our own	202.88721502186866
arms.”	334.92117213298536
“Bah, let us enjoy that pleasure,” said Aramis, with his mild and	337.40948125963564
careless manner.	174.92503368378968
“As you please,” said Athos.	247.0653087664233
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “it is half past four, and we have	230.55544474930403
scarcely time to be on the road of Chaillot by six.”	235.63316007364267
“Besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us,” said Porthos,	195.0655579377771
“and that will be a pity. Let us get ready, gentlemen.”	270.9518336761521
“But this second letter,” said Athos, “you forget that; it appears to	271.61246508604387
me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. For	227.86888264846212
my part, I declare, D’Artagnan, I think it of much more consequence	239.3747311525993
than the little piece of waste paper you have so cunningly slipped into	218.96240975854346
your bosom.”	318.0979022621375
D’Artagnan blushed.	305.28489572509477
“Well,” said he, “let us see, gentlemen, what are his Eminence’s	363.75543578013924
commands,” and D’Artagnan unsealed the letter and read,	187.44467492130076
“M. d’Artagnan, of the king’s Guards, company Dessessart, is expected	178.98958914507213
at the Palais-Cardinal this evening, at eight o’clock.	173.5028410912279
“LA HOUDINIERE, _Captain of the Guards_”	274.19281046934384
“The devil!” said Athos; “here’s a rendezvous much more serious than	169.1466142059315
the other.”	208.74942839183544
“I will go to the second after attending the first,” said D’Artagnan.	181.0981985603516
“One is for seven o’clock, and the other for eight; there will be time	284.88895062179427
for both.”	193.88950154136893
“Hum! I would not go at all,” said Aramis. “A gallant knight cannot	356.0162822932751
decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse	326.99971141686046
himself from not waiting on his Eminence, particularly when he has	200.6118351925823
reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments.”	184.97015069264648
“I am of Aramis’s opinion,” said Porthos.	250.2282882529201
“Gentlemen,” replied D’Artagnan, “I have already received by Monsieur	329.09884970161903
de Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence. I neglected it, and	321.4817891897149
on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me—Constance	193.75323761574344
disappeared. Whatever may ensue, I will go.”	358.2686135187114
“If you are determined,” said Athos, “do so.”	280.5255027974639
“But the Bastille?” said Aramis.	246.25358922200374
“Bah! you will get me out if they put me there,” said D’Artagnan.	174.56379961210948
“To be sure we will,” replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable	248.72343204968007
promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the	305.0609879223848
world, “to be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set	302.9319658328224
off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this	189.8662485599807
Bastille.”	343.35602826160937
“Let us do better than that,” said Athos; “do not let us leave him	229.1222378325154
during the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace	324.286625970546
with three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all	244.8603397009529
suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long	184.05686113071013
time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the	181.27574792980425
Cardinal; Monsieur de Tréville must think us dead.”	211.2583828579075
“To a certainty, Athos,” said Aramis, “you were meant to be a general	270.05511909472705
of the army! What do you think of the plan, gentlemen?”	201.43660114188194
“Admirable!” replied the young men in chorus.	282.1885649961177
“Well,” said Porthos, “I will run to the hôtel, and engage our comrades	337.613557314509
to hold themselves in readiness by eight o’clock; the rendezvous, the	265.10212593828373
Place du Palais-Cardinal. Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the	184.63724059826245
horses.”	230.4125246942396
“I have no horse,” said D’Artagnan; “but that is of no consequence, I	305.71522654160185
can take one of Monsieur de Tréville’s.”	169.88214811545998
“That is not worth while,” said Aramis, “you can have one of mine.”	302.55218259968285
“One of yours! how many have you, then?” asked D’Artagnan.	340.63503623461474
“Three,” replied Aramis, smiling.	173.9490626274018
“_Certes_,” cried Athos, “you are the best-mounted poet of France or	213.36826206032202
Navarre.”	321.39234031420733
“Well, my dear Aramis, you don’t want three horses? I cannot comprehend	335.99909508885406
what induced you to buy three!”	274.7621742302646
“Therefore I only purchased two,” said Aramis.	168.9442247631123
“The third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?”	341.3318007781188
“No, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of	228.76048091284557
livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he	330.62953582094195
had received orders from his master.”	237.43434358966758
“Or his mistress,” interrupted D’Artagnan.	182.37369933718733
“That makes no difference,” said Aramis, coloring; “and who affirmed,	212.85053788827423
as I said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to	320.40770780372605
place the horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came.”	265.4078495774804
“It is only to poets that such things happen,” said Athos, gravely.	180.92997679200198
“Well, in that case, we can manage famously,” said D’Artagnan; “which	341.9960568502226
of the two horses will you ride—that which you bought or the one that	316.99789055066503
was given to you?”	228.6867893058415
“That which was given to me, assuredly. You cannot for a moment	299.28953635212326
imagine, D’Artagnan, that I would commit such an offense toward—”	181.09934175142683
“The unknown giver,” interrupted D’Artagnan.	273.6711995569856
“Or the mysterious benefactress,” said Athos.	280.33761486578896
“The one you bought will then become useless to you?”	274.0880995012475
“Nearly so.”	220.64569411730398
“And you selected it yourself?”	339.10440938503103
“With the greatest care. The safety of the horseman, you know, depends	241.2580284888635
almost always upon the goodness of his horse.”	198.0385590048079
“Well, transfer it to me at the price it cost you?”	267.58194953704424
“I was going to make you the offer, my dear D’Artagnan, giving you all	268.0706120725244
the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle.”	275.6402194405322
“How much did it cost you?”	173.41858354055643
“Eight hundred livres.”	259.993285851339
“Here are forty double pistoles, my dear friend,” said D’Artagnan,	315.4398175813337
taking the sum from his pocket; “I know that is the coin in which you	167.72194744636585
were paid for your poems.”	254.8182518689872
“You are rich, then?” said Aramis.	275.0725590130536
“Rich? Richest, my dear fellow!”	191.99909600875765
And D’Artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.	260.4884786774635
“Send your saddle, then, to the hôtel of the Musketeers, and your horse	242.44259317924016
can be brought back with ours.”	197.50174424178266
“Very well; but it is already five o’clock, so make haste.”	302.0843442630403
A quarter of an hour afterward Porthos appeared at the end of the Rue	267.90568819574025
Férou on a very handsome _genet_. Mousqueton followed him upon an	227.17608052817593
Auvergne horse, small but very handsome. Porthos was resplendent with	266.3833314824511
joy and pride.	299.58594145707053
At the same time, Aramis made his appearance at the other end of the	334.31285679789966
street upon a superb English charger. Bazin followed him upon a roan,	317.46171570436104
holding by the halter a vigorous Mecklenburg horse; this was	210.33275193793247
D’Artagnan’s mount.	333.992863378586
The two Musketeers met at the gate. Athos and D’Artagnan watched their	293.41165993297693
approach from the window.	242.60983961311507
“The devil!” cried Aramis, “you have a magnificent horse there,	248.41797802458106
Porthos.”	305.7466632578396
“Yes,” replied Porthos, “it is the one that ought to have been sent to	287.4144554350595
me at first. A bad joke of the husband’s substituted the other; but the	200.95639690953857
husband has been punished since, and I have obtained full	259.5768291604344
satisfaction.”	184.26293147248876
Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters’	361.82496715141724
steeds. D’Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their	289.26079515475453
companions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a	178.94631389921778
woman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he	315.9848549705001
owed to his procurator’s wife, and D’Artagnan on a horse he owed to his	295.53837913560494
good fortune—the best mistress possible.	306.08920043223213
The lackeys followed.	353.2396815073568
As Porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if	284.9696903835233
Mme. Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he	291.4513977923009
made upon his handsome Spanish _genet_, she would not have regretted	309.64008922212
the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband.	179.2832522804342
Near the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Tréville, who was	337.4005212929403
returning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments	166.27092932378983
upon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred	305.9505531065556
gapers.	360.2343210775557
D’Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Tréville of	201.68624527273423
the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal’s arms. It is well	298.03637243635075
understood that he did not breathe a word about the other.	246.02823370347565
M. de Tréville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured	260.50394269943195
him that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake	247.29760374812562
to find him, let him be where he might.	309.1207854621588
At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six; the four friends	294.54482615443686
pleaded an engagement, and took leave of M. de Tréville.	241.0783899847325
A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to	216.95192063551377
decline, carriages were passing and repassing. D’Artagnan, keeping at	277.26161849433464
some distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every	168.8382203271923
carriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted.	324.3784102461379
At length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was	302.36535616321794
beginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on	297.5638467500669
the road of Sèvres. A presentiment instantly told D’Artagnan that this	335.58553128088374
carriage contained the person who had appointed the rendezvous; the	245.47107831043337
young man was himself astonished to find his heart beat so violently.	244.89627066879783
Almost instantly a female head was put out at the window, with two	189.54189978554518
fingers placed upon her mouth, either to enjoin silence or to send him	270.3312653488285
a kiss. D’Artagnan uttered a slight cry of joy; this woman, or rather	222.08199153428268
this apparition—for the carriage passed with the rapidity of a	177.9499522756689
vision—was Mme. Bonacieux.	311.40882452103176
By an involuntary movement and in spite of the injunction given,	218.32705338067575
D’Artagnan put his horse into a gallop, and in a few strides overtook	273.30198223909616
the carriage; but the window was hermetically closed, the vision had	204.45266107888375
disappeared.	215.3529390725581
D’Artagnan then remembered the injunction: “If you value your own life	244.13862701298945
or that of those who love you, remain motionless, and as if you had	317.6905819517773
seen nothing.”	325.14974496668714
He stopped, therefore, trembling not for himself but for the poor woman	289.38644253274714
who had evidently exposed herself to great danger by appointing this	318.5932642426286
rendezvous.	225.86678054251354
The carriage pursued its way, still going at a great pace, till it	234.9307689339468
dashed into Paris, and disappeared.	195.0682098955186
D’Artagnan remained fixed to the spot, astounded and not knowing what	214.24096815565179
to think. If it was Mme. Bonacieux and if she was returning to Paris,	249.56620828317747
why this fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why	281.83529854148617
this lost kiss? If, on the other side, it was not she—which was still	295.51830982269814
quite possible—for the little light that remained rendered a mistake	213.64675795255891
easy—might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through	317.6855393629676
the allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?	291.9147328388866
His three companions joined him. All had plainly seen a woman’s head	166.36854259062005
appear at the window, but none of them, except Athos, knew Mme.	274.4170730197866
Bonacieux. The opinion of Athos was that it was indeed she; but less	222.8022838581481
preoccupied by that pretty face than D’Artagnan, he had fancied he saw	187.20597709868093
a second head, a man’s head, inside the carriage.	275.9999127350548
“If that be the case,” said D’Artagnan, “they are doubtless	174.35836453387063
transporting her from one prison to another. But what can they intend	319.34823650990256
to do with the poor creature, and how shall I ever meet her again?”	316.3134670288191
“Friend,” said Athos, gravely, “remember that it is the dead alone with	215.13201857431795
whom we are not likely to meet again on this earth. You know something	214.6055646894269
of that, as well as I do, I think. Now, if your mistress is not dead,	321.34450651054647
if it is she we have just seen, you will meet with her again some day	288.8511042536039
or other. And perhaps, my God!” added he, with that misanthropic tone	356.94153263336455
which was peculiar to him, “perhaps sooner than you wish.”	344.3340696118116
Half past seven had sounded. The carriage had been twenty minutes	238.058570451144
behind the time appointed. D’Artagnan’s friends reminded him that he	279.1886215869073
had a visit to pay, but at the same time bade him observe that there	355.39289724887715
was yet time to retract.	198.09937281439963
But D’Artagnan was at the same time impetuous and curious. He had made	241.6767295006848
up his mind that he would go to the Palais-Cardinal, and that he would	309.9789563282775
learn what his Eminence had to say to him. Nothing could turn him from	172.4095382292253
his purpose.	216.34637598412343
They reached the Rue St. Honoré, and in the Place du Palais-Cardinal	211.31057779952354
they found the twelve invited Musketeers, walking about in expectation	288.2091385723676
of their comrades. There only they explained to them the matter in	355.93776815325833
hand.	229.17847562262307
D’Artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king’s	167.98705139783672
Musketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he	313.90965335211376
was considered beforehand as a comrade. It resulted from these	328.1332631435595
antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which	237.00492595382693
they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an	319.065242952615
opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,	276.7079768653659
and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.	181.19560964743644
Athos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave	219.50926049126346
the second to Aramis, and the third to Porthos; and then each group	313.2911534988243
went and took their watch near an entrance.	204.5115104357265
D’Artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.	307.7935957032711
Although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without	286.3778025061279
a little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step.	332.79434685306927
His conduct toward Milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and	253.88666118120352
he was very suspicious of the political relations which existed between	182.33352869031805
that woman and the cardinal. Still further, De Wardes, whom he had	348.3839748428907
treated so ill, was one of the tools of his Eminence; and D’Artagnan	216.45616027229232
knew that while his Eminence was terrible to his enemies, he was	190.98833842867094
strongly attached to his friends.	345.0680396285899
“If De Wardes has related all our affair to the cardinal, which is not	351.4661679631406
to be doubted, and if he has recognized me, as is probable, I may	354.5748146253245
consider myself almost as a condemned man,” said D’Artagnan, shaking	345.7776299182752
his head. “But why has he waited till now? That’s all plain enough.	180.4737472842857
Milady has laid her complaints against me with that hypocritical grief	169.54399215177853
which renders her so interesting, and this last offense has made the	348.17003554383973
cup overflow.”	214.92637067530407
“Fortunately,” added he, “my good friends are down yonder, and they	234.91342198945685
will not allow me to be carried away without a struggle. Nevertheless,	268.1522813791261
Monsieur de Tréville’s company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a	243.9498271273456
war against the cardinal, who disposes of the forces of all France, and	304.4422681918344
before whom the queen is without power and the king without will.	206.66666160662677
D’Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have	188.16594470335028
excellent qualities; but the women will ruin you!”	232.82522355214235
He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber. He	185.69488145456023
placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty, who led him into	268.09922487206194
the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace.	206.633481663264
In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinal’s Guards, who	316.0277878124755
recognized D’Artagnan, and knowing that it was he who had wounded	244.709971649397
Jussac, they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning.	207.8225755083223
This smile appeared to D’Artagnan to be of bad augury. Only, as our	351.0460697346136
Gascon was not easily intimidated—or rather, thanks to a great pride	212.4217918365581
natural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to see	347.92841036782033
what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all	231.55739780721612
resembled fear—he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the	254.24705848855302
Guards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means	251.87393284706806
deficient in majesty.	222.8543265342982
The usher returned and made a sign to D’Artagnan to follow him. It	304.6047692121176
appeared to the young man that the Guards, on seeing him depart,	249.83590625665445
chuckled among themselves.	176.56660312620295
He traversed a corridor, crossed a grand saloon, entered a library, and	340.25836383188505
found himself in the presence of a man seated at a desk and writing.	312.9521502070967
The usher introduced him, and retired without speaking a word.	271.2392695878122
D’Artagnan remained standing and examined this man.	288.74261052405683
D’Artagnan at first believed that he had to do with some judge	350.64176674897783
examining his papers; but he perceived that the man at the desk wrote,	298.15264121007937
or rather corrected, lines of unequal length, scanning the words on his	239.04174812160994
fingers. He saw then that he was with a poet. At the end of an instant	324.67872296652024
the poet closed his manuscript, upon the cover of which was written	296.338270456784
“Mirame, a Tragedy in Five Acts,” and raised his head.	179.77866135567686
D’Artagnan recognized the cardinal.	246.48873126679976
Chapter XL.	294.38947103711297
A TERRIBLE VISION	322.21161754013406
The cardinal leaned his elbow on his manuscript, his cheek upon his	257.3656947981791
hand, and looked intently at the young man for a moment. No one had a	272.81234272698896
more searching eye than the Cardinal de Richelieu, and D’Artagnan felt	185.55433719416266
this glance run through his veins like a fever.	299.75104058363115
He however kept a good countenance, holding his hat in his hand and	185.10953077177652
awaiting the good pleasure of his Eminence, without too much assurance,	289.63592860092507
but also without too much humility.	360.8801041586331
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “are you a D’Artagnan from Béarn?”	317.0888373262035
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the young man.	182.6600441749938
“There are several branches of the D’Artagnans at Tarbes and in its	222.9609957724635
environs,” said the cardinal; “to which do you belong?”	258.2742148974094
“I am the son of him who served in the Religious Wars under the great	172.91715802258702
King Henry, the father of his gracious Majesty.”	356.27930863273264
“That is well. It is you who set out seven or eight months ago from	297.4717327670145
your country to seek your fortune in the capital?”	242.60924501497874
“Yes, monseigneur.”	259.8664802067747
“You came through Meung, where something befell you. I don’t very well	237.72647587678182
know what, but still something.”	283.8988131173329
“Monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, “this was what happened to me—”	320.6584361388461
“Never mind, never mind!” resumed the cardinal, with a smile which	339.86975000939947
indicated that he knew the story as well as he who wished to relate it.	213.79867142013484
“You were recommended to Monsieur de Tréville, were you not?”	297.979676422236
“Yes, monseigneur; but in that unfortunate affair at Meung—”	211.90472425295945
“The letter was lost,” replied his Eminence; “yes, I know that. But	231.86094289236235
Monsieur de Tréville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first	344.5137105984642
sight; and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur	193.07169245903128
Dessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter	332.73543718679934
the Musketeers.”	166.40216491695443
“Monseigneur is correctly informed,” said D’Artagnan.	285.68543829938346
“Since that time many things have happened to you. You were walking one	352.4324184061737
day behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had	269.44314643057896
been elsewhere. Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters	235.212607806678
of Forges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours. That is	298.1896022584828
all very simple: you had business in England.”	356.3908767940859
“Monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, quite confused, “I went—”	295.8251930824133
“Hunting at Windsor, or elsewhere—that concerns nobody. I know, because	239.21658838560427
it is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by	213.93470837559272
an august personage, and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the	259.03025673571716
souvenir she gave you.”	232.21372990971844
D’Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen’s diamond, which he wore, and	284.9354250285471
quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late.	350.45907869340397
“The day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,” resumed the	307.5714819645267
cardinal. “He went to desire you to come to the palace. You have not	198.51682799168424
returned that visit, and you were wrong.”	240.9952720408424
“Monseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.”	348.4250029909839
“How could that be, monsieur? Could you incur my displeasure by having	196.54055557091226
followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and	189.06690577330096
courage than another would have done? It is the people who do not obey	347.34577810074893
that I punish, and not those who, like you, obey—but too well. As a	175.4188903498965
proof, remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come	292.61000004422664
to me, and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very	220.53343834454753
night.”	254.33144439289322
That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme. Bonacieux took	261.7310684035987
place. D’Artagnan trembled; and he likewise recollected that during the	174.71370309232182
past half hour the poor woman had passed close to him, without doubt	198.43332605701414
carried away by the same power that had caused her disappearance.	197.41370432305274
“In short,” continued the cardinal, “as I have heard nothing of you for	248.11982724275472
some time past, I wished to know what you were doing. Besides, you owe	259.93685392606443
me some thanks. You must yourself have remarked how much you have been	232.4245866012427
considered in all the circumstances.”	295.99207014670213
D’Artagnan bowed with respect.	166.85154665191848
“That,” continued the cardinal, “arose not only from a feeling of	245.8142531831636
natural equity, but likewise from a plan I have marked out with respect	360.92178667472865
to you.”	315.41493929503247
D’Artagnan became more and more astonished.	349.02504075824777
“I wished to explain this plan to you on the day you received my first	194.57665804410757
invitation; but you did not come. Fortunately, nothing is lost by this	178.20443803942413
delay, and you are now about to hear it. Sit down there, before me,	236.69800954970387
D’Artagnan; you are gentleman enough not to listen standing.” And the	296.7167891341679
cardinal pointed with his finger to a chair for the young man, who was	355.19553520226697
so astonished at what was passing that he awaited a second sign from	172.31300132047053
his interlocutor before he obeyed.	280.46487725718947
“You are brave, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” continued his Eminence; “you are	171.77345637938544
prudent, which is still better. I like men of head and heart. Don’t be	240.07410537201886
afraid,” said he, smiling. “By men of heart I mean men of courage. But	351.05129632498097
young as you are, and scarcely entering into the world, you have	227.1444553844663
powerful enemies; if you do not take great heed, they will destroy	201.4443296292864
you.”	176.91496987753342
“Alas, monseigneur!” replied the young man, “very easily, no doubt, for	298.0334888838354
they are strong and well supported, while I am alone.”	255.1661066160179
“Yes, that’s true; but alone as you are, you have done much already,	232.902673191839
and will do still more, I don’t doubt. Yet you have need, I believe, to	196.47469210245657
be guided in the adventurous career you have undertaken; for, if I	295.0856132373906
mistake not, you came to Paris with the ambitious idea of making your	361.00637107347137
fortune.”	174.95894478687148
“I am at the age of extravagant hopes, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan.	265.3402321512691
“There are no extravagant hopes but for fools, monsieur, and you are a	193.55128336799328
man of understanding. Now, what would you say to an ensign’s commission	277.31137724868745
in my Guards, and a company after the campaign?”	270.3506416212762
“Ah, monseigneur.”	297.1957472941285
“You accept it, do you not?”	269.58098977939835
“Monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, with an embarrassed air.	322.77137207698956
“How? You refuse?” cried the cardinal, with astonishment.	214.0321823911762
“I am in his Majesty’s Guards, monseigneur, and I have no reason to be	224.9414491255086
dissatisfied.”	302.01865550862
“But it appears to me that my Guards—mine—are also his Majesty’s	174.5634521195061
Guards; and whoever serves in a French corps serves the king.”	363.2472898342338
“Monseigneur, your Eminence has ill understood my words.”	238.2410484500855
“You want a pretext, do you not? I comprehend. Well, you have this	208.703395423649
excuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I	225.99181421190104
offer you—so much for the world. As regards yourself, the need of	270.0501418214013
protection; for it is fit you should know, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that I	204.25050255678073
have received heavy and serious complaints against you. You do not	215.36606326077992
consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king’s service.”	245.0348722764563
D’Artagnan colored.	273.05547567236175
“In fact,” said the cardinal, placing his hand upon a bundle of papers,	302.97844253059213
“I have here a whole pile which concerns you. I know you to be a man of	362.76493143589073
resolution; and your services, well directed, instead of leading you to	333.1865791310284
ill, might be very advantageous to you. Come; reflect, and decide.”	170.42247028746283
“Your goodness confounds me, monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and I	197.16673639104735
am conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean	351.14536664103366
as an earthworm; but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely—”	186.09061808129732
D’Artagnan paused.	222.3582318355372
“Yes; speak.”	219.9842124990471
“Then, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king’s	301.40359716752914
Musketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies	230.32914672994403
are in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill	216.87931101583513
received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur	231.84817524941403
offers me.”	201.96590226725232
“Do you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made	255.95066174395814
you an offer equal to your value?” asked the cardinal, with a smile of	259.05173491951814
disdain.	225.7116424121978
“Monseigneur, your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me; and on	258.55095860671486
the contrary, I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness.	240.50774506103292
The siege of La Rochelle is about to be resumed, monseigneur. I shall	229.4246966635372
serve under the eye of your Eminence, and if I have the good fortune to	327.22389081411325
conduct myself at the siege in such a manner as merits your attention,	210.43994106749042
then I shall at least leave behind me some brilliant action to justify	335.3472488103141
the protection with which you honor me. Everything is best in its time,	185.5741411800763
monseigneur. Hereafter, perhaps, I shall have the right of _giving_	255.23126366738614
myself; at present I shall appear to sell myself.”	284.7479818812575
“That is to say, you refuse to serve me, monsieur,” said the cardinal,	322.0336317499067
with a tone of vexation, through which, however, might be seen a sort	277.58411147333925
of esteem; “remain free, then, and guard your hatreds and your	182.10438200297355
sympathies.”	185.05001814773013
“Monseigneur—”	248.62086176519642
“Well, well,” said the cardinal, “I don’t wish you any ill; but you	313.2226272688923
must be aware that it is quite trouble enough to defend and recompense	336.16067259678914
our friends. We owe nothing to our enemies; and let me give you a piece	300.59229832507157
of advice; take care of yourself, Monsieur d’Artagnan, for from the	220.51242841069993
moment I withdraw my hand from behind you, I would not give an _obolus_	171.77178710464494
for your life.”	326.27598688030344
“I will try to do so, monseigneur,” replied the Gascon, with a noble	257.85169934050305
confidence.	223.43487358152058
“Remember at a later period and at a certain moment, if any mischance	308.47976031648517
should happen to you,” said Richelieu, significantly, “that it was I	178.7488751481221
who came to seek you, and that I did all in my power to prevent this	265.5336109715264
misfortune befalling you.”	171.95897561420023
“I shall entertain, whatever may happen,” said D’Artagnan, placing his	225.78709337492555
hand upon his breast and bowing, “an eternal gratitude toward your	330.9324590257347
Eminence for that which you now do for me.”	259.15215068710177
“Well, let it be, then, as you have said, Monsieur d’Artagnan; we shall	194.59928022210113
see each other again after the campaign. I will have my eye upon you,	186.655537983584
for I shall be there,” replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger	239.67466768929944
to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, “and on our return,	350.7890655339965
well—we will settle our account!”	286.5166772549844
“Ah, monseigneur,” cried D’Artagnan, “spare me the weight of your	227.16893515298864
displeasure. Remain neutral monseigneur, if you find that I act as	307.47608532260426
becomes a gallant man.”	254.63875161429766
“Young man,” said Richelieu, “if I shall be able to say to you at	280.84948753644545
another time what I have said to you today, I promise you to do so.”	251.79177656517518
This last expression of Richelieu’s conveyed a terrible doubt; it	194.625204484101
alarmed D’Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a	202.47824488507706
warning. The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some	335.47149836578626
misfortune which threatened him. He opened his mouth to reply, but with	295.82712483492753
a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.	188.01268661370568
D’Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and	230.7753271745557
he felt inclined to return. Then the noble and severe countenance of	292.43155873768256
Athos crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which	331.0431570392757
he required, Athos would no more give him his hand—Athos would renounce	196.1681460677954
him.	330.66598851019194
It was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a	252.85614447897734
truly great character on all that surrounds it.	169.25914789167075
D’Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and	256.0113621112048
found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and	181.3225965323479
beginning to grow uneasy. With a word, D’Artagnan reassured them; and	237.89558966284943
Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep	293.04211452032155
guard longer, as his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal.	203.20973599430445
Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause	250.1238114173566
of the strange interview; but D’Artagnan confined himself to telling	298.77151946454495
them that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter	229.73369560864427
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.	330.2692265975391
“And you were right,” cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice.	340.13695656047247
Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they	279.05909252751155
were alone he said, “You have done that which you ought to have done,	183.09929118584256
D’Artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.”	222.38932919409447
D’Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of	175.8011016726974
his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.	189.2909170920573
The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure.	266.24670959158357
D’Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Tréville. At that time it was	273.82693336280005
believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be	300.957520871405
but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and	276.1673579703318
proposing to set out the day after. M. de Tréville contented himself	175.9435363609174
with asking D’Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but D’Artagnan	197.5282162903108
answered that he was supplied with all he wanted.	247.11905106038594
That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M.	242.85213153709282
Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Tréville who had been	299.5702521128693
accustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when	308.5890733107502
it pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat	178.2213748736208
riotous, as may be imagined. In such cases extreme preoccupation is	251.06797313787098
only to be combated by extreme carelessness.	295.2783638101523
At the first sound of the morning trumpet the friends separated; the	186.91121654649692
Musketeers hastening to the hôtel of M. de Tréville, the Guards to that	175.5872477257794
of M. Dessessart. Each of the captains then led his company to the	223.33494341726242
Louvre, where the king held his review.	196.51462545848176
The king was dull and appeared ill, which detracted a little from his	267.28942025041187
usual lofty bearing. In fact, the evening before, a fever had seized	245.7860025654137
him in the midst of the Parliament, while he was holding his Bed of	309.16480758277726
Justice. He had, not the less, decided upon setting out that same	177.3904648938118
evening; and in spite of the remonstrances that had been offered to	277.8059353228794
him, he persisted in having the review, hoping by setting it at	301.80159638108546
defiance to conquer the disease which began to lay hold upon him.	213.5052721911869
The review over, the Guards set forward alone on their march, the	363.6067339756173
Musketeers waiting for the king, which allowed Porthos time to go and	340.14339704599934
take a turn in his superb equipment in the Rue aux Ours.	195.9088799850749
The procurator’s wife saw him pass in his new uniform and on his fine	320.6413544535942
horse. She loved Porthos too dearly to allow him to part thus; she made	355.5875981455446
him a sign to dismount and come to her. Porthos was magnificent; his	364.3065563101087
spurs jingled, his cuirass glittered, his sword knocked proudly against	349.3005016903667
his ample limbs. This time the clerks evinced no inclination to laugh,	352.5126192061001
such a real ear clipper did Porthos appear.	266.3517245036141
The Musketeer was introduced to M. Coquenard, whose little gray eyes	312.93060253209126
sparkled with anger at seeing his cousin all blazing new. Nevertheless,	285.22524659785415
one thing afforded him inward consolation; it was expected by everybody	275.3766132296979
that the campaign would be a severe one. He whispered a hope to himself	337.6350897810844
that this beloved relative might be killed in the field.	333.3827474456119
Porthos paid his compliments to M. Coquenard and bade him farewell. M.	195.75955336041875
Coquenard wished him all sorts of prosperities. As to Mme. Coquenard,	252.47465692116322
she could not restrain her tears; but no evil impressions were taken	242.19962223398386
from her grief as she was known to be very much attached to her	269.0112849582845
relatives, about whom she was constantly having serious disputes with	365.5603347976113
her husband.	334.39964858654974
But the real adieux were made in Mme. Coquenard’s chamber; they were	316.70189249099565
heartrending.	256.04767551611104
As long as the procurator’s wife could follow him with her eyes, she	186.45607414730426
waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to	332.2237613439533
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. Porthos	303.8174205547716
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such	292.15045650163484
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his	341.72950896684154
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.	178.49021042605244
On his part Aramis wrote a long letter. To whom? Nobody knew. Kitty,	344.53500581332764
who was to set out that evening for Tours, was waiting in the next	211.8425720256858
chamber.	167.42587393270438
Athos sipped the last bottle of his Spanish wine.	254.8620308061271
In the meantime D’Artagnan was defiling with his company. Arriving at	169.22601342163554
the Faubourg St. Antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the	186.90823170459458
Bastille; but as it was the Bastille alone he looked at, he did not	214.12308852919458
observe Milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated	175.00175013739073
him with her finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the	317.2155401084061
ranks to take notice of him. To a look of interrogation which they	326.7471364515909
made, Milady replied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there	199.51947653276
could be no mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her	207.93596085383757
horse and disappeared.	365.67941580462536
The two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St.	214.10619264710215
Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without	185.7937500041418
livery had waiting for them.	182.20837206775576
Chapter XLI.	337.4687049287736
THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE	329.86080493120784
The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the	333.18464007161094
reign of Louis XIII., and one of the great military enterprises of the	307.6101532556184
cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should	336.8346790967716
say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege	225.91100167665752
are connected in too important a manner with the story we have	272.07707738827304
undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence.	245.01478813233172
The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were	187.06491762195654
extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private	252.80111253182832
plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the	334.5503538143028
others.	275.45768799087807
Of the important cities given up by Henry IV. to the Huguenots as places	252.0440818427371
of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary,	339.46976857435357
therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism—a dangerous leaven	190.1086269347182
with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly	210.59774605349625
mingling.	193.54538680093714
Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all	308.75728130659587
nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first	337.22506340103746
summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves	198.1534895904024
like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts	231.85105588251275
of Europe.	325.3241454077823
La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the	191.50417116780818
other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and	332.4717734236508
ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open	347.2495834468808
to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy,	199.6337570002182
the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise.	312.80022234502445
Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic—Protestant	356.86836589264306
by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost;	198.10797147791004
Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart—in	293.5040901541595
short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La	243.2460118601783
Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant	300.27133562613244
nobles like himself, “You will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools	227.02481134331575
enough to take La Rochelle.”	352.30813011842895
And Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of Ré presaged to	256.6081234091588
him the dragonnades of the Cévennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the	188.2490962641318
preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.	309.8536451446082
We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and	207.12400432852542
simplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced	242.8286053795078
to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival.	345.00472292674476
Richelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a	325.2471568908431
simple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound	363.15709462952225
passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her?	302.4817655451127
That we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the	241.44881154265192
anterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage	295.18761738977366
over him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the	217.1489723422369
diamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers	354.01680111008125
and the courage and conduct of D’Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.	200.4902671060628
It was, then, Richelieu’s object, not only to get rid of an enemy of	203.77849047688244
France, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be	178.0371705732756
grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his	168.0654483924331
hand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom.	209.39700046582658
Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that	234.4348379528734
in triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham—in short, that	322.06814565646346
in humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham	233.8000164452788
in the eyes of the queen.	358.51327410375075
On his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England,	335.0093884509018
was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham	186.54092242884147
also was pursuing a private vengeance. Buckingham could not under any	355.5016598230327
pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter	174.58936193065307
it as a conqueror.	350.21933614433857
It resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most	335.5222990320901
powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was	342.2313084134161
simply a kind look from Anne of Austria.	321.90845890344315
The first advantage had been gained by Buckingham. Arriving	278.52579024972545
unexpectedly in sight of the Isle of Ré with ninety vessels and nearly	269.71195025586013
twenty thousand men, he had surprised the Comte de Toiras, who	216.53892552590244
commanded for the king in the Isle, and he had, after a bloody	272.37179330284755
conflict, effected his landing.	301.1893249119475
Allow us to observe in passing that in this fight perished the Baron de	243.73504495737595
Chantal; that the Baron de Chantal left a little orphan girl eighteen	243.7032599578236
months old, and that this little girl was afterward Mme. de Sévigné.	277.5858201486632
The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his	262.60452201906963
garrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of	315.1883788602786
La Prée.	268.58734466596854
This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the	167.99012267213888
king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which	199.80328107715442
was determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations,	298.2246227889535
and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the	318.96043122623365
theater of war. It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our	284.10634295061163
friend D’Artagnan formed a part.	318.81039980618846
The king, as we have said, was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice	205.77167483071776
had been held; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the	267.3324219999975
twenty-eighth of June, he felt himself attacked by fever. He was,	244.33107393171326
notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more	320.11910943020337
serious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy.	273.58969517891387
Now, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted. It followed that	290.1540299422857
D’Artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards, found	167.51649159079923
himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends—Athos,	312.44026554236916
Porthos, and Aramis. This separation, which was no more than an	334.0696305134419
unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious	281.7856988139083
uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was	243.04396184408657
surrounded.	332.9923077167597
He, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before La	229.33079033927726
Rochelle, on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627.	211.5843659143892
Everything was in the same state. The Duke of Buckingham and his	330.9478005508417
English, masters of the Isle of Ré, continued to besiege, but without	288.2113131230244
success, the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée; and	272.0571676530876
hostilities with La Rochelle had commenced, two or three days before,	312.9192120506098
about a fort which the Duc d’Angoulême had caused to be constructed	231.80268177359721
near the city.	342.9943233092723
The Guards, under the command of M. Dessessart, took up their quarters	232.8888582501296
at the Minimes; but, as we know, D’Artagnan, possessed with ambition to	197.0334478434301
enter the Musketeers, had formed but few friendships among his	168.7109436422233
comrades, and he felt himself isolated and given up to his own	316.9427203723026
reflections.	207.9704393912267
His reflections were not very cheerful. From the time of his arrival in	291.5118966912356
Paris, he had been mixed up with public affairs; but his own private	357.56090808562874
affairs had made no great progress, either in love or fortune. As to	217.04695479306082
love, the only woman he could have loved was Mme. Bonacieux; and Mme.	327.42623221876954
Bonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had	231.13708353343935
become of her. As to fortune, he had made—he, humble as he was—an enemy	358.66099977542706
of the cardinal; that is to say, of a man before whom trembled the	295.0538108888705
greatest men of the kingdom, beginning with the king.	229.3687956590494
That man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so. For a	353.0956381609192
mind so perspicuous as that of D’Artagnan, this indulgence was a light	326.0767005337415
by which he caught a glimpse of a better future.	224.63450704923005
Then he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought;	197.44604455653968
but nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised. This enemy	178.46090891975996
was Milady.	278.0132958030556
In exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will	248.56419068617208
of the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an	297.82025342447434
additional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known,	287.27047325155206
protected badly—as witness Chalais and Mme. Bonacieux.	247.9916722488463
What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond, worth five or	297.8581289465201
six thousand livres, which he wore on his finger; and even this	332.7682140623699
diamond—supposing that D’Artagnan, in his projects of ambition, wished	284.7923123836242
to keep it, to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the	207.46881555276775
queen—had not in the meanwhile, since he could not part with it, more	282.8982431568377
value than the gravel he trod under his feet.	365.15013824761706
We say the gravel he trod under his feet, for D’Artagnan made these	312.2557404488319
reflections while walking solitarily along a pretty little road which	196.45836936064143
led from the camp to the village of Angoutin. Now, these reflections	325.78062440092003
had led him further than he intended, and the day was beginning to	174.8651391940863
decline when, by the last ray of the setting sun, he thought he saw the	257.1603337092154
barrel of a musket glitter from behind a hedge.	174.19606179082365
D’Artagnan had a quick eye and a prompt understanding. He comprehended	179.48244557196168
that the musket had not come there of itself, and that he who bore it	199.15668996824974
had not concealed himself behind a hedge with any friendly intentions.	332.2836851113507
He determined, therefore, to direct his course as clear from it as he	221.62585503629668
could when, on the opposite side of the road, from behind a rock, he	174.18491624031168
perceived the extremity of another musket.	281.04587466964347
This was evidently an ambuscade.	230.9803717813988
The young man cast a glance at the first musket and saw, with a certain	280.093297396298
degree of inquietude, that it was leveled in his direction; but as soon	261.6766496424185
as he perceived that the orifice of the barrel was motionless, he threw	191.5999183316563
himself upon the ground. At the same instant the gun was fired, and he	206.83278317085296
heard the whistling of a ball pass over his head.	325.86470907725635
No time was to be lost. D’Artagnan sprang up with a bound, and at the	293.5415267277794
same instant the ball from the other musket tore up the gravel on the	293.3228308701313
very spot on the road where he had thrown himself with his face to the	297.43629471702127
ground.	315.50106220455467
D’Artagnan was not one of those foolhardy men who seek a ridiculous	209.30060580814046
death in order that it may be said of them that they did not retreat a	266.7753713809456
single step. Besides, courage was out of the question here; D’Artagnan	168.06179331555413
had fallen into an ambush.	180.19520218658866
“If there is a third shot,” said he to himself, “I am a lost man.”	353.8407439311958
He immediately, therefore, took to his heels and ran toward the camp,	277.65808162054475
with the swiftness of the young men of his country, so renowned for	216.05941219043308
their agility; but whatever might be his speed, the first who fired,	361.96695032420524
having had time to reload, fired a second shot, and this time so well	310.65385495320936
aimed that it struck his hat, and carried it ten paces from him.	249.68724514774985
As he, however, had no other hat, he picked up this as he ran, and	327.898328343618
arrived at his quarters very pale and quite out of breath. He sat down	293.1781300389499
without saying a word to anybody, and began to reflect.	247.35419810105347
This event might have three causes:	274.53642285746236
The first and the most natural was that it might be an ambuscade of the	240.15194540873264
Rochellais, who might not be sorry to kill one of his Majesty’s Guards,	230.92945595121677
because it would be an enemy the less, and this enemy might have a	226.5066884219832
well-furnished purse in his pocket.	205.53667342312133
D’Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook	290.4216556107175
his head. The ball was not a musket ball—it was an arquebus ball. The	249.2401712582494
accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon	327.68587848664566
had been employed. This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as	261.3219830195601
the ball was not of the regular caliber.	347.552911483157
This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal. It may be	207.1612052522492
observed that at the very moment when, thanks to the ray of the sun, he	191.6338781870017
perceived the gun barrel, he was thinking with astonishment on the	247.66938284587152
forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him.	183.5042958848131
But D’Artagnan again shook his head. For people toward whom he had but	325.48000104352485
to put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means.	175.336728467988
It might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.	308.6693924845087
He tried in vain to remember the faces or dress of the assassins; he	187.70622387322507
had escaped so rapidly that he had not had leisure to notice anything.	189.53963463554763
“Ah, my poor friends!” murmured D’Artagnan; “where are you? And that	242.87805568923875
you should fail me!”	293.3592504213059
D’Artagnan passed a very bad night. Three or four times he started up,	264.4776174940274
imagining that a man was approaching his bed for the purpose of	207.62820544738736
stabbing him. Nevertheless, day dawned without darkness having brought	277.19544613778424
any accident.	341.3104954048722
But D’Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not	354.71237406918
relinquished.	199.9486745687245
D’Artagnan remained all day in his quarters, assigning as a reason to	222.2259474823721
himself that the weather was bad.	333.50376945109974
At nine o’clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms. The Duc	183.743630508611
d’Orléans visited the posts. The guards were under arms, and D’Artagnan	258.82144742215786
took his place in the midst of his comrades.	173.16543849572176
Monsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior	241.03888260275218
officers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart,	302.6422027196859
captain of the Guards, as well as the others.	169.8340383441562
At the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to D’Artagnan that M.	301.10897160869183
Dessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture	217.92703838075664
on the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this	208.4317631532983
gesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive	250.29941134403185
orders.	255.0514571916785
“Monsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous	359.8475961847105
mission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it;	337.01414384338614
and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in	191.34150207264094
readiness.”	237.4104815390305
“Thanks, my captain!” replied D’Artagnan, who wished for nothing better	261.498214646143
than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the	345.0861451111408
lieutenant general.	200.244801960632
In fact the Rochellais had made a _sortie_ during the night, and had	343.88662904708974
retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two	191.7295379836643
days before. The matter was to ascertain, by reconnoitering, how the	337.1345501290739
enemy guarded this bastion.	282.4616754009371
At the end of a few minutes Monsieur raised his voice, and said, “I	254.32206528517838
want for this mission three or four volunteers, led by a man who can be	255.63570750749474
depended upon.”	227.70800799586044
“As to the man to be depended upon, I have him under my hand,	300.1365020146634
monsieur,” said M. Dessessart, pointing to D’Artagnan; “and as to the	294.6412155508342
four or five volunteers, Monsieur has but to make his intentions known,	292.8036784310435
and the men will not be wanting.”	286.0080237768102
“Four men of good will who will risk being killed with me!” said	214.472235739721
D’Artagnan, raising his sword.	194.3529654131962
Two of his comrades of the Guards immediately sprang forward, and two	173.31767023734477
other soldiers having joined them, the number was deemed sufficient.	316.23517095978127
D’Artagnan declined all others, being unwilling to take the first	205.84142548500293
chance from those who had the priority.	267.8668145138992
It was not known whether, after the taking of the bastion, the	311.4968632644752
Rochellais had evacuated it or left a garrison in it; the object then	185.89852669354838
was to examine the place near enough to verify the reports.	305.7506269174834
D’Artagnan set out with his four companions, and followed the trench;	359.37302126854047
the two Guards marched abreast with him, and the two soldiers followed	232.33639870011376
behind.	215.69533100455305
They arrived thus, screened by the lining of the trench, till they came	254.67230926565057
within a hundred paces of the bastion. There, on turning round,	251.98427014143783
D’Artagnan perceived that the two soldiers had disappeared.	359.17445651646347
He thought that, beginning to be afraid, they had stayed behind, and he	336.0535980789049
continued to advance.	206.542761647269
At the turning of the counterscarp they found themselves within about	300.24721154617214
sixty paces of the bastion. They saw no one, and the bastion seemed	275.1943785065298
abandoned.	319.0976852358564
The three composing our forlorn hope were deliberating whether they	168.49847137638602
should proceed any further, when all at once a circle of smoke	197.40919719885343
enveloped the giant of stone, and a dozen balls came whistling around	256.46721754699
D’Artagnan and his companions.	238.293796169566
They knew all they wished to know; the bastion was guarded. A longer	284.36824016173136
stay in this dangerous spot would have been useless imprudence.	261.04602038505595
D’Artagnan and his two companions turned their backs, and commenced a	283.00303393609533
retreat which resembled a flight.	168.47278507068398
On arriving at the angle of the trench which was to serve them as a	290.97312840950747
rampart, one of the Guardsmen fell. A ball had passed through his	215.3186856307586
breast. The other, who was safe and sound, continued his way toward the	224.84188018201976
camp.	311.4112973856572
D’Artagnan was not willing to abandon his companion thus, and stooped	229.50142988085167
to raise him and assist him in regaining the lines; but at this moment	329.25382529707076
two shots were fired. One ball struck the head of the already-wounded	318.20464187511345
guard, and the other flattened itself against a rock, after having	264.51333339995733
passed within two inches of D’Artagnan.	270.55492722476447
The young man turned quickly round, for this attack could not have come	223.1255236970067
from the bastion, which was hidden by the angle of the trench. The idea	238.11027233780388
of the two soldiers who had abandoned him occurred to his mind, and	235.937450439018
with them he remembered the assassins of two evenings before. He	284.0671865662824
resolved this time to know with whom he had to deal, and fell upon the	326.18903996864174
body of his comrade as if he were dead.	325.3213178069868
He quickly saw two heads appear above an abandoned work within thirty	306.0711639839918
paces of him; they were the heads of the two soldiers. D’Artagnan had	198.79945649949013
not been deceived; these two men had only followed for the purpose of	305.30616546432327
assassinating him, hoping that the young man’s death would be placed to	244.61448871243815
the account of the enemy.	209.53790454036692
As he might be only wounded and might denounce their crime, they came	295.0305572124296
up to him with the purpose of making sure. Fortunately, deceived by	194.42333320922538
D’Artagnan’s trick, they neglected to reload their guns.	173.8211272316647
When they were within ten paces of him, D’Artagnan, who in falling had	199.72540183436504
taken care not to let go his sword, sprang up close to them.	174.58823265251627
The assassins comprehended that if they fled toward the camp without	260.40198790867015
having killed their man, they should be accused by him; therefore their	278.8318690665319
first idea was to join the enemy. One of them took his gun by the	237.71757365164518
barrel, and used it as he would a club. He aimed a terrible blow at	252.8440838614025
D’Artagnan, who avoided it by springing to one side; but by this	361.9777676145137
movement he left a passage free to the bandit, who darted off toward	229.50479483354025
the bastion. As the Rochellais who guarded the bastion were ignorant of	233.77928178554117
the intentions of the man they saw coming toward them, they fired upon	209.07705636716398
him, and he fell, struck by a ball which broke his shoulder.	331.3911371191632
Meantime D’Artagnan had thrown himself upon the other soldier,	287.85479484921285
attacking him with his sword. The conflict was not long; the wretch had	264.81262681690583
nothing to defend himself with but his discharged arquebus. The sword	329.3210933717191
of the Guardsman slipped along the barrel of the now-useless weapon,	206.19156660644964
and passed through the thigh of the assassin, who fell.	177.9373083423695
D’Artagnan immediately placed the point of his sword at his throat.	344.7687242067094
“Oh, do not kill me!” cried the bandit. “Pardon, pardon, my officer,	284.44642990534516
and I will tell you all.”	174.52908941573415
“Is your secret of enough importance to me to spare your life for it?”	348.8252847071401
asked the young man, withholding his arm.	294.0047073021286
“Yes; if you think existence worth anything to a man of twenty, as you	230.06621946790452
are, and who may hope for everything, being handsome and brave, as you	321.65147337352124
are.”	282.6439021480252
“Wretch,” cried D’Artagnan, “speak quickly! Who employed you to	259.0421342536804
assassinate me?”	278.12905620851274
“A woman whom I don’t know, but who is called Milady.”	324.1043254929787
“But if you don’t know this woman, how do you know her name?”	241.44300176774067
“My comrade knows her, and called her so. It was with him she agreed,	289.6144241208926
and not with me; he even has in his pocket a letter from that person,	342.468650840313
who attaches great importance to you, as I have heard him say.”	252.7184614906688
“But how did you become concerned in this villainous affair?”	263.34636391136905
“He proposed to me to undertake it with him, and I agreed.”	225.4822510206705
“And how much did she give you for this fine enterprise?”	353.66255702199635
“A hundred louis.”	305.3827555744379
“Well, come!” said the young man, laughing, “she thinks I am worth	307.84981265755107
something. A hundred louis? Well, that was a temptation for two	177.1302590254047
wretches like you. I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my	168.97247841810722
pardon; but upon one condition.”	333.8170805940134
“What is that?” said the soldier, uneasy at perceiving that all was not	294.3618434380396
over.	184.89865635611352
“That you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his	254.0541034689752
pocket.”	294.0357789500332
“But,” cried the bandit, “that is only another way of killing me. How	338.4950138871153
can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?”	304.9865751966979
“You must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear	220.2370646791141
you shall die by my hand.”	211.1845507134823
“Pardon, monsieur; pity! In the name of that young lady you love, and	225.95048291189966
whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!” cried the bandit,	325.35076570126415
throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand—for he began	331.7306772910538
to lose his strength with his blood.	231.50148969682775
“And how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I	354.77773148866265
believed that woman dead?” asked D’Artagnan.	300.3678799972439
“By that letter which my comrade has in his pocket.”	201.4994161630372
“You see, then,” said D’Artagnan, “that I must have that letter. So no	223.3262614618192
more delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance	237.93460143579068
to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you,	324.68597687319385
I swear by my faith as an honest man—” and at these words D’Artagnan	309.2274632688903
made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up.	270.65443264636883
“Stop, stop!” cried he, regaining strength by force of terror. “I will	225.60311387635906
go—I will go!”	245.61271911444499
D’Artagnan took the soldier’s arquebus, made him go on before him, and	216.6847694772009
urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword.	226.758553746154
It was a frightful thing to see this wretch, leaving a long track of	321.18327656512616
blood on the ground he passed over, pale with approaching death, trying	210.96825318376472
to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice,	224.49706930884793
which lay twenty paces from him.	184.18726810694397
Terror was so strongly painted on his face, covered with a cold sweat,	249.0873467888552
that D’Artagnan took pity on him, and casting upon him a look of	274.38023882608024
contempt, “Stop,” said he, “I will show you the difference between a	340.7707996990448
man of courage and such a coward as you. Stay where you are; I will go	346.68749213738005
myself.”	267.03091401584885
And with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements of	237.14626651099377
the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground,	175.47670493706033
D’Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier.	270.7576293076173
There were two means of gaining his object—to search him on the spot,	349.90864063367167
or to carry him away, making a buckler of his body, and search him in	278.4881843438793
the trench.	167.2036118075602
D’Artagnan preferred the second means, and lifted the assassin onto his	283.79556748456116
shoulders at the moment the enemy fired.	176.44970695942766
A slight shock, the dull noise of three balls which penetrated the	211.53129099990403
flesh, a last cry, a convulsion of agony, proved to D’Artagnan that the	224.61680177589966
would-be assassin had saved his life.	235.84805386577142
D’Artagnan regained the trench, and threw the corpse beside the wounded	207.8949540732845
man, who was as pale as death.	168.46054120505957
Then he began to search. A leather pocketbook, a purse, in which was	271.7849104413432
evidently a part of the sum which the bandit had received, with a dice	186.68293089287332
box and dice, completed the possessions of the dead man.	321.50588513564946
He left the box and dice where they fell, threw the purse to the	201.65743777080445
wounded man, and eagerly opened the pocketbook.	226.61865999346227
Among some unimportant papers he found the following letter, that which	245.46533620446587
he had sought at the risk of his life:	238.64436752559496
“Since you have lost sight of that woman and she is now in safety in	200.31693377697758
the convent, which you should never have allowed her to reach, try, at	180.03270579870156
least, not to miss the man. If you do, you know that my hand stretches	354.2131258299332
far, and that you shall pay very dearly for the hundred louis you have	347.3211195196923
from me.”	264.0843912856597
No signature. Nevertheless it was plain the letter came from Milady. He	312.05732458913155
consequently kept it as a piece of evidence, and being in safety behind	269.0508725871547
the angle of the trench, he began to interrogate the wounded man. He	211.5416952456765
confessed that he had undertaken with his comrade—the same who was	266.48374662517006
killed—to carry off a young woman who was to leave Paris by the	187.28064546032857
Barrière de La Villette; but having stopped to drink at a cabaret, they	178.33790123321305
had missed the carriage by ten minutes.	349.9229384199406
“But what were you to do with that woman?” asked D’Artagnan, with	185.71971728025002
anguish.	355.7444482808053
“We were to have conveyed her to a hôtel in the Place Royale,” said the	325.75251301782504
wounded man.	343.98513346252764
“Yes, yes!” murmured D’Artagnan; “that’s the place—Milady’s own	338.2931408157062
residence!”	261.6698001593673
Then the young man tremblingly comprehended what a terrible thirst for	195.68041203937275
vengeance urged this woman on to destroy him, as well as all who loved	210.64473532878284
him, and how well she must be acquainted with the affairs of the court,	326.7913317761522
since she had discovered all. There could be no doubt she owed this	261.0939492453175
information to the cardinal.	344.1786681821187
But amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the	169.57343370937426
queen must have discovered the prison in which poor Mme. Bonacieux was	179.03263502815622
explaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison;	266.52120481151803
and the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage	278.819012739291
along the road of Chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.	314.2698860801538
Then also, as Athos had predicted, it became possible to find Mme.	298.2297751693691
Bonacieux, and a convent was not impregnable.	213.9315902230408
This idea completely restored clemency to his heart. He turned toward	247.9974078562549
the wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various	194.02449946439674
expressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said,	170.6610823940175
“Come, I will not abandon you thus. Lean upon me, and let us return to	354.2631676138378
the camp.”	318.56041768228005
“Yes,” said the man, who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity,	231.86067811947527
“but is it not to have me hanged?”	293.9759332126057
“You have my word,” said he; “for the second time I give you your	260.0802224152151
life.”	280.8799438736858
The wounded man sank upon his knees, to again kiss the feet of his	212.27831308037233
preserver; but D’Artagnan, who had no longer a motive for staying so	279.44991193871465
near the enemy, abridged the testimonials of his gratitude.	289.3755362836129
The Guardsman who had returned at the first discharge announced the	262.6600110587658
death of his four companions. They were therefore much astonished and	297.6935134020996
delighted in the regiment when they saw the young man come back safe	261.62203132543215
and sound.	209.7291581345563
D’Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a _sortie_	178.21707610545437
which he improvised. He described the death of the other soldier, and	209.24577535372913
the perils they had encountered. This recital was for him the occasion	183.45047076995235
of veritable triumph. The whole army talked of this expedition for a	239.70449114394233
day, and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it. Besides this, as	363.17044574723786
every great action bears its recompense with it, the brave exploit of	289.00176639406595
D’Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost.	268.82802784209196
In fact, D’Artagnan believed that he might be tranquil, as one of his	167.47403877610233
two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests.	184.80039258912007
This tranquillity proved one thing—that D’Artagnan did not yet know	254.61794175379117
Milady.	195.97698929524512
Chapter XLII.	182.51956309186454
THE ANJOU WINE	169.11578634634887
After the most disheartening news of the king’s health, a report of his	207.74963334796274
convalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious	243.43037860739315
to be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could	185.79897107946553
mount a horse he would set forward.	365.6692816627545
Meantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might	212.17046656083488
expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d’Angoulême, by	355.09236670693076
Bassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but	228.26054364095475
little, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any	336.8993535257561
great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Ré, where they	330.83606868507127
still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Prée, as on	321.1170622373159
their side the French were besieging La Rochelle.	204.31113932621685
D’Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always	213.6629197150917
happens after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have	189.1464867857987
vanished. He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any	361.7756967232565
tidings from his friends.	253.11371965703452
But one morning at the commencement of the month of November everything	290.86436432982214
was explained to him by this letter, dated from Villeroy:	338.8171435645931
M. D’ARTAGNAN, MM. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, after having had an	327.5251474676792
entertainment at my house and enjoying themselves very much, created	317.7368918517135
such a disturbance that the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has	354.57230044823166
ordered them to be confined for some days; but I accomplish the order	180.94024489353626
they have given me by forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my Anjou	315.12458572940125
wine, with which they are much pleased. They are desirous that you	256.1547433596935
should drink to their health in their favorite wine. I have done this,	196.2498293571274
and am, monsieur, with great respect,	205.15619194246887
Your very humble and obedient servant,	171.4712084921828
GODEAU, _Purveyor of the Musketeers_	268.0886053795689
“That’s all well!” cried D’Artagnan. “They think of me in their	308.3510788394933
pleasures, as I thought of them in my troubles. Well, I will certainly	297.0417460328813
drink to their health with all my heart, but I will not drink alone.”	243.6278565476913
And D’Artagnan went among those Guardsmen with whom he had formed	224.65628980825406
greater intimacy than with the others, to invite them to enjoy with him	362.48938552021787
this present of delicious Anjou wine which had been sent him from	231.85336969671502
Villeroy.	311.07987211534623
One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the	173.75329279182841
next, so the meeting was fixed for the day after that.	344.35339049337256
D’Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the	271.7240675111676
refreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care	319.725717318939
should be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner	363.2269202778764
was fixed for midday D’Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to	354.32484897023875
assist in preparing everything for the entertainment.	172.07997364963623
Planchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord,	251.81545679314587
thought he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this	208.87680441325077
view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master’s	167.40851620953623
guests, named Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill	252.11590248251446
D’Artagnan and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service	323.32193930304487
of D’Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after D’Artagnan had saved his	361.3786186136466
life.	346.55849041320585
The hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their	331.06341377488104
places, and the dishes were arranged on the table. Planchet waited,	256.82916348893036
towel on arm; Fourreau uncorked the bottles; and Brisemont, which was	261.8029159126959
the name of the convalescent, poured the wine, which was a little	320.8740743460324
shaken by its journey, carefully into decanters. Of this wine, the	334.9926096334537
first bottle being a little thick at the bottom, Brisemont poured the	287.17350789745797
lees into a glass, and D’Artagnan desired him to drink it, for the poor	360.0806116476057
devil had not yet recovered his strength.	340.0875470202434
The guests having eaten the soup, were about to lift the first glass of	219.06216754031024
wine to their lips, when all at once the cannon sounded from Fort Louis	344.42968745712653
and Fort Neuf. The Guardsmen, imagining this to be caused by some	260.06354142982775
unexpected attack, either of the besieged or the English, sprang to	291.8589222815511
their swords. D’Artagnan, not less forward than they, did likewise, and	345.0892366771641
all ran out, in order to repair to their posts.	349.9554310464265
But scarcely were they out of the room before they were made aware of	244.69854307187433
the cause of this noise. Cries of “Live the king! Live the cardinal!”	252.1549563978604
resounded on every side, and the drums were beaten in all directions.	318.9530524163059
In short, the king, impatient, as has been said, had come by forced	203.50634936144715
marches, and had that moment arrived with all his household and a	297.26030597079637
reinforcement of ten thousand troops. His Musketeers proceeded and	340.45083811342636
followed him. D’Artagnan, placed in line with his company, saluted with	237.2988600094187
an expressive gesture his three friends, whose eyes soon discovered	269.8120801786031
him, and M. de Tréville, who detected him at once.	284.3787966154722
The ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one	187.02344139449542
another’s arms.	321.25107414739387
“_Pardieu!_” cried D’Artagnan, “you could not have arrived in better	311.20102992173156
time; the dinner cannot have had time to get cold! Can it, gentlemen?”	280.5554692960538
added the young man, turning to the two Guards, whom he introduced to	311.2457851102164
his friends.	332.36300891887885
“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, “it appears we are feasting!”	355.92474514701786
“I hope,” said Aramis, “there are no women at your dinner.”	284.51723892457585
“Is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?” asked Athos.	243.35169477479315
“Well, _pardieu!_ there is yours, my dear friend,” replied D’Artagnan.	198.2072474762156
“Our wine!” said Athos, astonished.	245.39271927140965
“Yes, that you sent me.”	195.72060191450637
“We sent you wine?”	259.2000181758033
“You know very well—the wine from the hills of Anjou.”	178.59646131756983
“Yes, I know what brand you are talking about.”	282.2208863513887
“The wine you prefer.”	279.0887554285379
“Well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content	282.6361830736816
yourselves with that.”	183.06281001285154
“And so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some Anjou	238.12559357140304
wine?” said Porthos.	284.0282753936951
“Not exactly, it is the wine that was sent by your order.”	270.4515155762144
“On our account?” said the three Musketeers.	224.68412246452777
“Did you send this wine, Aramis?” said Athos.	311.46844148273885
“No; and you, Porthos?”	353.44104139231945
“No; and you, Athos?”	272.5567471496072
“No!”	176.2111951994965
“If it was not you, it was your purveyor,” said D’Artagnan.	296.301580383142
“Our purveyor!”	227.3319564585926
“Yes, your purveyor, Godeau—the purveyor of the Musketeers.”	187.22132523555672
“My faith! never mind where it comes from,” said Porthos, “let us taste	299.8459848841911
it, and if it is good, let us drink it.”	360.6543171786486
“No,” said Athos; “don’t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown	318.70208708477696
source.”	214.02483939448925
“You are right, Athos,” said D’Artagnan. “Did none of you charge your	233.36334931339474
purveyor, Godeau, to send me some wine?”	231.33742565223662
“No! And yet you say he has sent you some as from us?”	267.6212137275979
“Here is his letter,” said D’Artagnan, and he presented the note to his	273.79527884899704
comrades.	285.76598954574314
“This is not his writing!” said Athos. “I am acquainted with it; before	191.20651521277247
we left Villeroy I settled the accounts of the regiment.”	298.18757558112
“A false letter altogether,” said Porthos, “we have not been	256.6391267641485
disciplined.”	240.58958258330335
“D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, in a reproachful tone, “how could you	178.32089665568952
believe that we had made a disturbance?”	361.211676651477
D’Artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.	296.2451930013781
“Thou alarmest me!” said Athos, who never used _thee_ and _thou_ but	319.7183568940685
upon very particular occasions, “what has happened?”	330.51884395375373
“Look you, my friends!” cried D’Artagnan, “a horrible suspicion crosses	335.5465679619625
my mind! Can this be another vengeance of that woman?”	210.13574094367868
It was now Athos who turned pale.	282.18321367734427
D’Artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three Musketeers and	265.52177646704575
the two Guards following him.	317.6918614602804
The first object that met the eyes of D’Artagnan on entering the room	318.4513829992078
was Brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible	182.1281750866502
convulsions.	288.4377116490209
Planchet and Fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him	355.7161712073531
succor; but it was plain that all assistance was useless—all the	298.8752347015769
features of the dying man were distorted with agony.	169.52859002093857
“Ah!” cried he, on perceiving D’Artagnan, “ah! this is frightful! You	300.2741676622149
pretend to pardon me, and you poison me!”	202.33132298167084
“I!” cried D’Artagnan. “I, wretch? What do you say?”	324.8814654922514
“I say that it was you who gave me the wine; I say that it was you who	318.00596462268174
desired me to drink it. I say you wished to avenge yourself on me, and	231.00255130922264
I say that it is horrible!”	244.70103904898247
“Do not think so, Brisemont,” said D’Artagnan; “do not think so. I	305.56791601972503
swear to you, I protest—”	253.85834712631382
“Oh, but God is above! God will punish you! My God, grant that he may	175.22344413683703
one day suffer what I suffer!”	271.4103948689016
“Upon the Gospel,” said D’Artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying	259.40886408809035
man, “I swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that I was going to	306.0359963385616
drink of it as you did.”	249.47031788031862
“I do not believe you,” cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible	340.4379825713384
tortures.	365.01253149977686
“Frightful! frightful!” murmured Athos, while Porthos broke the bottles	284.30816948563074
and Aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be	230.19054384687277
sent for.	173.51983042438565
“Oh, my friends,” said D’Artagnan, “you come once more to save my life,	362.6291149176251
not only mine but that of these gentlemen. Gentlemen,” continued he,	209.02715425257534
addressing the Guardsmen, “I request you will be silent with regard to	196.09962698700775
this adventure. Great personages may have had a hand in what you have	219.2936895517431
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us.”	295.27635589336364
“Ah, monsieur!” stammered Planchet, more dead than alive, “ah,	358.5686913966314
monsieur, what an escape I have had!”	318.396943463172
“How, sirrah! you were going to drink my wine?”	232.88794131607904
“To the health of the king, monsieur; I was going to drink a small	251.26420766248032
glass of it if Fourreau had not told me I was called.”	239.81834292321747
“Alas!” said Fourreau, whose teeth chattered with terror, “I wanted to	257.16963723886306
get him out of the way that I might drink myself.”	218.1639459293289
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, addressing the Guardsmen, “you may easily	222.04366838341065
comprehend that such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken	217.46308668824062
place; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, I	201.74657140135398
beg of you.”	245.73464167382338
The two Guardsmen courteously accepted D’Artagnan’s excuses, and	220.57535903238465
perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.	244.9988457846689
When the young Guardsman and the three Musketeers were without	245.2080926462832
witnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly	169.47133784286743
expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.	227.50416555778583
“In the first place,” said Athos, “let us leave this chamber; the dead	325.7286902203563
are not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent	271.883888293645
death.”	216.9760867331055
“Planchet,” said D’Artagnan, “I commit the corpse of this poor devil to	271.3052008835606
your care. Let him be interred in holy ground. He committed a crime, it	221.88592160347855
is true; but he repented of it.”	213.0695443895998
And the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau	279.889582829905
the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont.	219.72355251816438
The host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and	223.42614263103482
some water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain. In a few	312.75168347986835
words, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation.	316.98904202170877
“Well,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “you see, my dear friend, that this	306.179266440086
is war to the death.”	240.93839349128683
Athos shook his head.	199.49890086079375
“Yes, yes,” replied he, “I perceive that plainly; but do you really	284.7361534502074
believe it is she?”	321.11249446418174
“I am sure of it.”	326.94836122872925
“Nevertheless, I confess I still doubt.”	194.78893866972817
“But the _fleur-de-lis_ on her shoulder?”	259.55068636729004
“She is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has	251.55796504384938
been branded in consequence.”	166.8577219905818
“Athos, she is your wife, I tell you,” repeated D’Artagnan; “only	302.8094896394068
reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.”	325.80257133967984
“Yes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so	341.57350240283785
effectually.”	207.089582871011
It was D’Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn.	225.7725711570041
“But in either case, what is to be done?” said the young man.	341.46050108576173
“The fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally	333.4011731388895
over his head,” said Athos. “We must extricate ourselves from this	287.6890827477189
position.”	306.2634997963787
“But how?”	288.3173121185596
“Listen! You must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. Say	264.25956526736144
to her: ‘Peace or war! My word as a gentleman never to say anything of	312.2942383018517
you, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath to	218.06240922189875
remain neutral with respect to me. If not, I will apply to the	332.8194829272602
chancellor, I will apply to the king, I will apply to the hangman, I	320.71478126191005
will move the courts against you, I will denounce you as branded, I	188.80429912346358
will bring you to trial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith	330.9777645654712
of a gentleman, I will kill you at the corner of some wall, as I would	238.9456922037989
a mad dog.’”	245.36434737239475
“I like the means well enough,” said D’Artagnan, “but where and how to	269.3057708974401
meet with her?”	209.4527622522889
“Time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the	287.19454168695586
martingale of man. The more we have ventured the more we gain, when we	362.0538182515231
know how to wait.”	327.76674725940825
“Yes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners.”	257.53984303604307
“Bah!” said Athos. “God has preserved us hitherto, God will preserve us	332.4374256067422
still.”	355.59307815524977
“Yes, we. Besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot	218.13851245751113
to risk our lives; but _she_,” asked he, in an undertone.	278.3241298660872
“What she?” asked Athos.	196.71952733941504
“Constance.”	187.6674870517935
“Madame Bonacieux! Ah, that’s true!” said Athos. “My poor friend, I had	326.0371673653034
forgotten you were in love.”	348.99078695625246
“Well, but,” said Aramis, “have you not learned by the letter you found	362.98731372814893
on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? One may be very	348.4268841037731
comfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is	348.3798266738498
terminated, I promise you on my part—”	250.31111563556954
“Good,” cried Athos, “good! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your	356.3550792547145
views have a religious tendency.”	288.55106502371734
“I am only temporarily a Musketeer,” said Aramis, humbly.	283.50012051390854
“It is some time since we heard from his mistress,” said Athos, in a	317.26606550930336
low voice. “But take no notice; we know all about that.”	186.08719986578063
“Well,” said Porthos, “it appears to me that the means are very	286.80078840563783
simple.”	217.83773961516061
“What?” asked D’Artagnan.	323.0984301192396
“You say she is in a convent?” replied Porthos.	211.60106244338212
“Yes.”	180.39565666371095
“Very well. As soon as the siege is over, we’ll carry her off from that	177.06699398688136
convent.”	174.69995250245182
“But we must first learn what convent she is in.”	244.50696686943294
“That’s true,” said Porthos.	266.7898068013054
“But I think I have it,” said Athos. “Don’t you say, dear D’Artagnan,	342.53981886894485
that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?”	354.12506208161176
“I believe so, at least.”	236.32610459060058
“In that case Porthos will assist us.”	353.2747249932644
“And how so, if you please?”	338.9096153517017
“Why, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. She must have a	285.8779314241276
long arm.”	193.1529630104428
“Hush!” said Porthos, placing a finger on his lips. “I believe her to	328.41210793692153
be a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter.”	325.3791925470183
“Then,” said Aramis, “I take upon myself to obtain intelligence of	298.54125862134686
her.”	255.82212791242637
“You, Aramis?” cried the three friends. “You! And how?”	174.91708884778865
“By the queen’s almoner, to whom I am very intimately allied,” said	362.6761962826964
Aramis, coloring.	338.5868776043826
And on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest	181.88010054160446
repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.	294.76956941618107
D’Artagnan returned to less important affairs, and the three Musketeers	243.45570520163076
repaired to the king’s quarters, where they had to prepare their	256.363437376664
lodging.	235.4996791666954
Chapter XLIII.	200.4279674913062
THE SIGN OF THE RED DOVECOT	274.4163106898506
Meanwhile the king, who, with more reason than the cardinal, showed his	285.863843419103
hatred for Buckingham, although scarcely arrived was in such a haste to	327.522256834038
meet the enemy that he commanded every disposition to be made to drive	246.45907369690622
the English from the Isle of Ré, and afterward to press the siege of La	272.53202838565915
Rochelle; but notwithstanding his earnest wish, he was delayed by the	213.71429950075748
dissensions which broke out between MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg,	309.4470814700217
against the Duc d’Angoulême.	268.03622177652215
MM. Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals of France, and claimed	295.1971365597086
their right of commanding the army under the orders of the king; but	288.6354568558321
the cardinal, who feared that Bassompierre, a Huguenot at heart, might	204.92674110358485
press but feebly the English and Rochellais, his brothers in religion,	268.9091706525784
supported the Duc d’Angoulême, whom the king, at his instigation, had	346.9780552908237
named lieutenant general. The result was that to prevent MM.	237.15715481874247
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting the army, a separate command	304.0142376727265
had to be given to each. Bassompierre took up his quarters on the north	182.7506630590231
of the city, between Leu and Dompierre; the Duc d’Angoulême on the	271.96929059889146
east, from Dompierre to Perigny; and M. de Schomberg on the south, from	189.27931559572608
Perigny to Angoutin.	181.1174461591312
The quarters of Monsieur were at Dompierre; the quarters of the king	210.99090519666584
were sometimes at Estrée, sometimes at Jarrie; the cardinal’s quarters	240.00269042867643
were upon the downs, at the bridge of La Pierre, in a simple house	294.7307683801346
without any entrenchment. So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre; the	240.76504015428932
king, the Duc d’Angoulême; and the cardinal, M. de Schomberg.	270.3148382988701
As soon as this organization was established, they set about driving	337.6320482364143
the English from the Isle.	339.5655606155875
The juncture was favorable. The English, who require, above everything,	319.7567331340743
good living in order to be good soldiers, only eating salt meat and bad	281.1105389283576
biscuit, had many invalids in their camp. Still further, the sea, very	226.54331281795558
rough at this period of the year all along the sea coast, destroyed	332.5142689406185
every day some little vessel; and the shore, from the point of	284.3186746352793
l’Aiguillon to the trenches, was at every tide literally covered with	223.58302858828415
the wrecks of pinnacles, _roberges_, and feluccas. The result was that	291.28981397566986
even if the king’s troops remained quietly in their camp, it was	182.06679679920722
evident that some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the	310.25898700268255
Isle from obstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege.	202.25045015837344
But as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in	180.41440330594727
the enemy’s camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be	291.6038162471871
best to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a	286.2828587762807
decisive action.	232.3013350010774
As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the	194.38462738669898
contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected	199.15782019713026
with the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying	300.09510516880596
in two words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment	180.7797875279397
of the king and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed	304.13154066143125
foot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of	227.71031630642915
the Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of	178.61983529060805
battle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three	328.3033082627136
lieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen	235.74532239334877
of rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to	327.0754108222693
Paris by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the	309.50723626661227
arches of Notre Dame.	249.34401309124218
Te Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France.	315.7087019408867
The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at	359.27244592742386
least at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English.	317.563323400999
But it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy	210.42116050324057
of the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was	174.95177328096543
obtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and	207.94643587020573
Lorraine. This league was directed against France.	212.38038540638775
Still further, in Buckingham’s lodging, which he had been forced to	345.7540896890275
abandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which	254.906268183358
confirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his	223.475527841791
memoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the	261.17578167505474
queen.	352.02545753453353
It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is	317.4687079198294
not a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the	341.6875458024421
vast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in	228.84503659441424
listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of	217.35937406477834
Europe.	328.7054741010112
The cardinal was acquainted with the activity, and more particularly	230.26923671423825
the hatred, of Buckingham. If the league which threatened France	239.91187948775
triumphed, all his influence would be lost. Spanish policy and Austrian	315.9039316807046
policy would have their representatives in the cabinet of the Louvre,	365.12855927252974
where they had as yet but partisans; and he, Richelieu—the French	171.17415008884828
minister, the national minister—would be ruined. The king, even while	180.94391909606608
obeying him like a child, hated him as a child hates his master, and	334.1804305711745
would abandon him to the personal vengeance of Monsieur and the queen.	335.71122213905295
He would then be lost, and France, perhaps, with him. All this must be	227.90063810199212
prepared against.	260.11077914032927
Courtiers, becoming every instant more numerous, succeeded one another,	253.3665840070579
day and night, in the little house of the bridge of La Pierre, in which	303.315590753449
the cardinal had established his residence.	262.3572467767896
There were monks who wore the frock with such an ill grace that it was	279.7801108230587
easy to perceive they belonged to the church militant; women a little	209.5375676297689
inconvenienced by their costume as pages and whose large trousers could	314.02475596642824
not entirely conceal their rounded forms; and peasants with blackened	347.2548185803969
hands but with fine limbs, savoring of the man of quality a league off.	326.77491412395364
There were also less agreeable visits—for two or three times reports	269.63199206673266
were spread that the cardinal had nearly been assassinated.	302.6919102062768
It is true that the enemies of the cardinal said that it was he himself	349.0543745500835
who set these bungling assassins to work, in order to have, if wanted,	328.1121547460317
the right of using reprisals; but we must not believe everything	171.283085611408
ministers say, nor everything their enemies say.	355.08627856800535
These attempts did not prevent the cardinal, to whom his most	334.9504736525972
inveterate detractors have never denied personal bravery, from making	230.62267218405793
nocturnal excursions, sometimes to communicate to the Duc d’Angoulême	179.67760624103508
important orders, sometimes to confer with the king, and sometimes to	290.9639126209209
have an interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.	259.09409519250516
On their part the Musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,	325.8857510818607
were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. This was the	348.99462008913736
more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of	299.8014462044385
M. de Tréville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent	190.1758201853885
after the closing of the camp.	242.33252314394497
Now, one evening when D’Artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able	198.44067553705057
to accompany them, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, mounted on their battle	271.85929112663115
steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their	186.76438401681096
pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the Red	186.25999218651674
Dovecot, which Athos had discovered two days before upon the route to	305.47575202672914
Jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their	182.31249874673787
guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a	361.6981558658401
quarter of a league from the village of Boisnau, they fancied they	195.98202561442943
heard the sound of horses approaching them. They immediately all three	279.66035145651887
halted, closed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road. In an	342.14855783852136
instant, and as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a	327.7975414336448
turning of the road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in	167.5823305996151
their turn, appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their	238.0504740278526
route or go back. The hesitation created some suspicion in the three	173.9023399422387
friends, and Athos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried	309.7949309327465
in a firm voice, “Who goes there?”	351.5866604729622
“Who goes there, yourselves?” replied one of the horsemen.	315.19743895244414
“That is not an answer,” replied Athos. “Who goes there? Answer, or we	215.81062001879508
charge.”	184.72053989496567
“Beware of what you are about, gentlemen!” said a clear voice which	188.71159579983237
seemed accustomed to command.	240.03035740904713
“It is some superior officer making his night rounds,” said Athos.	242.8948522359663
“What do you wish, gentlemen?”	328.5818638109258
“Who are you?” said the same voice, in the same commanding tone.	311.2277633085831
“Answer in your turn, or you may repent of your disobedience.”	166.41130393986225
“King’s Musketeers,” said Athos, more and more convinced that he who	180.01365778118188
interrogated them had the right to do so.	341.93104743431104
“What company?”	201.08708363955145
“Company of Tréville.”	313.4040646807172
“Advance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour.”	181.54147784364622
The three companions advanced rather humbly—for all were now convinced	221.21263733392533
that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves—leaving	298.99451301654756
Athos the post of speaker.	293.83127177199975
One of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front	357.67373783748
of his companion. Athos made a sign to Porthos and Aramis also to	231.4247050850975
remain in the rear, and advanced alone.	351.86375123481565
“Your pardon, my officer,” said Athos; “but we were ignorant with whom	275.8414875755908
we had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard.”	363.299480659338
“Your name?” said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his	174.01052952433622
cloak.	242.16418043352337
“But yourself, monsieur,” said Athos, who began to be annoyed by this	173.20603211842678
inquisition, “give me, I beg you, the proof that you have the right to	308.386499642545
question me.”	364.6410680792217
“Your name?” repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak	236.46637431030848
fall, and leaving his face uncovered.	331.44679187018517
“Monsieur the Cardinal!” cried the stupefied Musketeer.	339.19867093525176
“Your name?” cried his Eminence, for the third time.	327.9924374363368
“Athos,” said the Musketeer.	231.00328532564237
The cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near. “These three	241.33160018913694
Musketeers shall follow us,” said he, in an undertone. “I am not	284.53326326773066
willing it should be known I have left the camp; and if they follow us	278.0486509934204
we shall be certain they will tell nobody.”	225.9430211839838
“We are gentlemen, monseigneur,” said Athos; “require our parole, and	258.40076638046264
give yourself no uneasiness. Thank God, we can keep a secret.”	359.007523765933
The cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.	218.95880816538602
“You have a quick ear, Monsieur Athos,” said the cardinal; “but now	243.85677776595645
listen to this. It is not from mistrust that I request you to follow	345.41009253261956
me, but for my security. Your companions are no doubt Messieurs Porthos	304.82060982725716
and Aramis.”	306.6406954452931
“Yes, your Eminence,” said Athos, while the two Musketeers who had	196.0576858431367
remained behind advanced hat in hand.	353.2360132777555
“I know you, gentlemen,” said the cardinal, “I know you. I know you are	247.71811604744062
not quite my friends, and I am sorry you are not so; but I know you are	330.2210010772453
brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.	354.3520972310522
Monsieur Athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your	196.01031508736503
two friends, and then I shall have an escort to excite envy in his	192.0050666847346
Majesty, if we should meet him.”	181.49101511684864
The three Musketeers bowed to the necks of their horses.	262.32815803549835
“Well, upon my honor,” said Athos, “your Eminence is right in taking us	212.16430816772183
with you; we have seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we	290.8066944195965
have even had a quarrel at the Red Dovecot with four of those faces.”	174.24066903304194
“A quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?” said the cardinal; “you know I	273.09454311945194
don’t like quarrelers.”	249.27111432589726
“And that is the reason why I have the honor to inform your Eminence of	309.0197076883992
what has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false	280.4547346660794
account believe us to be in fault.”	236.04793397952744
“What have been the results of your quarrel?” said the cardinal,	209.6293277409917
knitting his brow.	337.438253268601
“My friend, Aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,	263.70856988407945
but not enough to prevent him, as your Eminence may see, from mounting	316.6487496954115
to the assault tomorrow, if your Eminence orders an escalade.”	277.898850472307
“But you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you	184.24003147796475
thus,” said the cardinal. “Come, be frank, gentlemen, you have settled	167.71838322535018
accounts with somebody! Confess; you know I have the right of giving	314.84666925661804
absolution.”	223.29428515959165
“I, monseigneur?” said Athos. “I did not even draw my sword, but I took	360.524873568555
him who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window. It	166.86726778479306
appears that in falling,” continued Athos, with some hesitation, “he	316.59308060739534
broke his thigh.”	277.4867419621015
“Ah, ah!” said the cardinal; “and you, Monsieur Porthos?”	181.84798449475804
“I, monseigneur, knowing that dueling is prohibited—I seized a bench,	353.30171710501327
and gave one of those brigands such a blow that I believe his shoulder	293.08141879675776
is broken.”	238.0422311081096
“Very well,” said the cardinal; “and you, Monsieur Aramis?”	166.39555509838573
“Monseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of	250.2529409957645
which Monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, I	286.4375759728835
endeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a	201.5893362950425
wound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. Then I admit my	364.0308631996052
patience failed me; I drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to	325.5249685245554
the charge, I fancied I felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let	201.5190072835628
it pass through his body. I only know for a certainty that he fell; and	291.8775816565468
it seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions.”	245.2187719454093
“The devil, gentlemen!” said the cardinal, “three men placed _hors de	186.27817962370588
combat_ in a cabaret squabble! You don’t do your work by halves. And	271.32758846016475
pray what was this quarrel about?”	322.4334491419406
“These fellows were drunk,” said Athos, “and knowing there was a lady	239.18142283375448
who had arrived at the cabaret this evening, they wanted to force her	357.1604477196879
door.”	252.37511507784038
“Force her door!” said the cardinal, “and for what purpose?”	340.86315819235733
“To do her violence, without doubt,” said Athos. “I have had the honor	310.07821658530895
of informing your Eminence that these men were drunk.”	310.6175566047924
“And was this lady young and handsome?” asked the cardinal, with a	280.68297274813835
certain degree of anxiety.	336.31766662807144
“We did not see her, monseigneur,” said Athos.	199.404949986156
“You did not see her? Ah, very well,” replied the cardinal, quickly.	300.8536969046063
“You did well to defend the honor of a woman; and as I am going to the	170.20023586541797
Red Dovecot myself, I shall know if you have told me the truth.”	171.51586351261722
“Monseigneur,” said Athos, haughtily, “we are gentlemen, and to save	343.92730437183536
our heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood.”	181.74869703383055
“Therefore I do not doubt what you say, Monsieur Athos, I do not doubt	180.04742092575324
it for a single instant; but,” added he, “to change the conversation,	338.1230278638516
was this lady alone?”	173.36159393945334
“The lady had a cavalier shut up with her,” said Athos, “but as	255.88176285190153
notwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to	192.24944397624108
be presumed that he is a coward.”	175.61036267220805
“‘Judge not rashly’, says the Gospel,” replied the cardinal.	310.4924670000772
Athos bowed.	260.67804151947155
“And now, gentlemen, that’s well,” continued the cardinal. “I know what	296.6503432243028
I wish to know; follow me.”	340.81764667025857
The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped	321.4513918658772
his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight	356.87420740152436
to ten paces in advance of his four companions.	362.01908174824615
They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew	254.3514529139747
what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent	188.50371850574328
intruders out of the way.	200.9846588821675
Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the	313.58724016222163
three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window	327.2363239142808
shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner.	244.04333357726523
A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some	319.4045777325402
rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and	215.4139870218032
set off in the direction of Surgères, which was likewise the way to	176.58868819757433
Paris.	355.9956482993068
“Advance, gentlemen,” said the cardinal.	250.64876862366705
“You have told me the truth, my gentlemen,” said he, addressing the	208.73725744562256
Musketeers, “and it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening	284.9464150123537
be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.”	290.7054028722363
The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal	334.1830483623527
threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers	220.21541909200496
fastened the horses to the shutters.	272.11450786100215
The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer	307.67957080366136
coming to visit a lady.	209.78072373831498
“Have you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can	171.1100523878125
wait near a good fire?” said the cardinal.	215.58368701806714
The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had	330.2341426560317
just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney.	233.3511233856261
“I have this,” said he.	280.0530382770887
“That will do,” replied the cardinal. “Enter, gentlemen, and be kind	357.6980248364406
enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.”	169.58294071429154
And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the	186.53702266736332
cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase	298.03976289764654
like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.	300.532365583752
Chapter XLIV.	342.1480371482099
THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES	295.39256210934406
It was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their	202.7491412873916
chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just	226.87699515769285
rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special	361.564387934871
protection.	187.48001033324724
Now, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers	289.41826710243186
put to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw	276.8009510214739
any light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice.	298.3701872048419
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.	204.98480574707656
Athos walked about in a contemplative mood.	259.8185143312025
While thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe	247.97061256502568
of the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the	304.0995812830687
chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur	309.425559150887
of words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it,	311.1475749677777
and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an	261.88512013964305
interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining	314.7902697263754
himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.	340.97929201234905
“Listen, Milady,” said the cardinal, “the affair is important. Sit	357.16811928131415
down, and let us talk it over.”	312.7377933934369
“Milady!” murmured Athos.	309.8779312204425
“I listen to your Eminence with greatest attention,” replied a female	332.7465350805307
voice which made the Musketeer start.	187.500657741049
“A small vessel with an English crew, whose captain is on my side,	197.04514971667297
awaits you at the mouth of Charente, at Fort La Pointe*. He will set	166.0244877992381
sail tomorrow morning.”	248.01271154164627
* Fort La Pointe, or Fort Vasou, was not built until 1672, nearly 50	274.3734534536844
years later.	283.81877489405997
“I must go thither tonight?”	218.99175228744394
“Instantly! That is to say, when you have received my instructions. Two	272.0527777460323
men, whom you will find at the door on going out, will serve you as	345.68668361434936
escort. You will allow me to leave first; then, after half an hour, you	284.4372267032136
can go away in your turn.”	207.82273686334247
“Yes, monseigneur. Now let us return to the mission with which you wish	203.53371151681574
to charge me; and as I desire to continue to merit the confidence of	196.37071612756077
your Eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise,	293.4245544287489
that I may not commit an error.”	220.14250524871358
There was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors.	204.5168111318848
It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in	257.6686681799188
which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her	178.63601429560853
intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say,	204.81905877883804
and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.	282.05100855569515
Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to	277.52438747269065
fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with	274.9465928655717
him.	282.75943432782844
The two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of	330.3226422423595
themselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads	202.93009195005078
together and their ears on the alert.	284.50689450696643
“You will go to London,” continued the cardinal. “Arrived in London,	247.56377612271808
you will seek Buckingham.”	320.85909954342185
“I must beg your Eminence to observe,” said Milady, “that since the	206.44548194403342
affair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me,	319.6630624704503
his Grace distrusts me.”	221.13107836677767
“Well, this time,” said the cardinal, “it is not necessary to steal his	313.73786115192314
confidence, but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a	364.51900994493707
negotiator.”	326.18679793124164
“Frankly and loyally,” repeated Milady, with an unspeakable expression	232.56354816185933
of duplicity.	186.00209849214568
“Yes, frankly and loyally,” replied the cardinal, in the same tone.	309.62986619774273
“All this negotiation must be carried on openly.”	208.72947982533512
“I will follow your Eminence’s instructions to the letter. I only wait	262.96149432510504
till you give them.”	247.42073307566358
“You will go to Buckingham in my behalf, and you will tell him I am	207.69359958807462
acquainted with all the preparations he has made; but that they give me	358.7717318276059
no uneasiness, since at the first step he takes I will ruin the queen.”	176.64337981095306
“Will he believe that your Eminence is in a position to accomplish the	362.91967921613457
threat thus made?”	188.47864369191325
“Yes; for I have the proofs.”	292.7912285704543
“I must be able to present these proofs for his appreciation.”	183.47376135344115
“Without doubt. And you will tell him I will publish the report of	285.7140426202208
Bois-Robert and the Marquis de Beautru, upon the interview which the	306.0934881704924
duke had at the residence of Madame the Constable with the queen on the	262.5159539263227
evening Madame the Constable gave a masquerade. You will tell him, in	180.39560355761006
order that he may not doubt, that he came there in the costume of the	175.12653786353323
Great Mogul, which the Chevalier de Guise was to have worn, and that he	217.07421296098673
purchased this exchange for the sum of three thousand pistoles.”	255.41849909201565
“Well, monseigneur?”	169.08114819796185
“All the details of his coming into and going out of the palace—on the	187.19414004509855
night when he introduced himself in the character of an Italian fortune	365.8619002573922
teller—you will tell him, that he may not doubt the correctness of my	350.00448762512275
information; that he had under his cloak a large white robe dotted with	311.5260320718506
black tears, death’s heads, and crossbones—for in case of a surprise,	201.37162226129607
he was to pass for the phantom of the White Lady who, as all the world	242.44043039882342
knows, appears at the Louvre every time any great event is impending.”	352.99296955461756
“Is that all, monseigneur?”	313.6514523164391
“Tell him also that I am acquainted with all the details of the	299.7024255003215
adventure at Amiens; that I will have a little romance made of it,	344.10797716378994
wittily turned, with a plan of the garden and portraits of the	311.4419844102418
principal actors in that nocturnal romance.”	319.804919303024
“I will tell him that.”	253.94493174889703
“Tell him further that I hold Montague in my power; that Montague is in	232.88913811412695
the Bastille; that no letters were found upon him, it is true, but that	251.81082532134116
torture may make him tell much of what he knows, and even what he does	278.6865768149471
not know.”	194.29074855306732
“Exactly.”	218.29814505218923
“Then add that his Grace has, in the precipitation with which he quit	236.71726508252766
the Isle of Ré, forgotten and left behind him in his lodging a certain	173.1447001206858
letter from Madame de Chevreuse which singularly compromises the queen,	328.48069987349345
inasmuch as it proves not only that her Majesty can love the enemies of	250.1990685955355
the king but that she can conspire with the enemies of France. You	347.16792391514207
recollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?”	348.47593585850353
“Your Eminence will judge: the ball of Madame the Constable; the night	282.2693839688267
at the Louvre; the evening at Amiens; the arrest of Montague; the	343.10239283190515
letter of Madame de Chevreuse.”	330.1000330775414
“That’s it,” said the cardinal, “that’s it. You have an excellent	315.68397349272425
memory, Milady.”	361.35426986828577
“But,” resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering	318.6785024315262
compliment, “if, in spite of all these reasons, the duke does not give	356.3415878520127
way and continues to menace France?”	275.6690454161566
“The duke is in love to madness, or rather to folly,” replied	209.4199760754854
Richelieu, with great bitterness. “Like the ancient paladins, he has	268.23945112980743
only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love. If he	202.79336490005403
becomes certain that this war will cost the honor, and perhaps the	310.85578781130414
liberty, of the lady of his thoughts, as he says, I will answer for it	195.39717040810896
he will look twice.”	252.71816291309528
“And yet,” said Milady, with a persistence that proved she wished to	332.7572856410845
see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be	213.65885567773745
charged, “if he persists?”	213.94377836258525
“If he persists?” said the cardinal. “That is not probable.”	204.45502135377717
“It is possible,” said Milady.	336.66972537425386
“If he persists—” His Eminence made a pause, and resumed: “If he	217.26669777624096
persists—well, then I shall hope for one of those events which change	256.781172666527
the destinies of states.”	240.34766968494876
“If your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in	230.7619382632799
history,” said Milady, “perhaps I should partake of your confidence as	209.93834203959125
to the future.”	226.6751570384251
“Well, here, for example,” said Richelieu: “when, in 1610, for a cause	202.7048137737603
similar to that which moves the duke, King Henry IV., of glorious	287.8113338198976
memory, was about, at the same time, to invade Flanders and Italy, in	170.23544917314317
order to attack Austria on both sides. Well, did there not happen an	351.7579589309889
event which saved Austria? Why should not the king of France have the	207.27345551480434
same chance as the emperor?”	308.88499780274867
“Your Eminence means, I presume, the knife stab in the Rue de la	335.5046297762749
Feronnerie?”	265.4285121031968
“Precisely,” said the cardinal.	196.52513377391733
“Does not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon	289.8587200976188
Ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating	245.16378648840146
him?”	295.9732289031287
“There will be, in all times and in all countries, particularly if	364.0695768155616
religious divisions exist in those countries, fanatics who ask nothing	271.43113733028383
better than to become martyrs. Ay, and observe—it just occurs to me	321.3637296499111
that the Puritans are furious against Buckingham, and their preachers	177.61541315210417
designate him as the Antichrist.”	180.6991327093999
“Well?” said Milady.	233.1418817802354
“Well,” continued the cardinal, in an indifferent tone, “the only thing	181.26851053835313
to be sought for at this moment is some woman, handsome, young, and	239.8129128626341
clever, who has cause of quarrel with the duke. The duke has had many	253.12532739517684
affairs of gallantry; and if he has fostered his amours by promises of	217.41848426667275
eternal constancy, he must likewise have sown the seeds of hatred by	358.9995532370217
his eternal infidelities.”	238.14889965774006
“No doubt,” said Milady, coolly, “such a woman may be found.”	249.09399967842091
“Well, such a woman, who would place the knife of Jacques Clément or of	216.8136228663773
Ravaillac in the hands of a fanatic, would save France.”	166.16465475130838
“Yes; but she would then be the accomplice of an assassination.”	232.1994544379055
“Were the accomplices of Ravaillac or of Jacques Clément ever known?”	318.00116327450525
“No; for perhaps they were too high-placed for anyone to dare look for	244.54093214759683
them where they were. The Palace of Justice would not be burned down	228.34311244854268
for everybody, monseigneur.”	321.63570305174545
“You think, then, that the fire at the Palace of Justice was not caused	253.66410250790722
by chance?” asked Richelieu, in the tone with which he would have put a	212.03494682809205
question of no importance.	185.53401025108315
“I, monseigneur?” replied Milady. “I think nothing; I quote a fact,	300.24949039720946
that is all. Only I say that if I were named Madame de Montpensier, or	170.31590016679263
the Queen Marie de Médicis, I should use less precautions than I take,	179.38127748004848
being simply called Milady Clarik.”	280.7376213619411
“That is just,” said Richelieu. “What do you require, then?”	228.8512877585277
“I require an order which would ratify beforehand all that I should	274.03389700759794
think proper to do for the greatest good of France.”	327.0993506605479
“But in the first place, this woman I have described must be found who	333.00039529485525
is desirous of avenging herself upon the duke.”	292.5288853177709
“She is found,” said Milady.	175.3400456553856
“Then the miserable fanatic must be found who will serve as an	284.60534650969817
instrument of God’s justice.”	203.69083674138267
“He will be found.”	306.0214656843872
“Well,” said the cardinal, “then it will be time to claim the order	328.330578373314
which you just now required.”	215.26478213892528
“Your Eminence is right,” replied Milady; “and I have been wrong in	341.5377244353999
seeing in the mission with which you honor me anything but that which	264.71294866513335
it really is—that is, to announce to his Grace, on the part of your	167.21976473491833
Eminence, that you are acquainted with the different disguises by means	225.14318025052032
of which he succeeded in approaching the queen during the fête given by	180.83743038159145
Madame the Constable; that you have proofs of the interview granted at	276.76051203048837
the Louvre by the queen to a certain Italian astrologer who was no	292.1379513481615
other than the Duke of Buckingham; that you have ordered a little	309.2251731178731
romance of a satirical nature to be written upon the adventures of	350.1717118149629
Amiens, with a plan of the gardens in which those adventures took	310.5429586503251
place, and portraits of the actors who figured in them; that Montague	266.92191426170234
is in the Bastille, and that the torture may make him say things he	263.0082276885265
remembers, and even things he has forgotten; that you possess a certain	224.44947520655552
letter from Madame de Chevreuse, found in his Grace’s lodging, which	345.2896820109695
singularly compromises not only her who wrote it, but her in whose name	362.21611681941954
it was written. Then, if he persists, notwithstanding all this—as that	235.10334725469028
is, as I have said, the limit of my mission—I shall have nothing to do	231.00716041071925
but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France. That is	359.489529740065
it, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?”	360.75181119347036
“That is it,” replied the cardinal, dryly.	364.0676191834415
“And now,” said Milady, without appearing to remark the change of the	358.1018256955739
duke’s tone toward her—“now that I have received the instructions of	302.93547509464474
your Eminence as concerns your enemies, Monseigneur will permit me to	305.70338155806576
say a few words to him of mine?”	226.0363092208984
“Have you enemies, then?” asked Richelieu.	328.39773761748836
“Yes, monseigneur, enemies against whom you owe me all your support,	216.84768695235468
for I made them by serving your Eminence.”	226.04551678591673
“Who are they?” replied the duke.	184.08563879241706
“In the first place, there is a little _intrigante_ named Bonacieux.”	228.55737190864426
“She is in the prison of Nantes.”	261.48712749166043
“That is to say, she was there,” replied Milady; “but the queen has	267.1278895307876
obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed	245.97139091536548
to a convent.”	312.5840210060093
“To a convent?” said the duke.	213.9245699924685
“Yes, to a convent.”	182.54903633067968
“And to which?”	198.02794499106423
“I don’t know; the secret has been well kept.”	258.3273023749508
“But _I_ will know!”	174.42352212208738
“And your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?”	297.05889076009277
“I can see nothing inconvenient in that,” said the cardinal.	351.1815702353215
“Well, now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this	250.22442191313974
little Madame Bonacieux.”	297.07868484141
“Who is that?”	364.85985276357746
“Her lover.”	291.5769985642137
“What is his name?”	194.34042367905232
“Oh, your Eminence knows him well,” cried Milady, carried away by her	207.59625035287416
anger. “He is the evil genius of both of us. It is he who in an	214.44430176709315
encounter with your Eminence’s Guards decided the victory in favor of	169.59320759091622
the king’s Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to De	242.94586866613116
Wardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs	244.85424700996379
to fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux	332.5821613552245
carried off, has sworn my death.”	243.1334123028291
“Ah, ah!” said the cardinal, “I know of whom you speak.”	329.49315916754597
“I mean that miserable D’Artagnan.”	351.43814289480673
“He is a bold fellow,” said the cardinal.	280.31065358204575
“And it is exactly because he is a bold fellow that he is the more to	295.72359306409453
be feared.”	207.4294734992988
“I must have,” said the duke, “a proof of his connection with	279.83600372794217
Buckingham.”	213.8831389694317
“A proof?” cried Milady; “I will have ten.”	315.30584056417655
“Well, then, it becomes the simplest thing in the world; get me that	174.66032861559364
proof, and I will send him to the Bastille.”	245.61384907725375
“So far good, monseigneur; but afterwards?”	203.15967135717327
“When once in the Bastille, there is no afterward!” said the cardinal,	179.6510360666495
in a low voice. “Ah, _pardieu!_” continued he, “if it were as easy for	275.85501256303075
me to get rid of my enemy as it is easy to get rid of yours, and if it	189.38155427324105
were against such people you require impunity—”	219.2171204901482
“Monseigneur,” replied Milady, “a fair exchange. Life for life, man for	192.699008808713
man; give me one, I will give you the other.”	263.93066408920635
“I don’t know what you mean, nor do I even desire to know what you	281.5964496090699
mean,” replied the cardinal; “but I wish to please you, and see nothing	262.1330799667719
out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so	337.1837028792542
infamous a creature—the more so as you tell me this D’Artagnan is a	230.92822940972522
libertine, a duelist, and a traitor.”	252.37324822213213
“An infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!”	239.0433648992494
“Give me paper, a quill, and some ink, then,” said the cardinal.	351.09252358310715
“Here they are, monseigneur.”	281.47554230496854
There was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was	317.7745508962229
employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or	288.10774982497156
else in writing it. Athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation,	218.02522314312353
took his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of	198.80321540530983
the room.	172.54530294286113
“Well,” said Porthos, “what do you want, and why do you not let us	332.00588340863806
listen to the end of the conversation?”	305.39549145802647
“Hush!” said Athos, speaking in a low voice. “We have heard all it was	281.89257152792334
necessary we should hear; besides, I don’t prevent you from listening,	356.86103852348015
but I must be gone.”	252.95929800936236
“You must be gone!” said Porthos; “and if the cardinal asks for you,	261.51304544631694
what answer can we make?”	337.196377044418
“You will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him	296.0317693824793
that I am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host	281.04081256443476
have given me reason to think the road is not safe. I will say two	277.6643580315467
words about it to the cardinal’s esquire likewise. The rest concerns	271.9870973123142
myself; don’t be uneasy about that.”	259.32071167705806
“Be prudent, Athos,” said Aramis.	196.98189758071584
“Be easy on that head,” replied Athos; “you know I am cool enough.”	203.6616920478994
Porthos and Aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.	320.79380314583375
As to Athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was	215.2373477707905
tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in	204.75651571939724
four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for	223.71954398004993
their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his	216.04005821303164
sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.	339.43162731322604
Chapter XLV.	233.61875967490704
A CONJUGAL SCENE	169.77924004800337
As Athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down.	246.66377882571464
He opened the door of the room in which the Musketeers were, and found	168.87106362769492
Porthos playing an earnest game of dice with Aramis. He cast a rapid	237.09886176722773
glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.	336.32936609702506
“What has become of Monseigneur Athos?” asked he.	212.51606696080086
“Monseigneur,” replied Porthos, “he has gone as a scout, on account of	207.82103323164011
some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe.”	271.0920095287247
“And you, what have you done, Monsieur Porthos?”	326.03099317910187
“I have won five pistoles of Aramis.”	354.5366606637157
“Well; now will you return with me?”	281.6159418276703
“We are at your Eminence’s orders.”	212.64803732052042
“To horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late.”	196.16846033048083
The attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal’s horse by the	221.95046589426448
bridle. At a short distance a group of two men and three horses	187.56212241817656
appeared in the shade. These were the two men who were to conduct	210.77564097444485
Milady to Fort La Pointe, and superintend her embarkation.	312.7155082853279
The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had	208.75408371159494
already said with respect to Athos. The cardinal made an approving	220.4793765946584
gesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used	170.20904025335162
in coming.	256.4200340217383
Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his	313.1847639227409
esquire and the two Musketeers, and return to Athos.	274.6222409120175
For a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but	363.66122819743356
when out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and	197.49039790300887
came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of	354.9568929477907
the little troop. Having recognized the laced hats of his companions	347.0793081539496
and the golden fringe of the cardinal’s cloak, he waited till the	172.41611064992577
horsemen had turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of	173.75007086333835
them, he returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him	221.99955357742843
without hesitation.	312.7953450502742
The host recognized him.	200.66884561936288
“My officer,” said Athos, “has forgotten to give a piece of very	346.4065035154317
important information to the lady, and has sent me back to repair his	166.92418782831845
forgetfulness.”	258.6576626739155
“Go up,” said the host; “she is still in her chamber.”	278.62448034623503
Athos availed himself of the permission, ascended the stairs with his	227.4657688872623
lightest step, gained the landing, and through the open door perceived	212.0231372323441
Milady putting on her hat.	242.79489657726452
He entered the chamber and closed the door behind him. At the noise he	171.22138820723097
made in pushing the bolt, Milady turned round.	249.80854394220162
Athos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his	280.297907856001
hat pulled down over his eyes. On seeing this figure, mute and	292.3139028679267
immovable as a statue, Milady was frightened.	237.47840818175945
“Who are you, and what do you want?” cried she.	281.62977858359284
“Humph,” murmured Athos, “it is certainly she!”	334.43687214480326
And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward	253.07795922231563
Milady.	241.39373258702582
“Do you know me, madame?” said he.	199.7708169807051
Milady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a	181.3843835545194
serpent.	276.4903062711389
“So far, well,” said Athos, “I perceive you know me.”	190.66652312337655
“The Comte de la Fère!” murmured Milady, becoming exceedingly pale, and	215.5981734525177
drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther.	187.39542006625098
“Yes, Milady,” replied Athos; “the Comte de la Fère in person, who	239.6745445253916
comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you	170.8006662115759
a visit. Sit down, madame, and let us talk, as the cardinal said.”	314.54306503728196
Milady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without	241.65916716938403
uttering a word.	309.9371501413144
“You certainly are a demon sent upon the earth!” said Athos. “Your	338.6467597378042
power is great, I know; but you also know that with the help of God men	262.5762378703992
have often conquered the most terrible demons. You have once before	206.7958064224561
thrown yourself in my path. I thought I had crushed you, madame; but	365.9671549980186
either I was deceived or hell has resuscitated you!”	358.67767626575323
Milady at these words, which recalled frightful remembrances, hung down	305.616781960862
her head with a suppressed groan.	221.80229124263906
“Yes, hell has resuscitated you,” continued Athos. “Hell has made you	279.0860139715463
rich, hell has given you another name, hell has almost made you another	170.73241325537265
face; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the	336.5138118141873
brand from your body.”	221.86461427298678
Milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed	216.71066759333348
lightning. Athos remained sitting.	264.1326615421679
“You believed me to be dead, did you not, as I believed you to be? And	168.2348067149643
the name of Athos as well concealed the Comte de la Fère, as the name	317.0410494552741
Milady Clarik concealed Anne de Breuil. Was it not so you were called	202.02939993657748
when your honored brother married us? Our position is truly a strange	289.11600491492436
one,” continued Athos, laughing. “We have only lived up to the present	232.60154138391698
time because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance is	365.20097734964025
less oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is	253.22859134658933
sometimes devouring.”	194.7968708289506
“But,” said Milady, in a hollow, faint voice, “what brings you back to	302.3979833406302
me, and what do you want with me?”	260.661079091703
“I wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, I	209.76098378506998
have not lost sight of you.”	303.8315649357136
“You know what I have done?”	175.47551896451827
“I can relate to you, day by day, your actions from your entrance to	344.0554113649269
the service of the cardinal to this evening.”	286.75754800599526
A smile of incredulity passed over the pale lips of Milady.	232.0866522355069
“Listen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder	344.83075211072133
of the Duke of Buckingham; it was you who had Madame Bonacieux carried	241.4193862693228
off; it was you who, in love with De Wardes and thinking to pass the	173.71296347293233
night with him, opened the door to Monsieur d’Artagnan; it was you who,	171.1280356089673
believing that De Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by	178.8717118269867
his rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous	290.2778478049753
secret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom	306.2531423869323
you sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had	364.9557088243206
missed their mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make	166.91073075877435
your victim believe that the wine came from his friends. In short, it	340.79461600374066
was you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now	223.2151796803252
fill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of	236.45268082592804
Buckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made	166.1792694963023
you to allow you to assassinate D’Artagnan.”	205.59273159670593
Milady was livid.	169.54242177412834
“You must be Satan!” cried she.	321.3818339832584
“Perhaps,” said Athos; “But at all events listen well to this.	170.34958672138953
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated—I	224.69504286620375
care very little about that! I don’t know him. Besides, he is an	230.04724876115947
Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair	261.4351009449494
of D’Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I	174.11576113624167
swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have	311.94830264208184
endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.”	319.46037225671245
“Monsieur d’Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,” said Milady, in a hollow	306.0453212053885
tone; “Monsieur d’Artagnan shall die!”	356.93044054553167
“Indeed! Is it possible to insult you, madame?” said Athos, laughing;	257.7967013822461
“he has insulted you, and he shall die!”	248.08950376345086
“He shall die!” replied Milady; “she first, and he afterward.”	294.4962734224133
Athos was seized with a kind of vertigo. The sight of this creature,	174.37496830253485
who had nothing of the woman about her, recalled awful remembrances. He	343.54522773672124
thought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in	199.3758635989785
which he was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to	180.43813917313452
his honor. His desire for blood returned, burning his brain and	234.47475999789145
pervading his frame like a raging fever; he arose in his turn, reached	193.57201519154077
his hand to his belt, drew forth a pistol, and cocked it.	282.1566580857765
Milady, pale as a corpse, endeavored to cry out; but her swollen tongue	304.8518434278227
could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it	324.1767464662732
and resembled the rattle of a wild beast. Motionless against the dark	246.21409139458893
tapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image	300.9259388822381
of terror.	338.23145971697295
Athos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the	251.97158545451916
weapon almost touched Milady’s forehead, and then, in a voice the more	283.0435036073563
terrible from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution,	217.29702479092083
“Madame,” said he, “you will this instant deliver to me the paper the	185.1295930071887
cardinal signed; or upon my soul, I will blow your brains out.”	171.0533896368685
With another man, Milady might have preserved some doubt; but she knew	269.0407102031907
Athos. Nevertheless, she remained motionless.	184.47728064252857
“You have one second to decide,” said he.	301.9144404635031
Milady saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was	287.4813482831544
about to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out	232.32623221040376
a paper, and held it toward Athos.	306.8474560882536
“Take it,” said she, “and be accursed!”	326.08635132484574
Athos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the	196.5739847279203
lamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:	325.1500368716494
“Dec. 3, 1627	355.8552220529165
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of	326.42596970091915
this has done what he has done.	214.11358420180395
“RICHELIEU”	233.88374986211193
“And now,” said Athos, resuming his cloak and putting on his hat, “now	298.95380345195406
that I have drawn your teeth, viper, bite if you can.”	286.19588619586045
And he left the chamber without once looking behind him.	258.9024933004696
At the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.	190.726632878535
“Gentlemen,” said he, “Monseigneur’s order is, you know, to conduct	176.62698153947014
that woman, without losing time, to Fort La Pointe, and never to leave	297.22411254924634
her till she is on board.”	204.01584558183427
As these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they	194.7564421986537
bowed their heads in sign of assent.	225.12176761199285
With regard to Athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at	172.77968987244125
full gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the	178.67377715452008
fields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to	322.0638405601215
listen.	244.86999903931968
In one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.	253.77222337215034
He had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. He immediately made	290.44169731349893
a new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and	303.1981803272835
leaves of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred	213.65325610834842
paces from the camp.	255.87096479706156
“Who goes there?” cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.	239.3941146915613
“That is our brave Musketeer, I think,” said the cardinal.	298.2316860999173
“Yes, monseigneur,” said Porthos, “it is he.”	312.31608585168357
“Monsieur Athos,” said Richelieu, “receive my thanks for the good guard	210.1420342759963
you have kept. Gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left.	195.585378759632
The watchword is, ‘King and Ré.’”	297.3162499772054
Saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an	319.2919126554168
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his	256.6752608930168
attendant—for that night he himself slept in the camp.	283.1152195078682
“Well!” said Porthos and Aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was	213.26351088204834
out of hearing, “well, he signed the paper she required!”	314.06315424919967
“I know it,” said Athos, coolly, “since here it is.”	353.13324180456186
And the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached	238.45874816188427
their quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. Only	194.70243379784782
they sent Mousqueton to tell Planchet that his master was requested,	273.04827682220025
the instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the	183.24428475188716
Musketeers.	183.27713167534344
Milady, as Athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,	201.08002588815594
made no difficulty in following them. She had had for an instant an	185.7102870644833
inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to	257.3724100143299
him; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the	341.43675469635286
part of Athos. She might say that Athos had hanged her; but then Athos	257.15379068213826
would tell that she was branded. She thought it was best to preserve	328.3867529978793
silence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with	294.34794477337846
her usual skill; and then, all things being accomplished to the	171.6653652174163
satisfaction of the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance.	332.4062584700462
In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o’clock she	219.92482195710713
was at the fort of the Point; at eight o’clock she had embarked; and at	261.30010611506634
nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was	323.8303985880018
supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its	200.8975997809448
course toward England.	307.66722133740177
Chapter XLVI.	295.7192265064291
THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS	170.15624577092987
On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, D’Artagnan found them	342.2133237694279
assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was	230.24511510284526
twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming	211.5656891789959
little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet.	207.26531841703874
“_Pardieu_, gentlemen,” said he. “I hope what you have to tell me is	284.1645788149863
worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for	315.2325829901922
making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night	199.61657572152475
spent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there,	335.3655698953266
gentlemen? It was warm work.”	241.17907073432525
“We were in a place where it was not very cold,” replied Porthos,	237.153875850146
giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him.	270.43553550864425
“Hush!” said Athos.	175.219022443144
“Oh, oh!” said D’Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the	351.85009310897755
Musketeer. “It appears there is something fresh aboard.”	349.7636440446243
“Aramis,” said Athos, “you went to breakfast the day before yesterday	239.62342964036537
at the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?”	335.04714250370995
“Yes.”	309.88054522429354
“How did you fare?”	238.50763272252235
“For my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish	233.22618073867142
day, and they had nothing but meat.”	247.24793265292465
“What,” said Athos, “no fish at a seaport?”	343.7884409762811
“They say,” said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, “that the dyke	209.9666903656502
which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.”	217.7191711768187
“But that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,” replied Athos.	221.54323899582565
“I want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you.”	227.04101475129687
“Why, I think there were not many intruders. Yes, Athos, I know what	304.3049986704353
you mean: we shall do very well at the Parpaillot.”	248.92927936440196
“Let us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets	358.2600433166442
of paper.”	279.83795783433334
D’Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend’s manner of acting, and	175.66287821377017
who perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him,	213.66319117136797
that the circumstances were serious, took Athos’s arm, and went out	270.54555387935795
without saying anything. Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis.	292.09047740985415
On their way they met Grimaud. Athos made him a sign to come with them.	356.0317997702906
Grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had	347.5206783170805
nearly come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.	225.3926493399931
They arrived at the drinking room of the Parpaillot. It was seven	195.69810919516235
o’clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. The three friends	318.97251622291805
ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they	332.27138201788046
would not be disturbed.	172.7320430691845
Unfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. The	304.72578958487225
morning drum had just been beaten; everyone shook off the drowsiness of	335.64660615852824
night, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the	350.051927245824
inn. Dragoons, Swiss, Guardsmen, Musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded	287.1869113239967
one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host	278.23532318716224
very well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends. Thus	333.83492579590313
they applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of	296.7667426844654
their companions.	194.84110335572439
“I see how it will be,” said Athos: “we shall get into some pretty	228.59516997202036
quarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now. D’Artagnan, tell	354.56513017429927
us what sort of a night you have had, and we will describe ours	295.7174545921097
afterward.”	183.7228073949186
“Ah, yes,” said a light-horseman, with a glass of brandy in his hand,	229.25500033485974
which he sipped slowly. “I hear you gentlemen of the Guards have been	324.8432390076115
in the trenches tonight, and that you did not get much the best of the	241.4938146859202
Rochellais.”	359.9699291304955
D’Artagnan looked at Athos to know if he ought to reply to this	283.3036728534313
intruder who thus mixed unasked in their conversation.	280.39402919621085
“Well,” said Athos, “don’t you hear Monsieur de Busigny, who does you	189.11479714872064
the honor to ask you a question? Relate what has passed during the	256.5793606302761
night, since these gentlemen desire to know it.”	259.8832330457072
“Have you not taken a bastion?” said a Swiss, who was drinking rum out	288.1114892831048
of a beer glass.	244.11252656784984
“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing, “we have had that honor. We	173.96412640331002
even have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under	297.9213766454823
one of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.	266.22481398507307
Without reckoning that as the bastion was not built yesterday all the	227.47013602153794
rest of the building was badly shaken.”	174.31726131066483
“And what bastion is it?” asked a dragoon, with his saber run through a	325.5635569558184
goose which he was taking to be cooked.	338.5984896898914
“The bastion St. Gervais,” replied D’Artagnan, “from behind which the	169.41004160322055
Rochellais annoyed our workmen.”	297.26322679274347
“Was that affair hot?”	192.2114234167534
“Yes, moderately so. We lost five men, and the Rochellais eight or	268.24962148186137
ten.”	227.5746330056943
“_Balzempleu!_” said the Swiss, who, notwithstanding the admirable	265.9261111158805
collection of oaths possessed by the German language, had acquired a	255.2544306462161
habit of swearing in French.	253.7489310988541
“But it is probable,” said the light-horseman, “that they will send	265.9625737512304
pioneers this morning to repair the bastion.”	257.06616095889984
“Yes, that’s probable,” said D’Artagnan.	230.20146713098865
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “a wager!”	166.5205423516247
“Ah, _wooi_, a vager!” cried the Swiss.	360.86579023508165
“What is it?” said the light-horseman.	172.16602609506154
“Stop a bit,” said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the	219.5129600438446
two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, “stop a	171.44808558884134
bit, I am in it. You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I	175.85513808765384
may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird.”	166.4904815383295
“You was right,” said the Swiss; “goose grease is kood with basdry.”	363.42940719277595
“There!” said the dragoon. “Now for the wager! We listen, Monsieur	245.93136096249856
Athos.”	338.06409911777257
“Yes, the wager!” said the light-horseman.	179.93887899484594
“Well, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,” said Athos, “that my three	228.86175045553625
companions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan, and myself, will	243.52743323545113
go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there	200.03015279478456
an hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.”	360.67646572155616
Porthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.	345.08633210005576
“But,” said D’Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, “you are going to get us	288.4314699938783
all killed without mercy.”	220.5469689487938
“We are much more likely to be killed,” said Athos, “if we do not go.”	360.53902227405655
“My faith, gentlemen,” said Porthos, turning round upon his chair and	167.83788411510213
twisting his mustache, “that’s a fair bet, I hope.”	224.2643618734387
“I take it,” said M. de Busigny; “so let us fix the stake.”	339.6744441281855
“You are four gentlemen,” said Athos, “and we are four; an unlimited	171.85956760241274
dinner for eight. Will that do?”	232.81113530022157
“Capitally,” replied M. de Busigny.	298.7674451591065
“Perfectly,” said the dragoon.	263.0143329908514
“That shoots me,” said the Swiss.	270.0448000697638
The fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a mute	251.14057596131198
part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the	231.08158436351448
proposition.	275.5448556895595
“The breakfast for these gentlemen is ready,” said the host.	365.95621443399057
“Well, bring it,” said Athos.	242.8832490646708
The host obeyed. Athos called Grimaud, pointed to a large basket which	211.23888191223202
lay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the	181.69790235630802
napkins.	275.92945382077926
Grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the	293.31828981799606
basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the	324.8525585347933
basket on his arm.	202.0609782358409
“But where are you going to eat my breakfast?” asked the host.	313.5289954120913
“What matter, if you are paid for it?” said Athos, and he threw two	168.23106242233382
pistoles majestically on the table.	329.2191610131418
“Shall I give you the change, my officer?” said the host.	255.23102835811528
“No, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for	338.5977267205984
the napkins.”	240.11234380043402
The host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for, but	235.58177838097077
he made amends by slipping in two bottles of Anjou wine instead of two	279.419198937946
bottles of champagne.	295.87628502280984
“Monsieur de Busigny,” said Athos, “will you be so kind as to set your	283.5387015051533
watch with mine, or permit me to regulate mine by yours?”	279.58669526845296
“Which you please, monsieur!” said the light-horseman, drawing from his	206.9972423039928
fob a very handsome watch, studded with diamonds; “half past seven.”	327.50921620789796
“Thirty-five minutes after seven,” said Athos, “by which you perceive I	272.61818397667383
am five minutes faster than you.”	188.22503149280823
And bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took	281.1918011852252
the road to the bastion St. Gervais, followed by Grimaud, who carried	177.28393933479663
the basket, ignorant of where he was going but in the passive obedience	277.81623856856686
which Athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.	300.6895648981267
As long as they were within the circle of the camp, the four friends	326.49886621950156
did not exchange one word; besides, they were followed by the curious,	270.1354380467667
who, hearing of the wager, were anxious to know how they would come out	284.94186316101457
of it. But when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found	285.3998039125811
themselves in the open plain, D’Artagnan, who was completely ignorant	337.0355628896235
of what was going forward, thought it was time to demand an	362.20078817594157
explanation.	290.4837623449841
“And now, my dear Athos,” said he, “do me the kindness to tell me where	315.56994637144084
we are going?”	174.42812601959363
“Why, you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion.”	231.88107202378762
“But what are we going to do there?”	258.24480351104904
“You know well that we go to breakfast there.”	294.15866289720157
“But why did we not breakfast at the Parpaillot?”	273.22184535067885
“Because we have very important matters to communicate to one another,	333.43629233852516
and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being	259.91996463798694
annoyed by all those importunate fellows, who keep coming in, saluting	215.0613250482706
you, and addressing you. Here at least,” said Athos, pointing to the	297.7095480915226
bastion, “they will not come and disturb us.”	362.7169064272439
“It appears to me,” said D’Artagnan, with that prudence which allied	311.99954778619036
itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, “that we could have	179.2812335807994
found some retired place on the downs or the seashore.”	221.68077018302768
“Where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that	280.38011193228317
at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been	329.85824106096516
informed by his spies that we were holding a council.”	254.86338069511257
“Yes,” said Aramis, “Athos is right: _Animadvertuntur in desertis_.”	237.45956019199548
“A desert would not have been amiss,” said Porthos; “but it behooved us	358.0825917903395
to find it.”	332.3432902567512
“There is no desert where a bird cannot pass over one’s head, where a	172.0507020637461
fish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of	335.8427071336363
its burrow, and I believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a	326.2921485036891
spy of the cardinal. Better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which,	313.4267114932075
besides, we cannot retreat without shame. We have made a wager—a wager	207.1918427421004
which could not have been foreseen, and of which I defy anyone to	297.35591912384547
divine the true cause. We are going, in order to win it, to remain an	253.10900585864223
hour in the bastion. Either we shall be attacked, or not. If we are	257.94434677717726
not, we shall have all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us—for I	345.44201037078506
guarantee the walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will	296.9817034540697
talk of our affairs just the same. Moreover, in defending ourselves, we	354.9057014855166
shall cover ourselves with glory. You see that everything is to our	296.85866977529815
advantage.”	213.1795675178344
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan; “but we shall indubitably attract a ball.”	340.77959341885537
“Well, my dear,” replied Athos, “you know well that the balls most to	336.1861213842237
be dreaded are not from the enemy.”	271.0630862421395
“But for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our	189.1211144380806
muskets.”	323.5323804691491
“You are stupid, friend Porthos. Why should we load ourselves with a	312.25659715940355
useless burden?”	324.5912914411126
“I don’t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very	278.17661423758466
useless in the face of an enemy.”	363.46759080274757
“Well,” replied Athos, “have you not heard what D’Artagnan said?”	177.6350926766939
“What did he say?” demanded Porthos.	202.74993294857816
“D’Artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten	206.7750918783131
Frenchmen were killed, and as many Rochellais.”	210.27145224845316
“What then?”	175.36433486616264
“The bodies were not plundered, were they? It appears the conquerors	200.36385702279094
had something else to do.”	337.00944356177183
“Well?”	316.34074069777944
“Well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;	339.7960918397705
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen	272.02876511698423
guns and a hundred charges to fire.”	183.59682672429577
“Oh, Athos!” said Aramis, “truly you are a great man.”	202.3565187715754
Porthos nodded in sign of agreement. D’Artagnan alone did not seem	283.79847108293984
convinced.	184.17690681028162
Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing	345.9023778913702
that they continued to advance toward the bastion—something he had till	291.79887531781185
then doubted—he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.	311.3736608470448
“Where are we going?” asked he, by a gesture.	302.8196280862119
Athos pointed to the bastion.	282.7448600055463
“But,” said Grimaud, in the same silent dialect, “we shall leave our	235.18634475574845
skins there.”	298.8751771342842
Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.	170.4389282270775
Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the	172.3394343283431
head.	183.3889543876599
Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly	173.6650903183067
primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud’s ear.	265.05181729869
Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him a	240.3623751901697
sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All	198.35734779860468
that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the	363.25143388988783
rear guard to the vanguard.	221.30534604985306
Arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.	288.77817015153477
More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the	302.9240264191964
gate of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de	297.1554067890859
Busigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor.	312.8363555333312
Athos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it	257.90479270564043
in the air.	332.2328460546829
All the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy	190.248031030933
with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four	289.96225798227795
disappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them.	166.24912713548798
Chapter XLVII.	297.1926037006409
THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS	236.91395093055166
As Athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen	188.13631927614153
corpses, French and Rochellais.	263.3044453733083
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition,	360.88938581886526
“while Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns	233.16570858627153
and cartridges together. We can talk while performing that necessary	275.42826167594865
task. These gentlemen,” added he, pointing to the bodies, “cannot hear	317.213224102444
us.”	288.7477499224869
“But we could throw them into the ditch,” said Porthos, “after having	226.65393580123595
assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets.”	185.56728940318771
“Yes,” said Athos, “that’s Grimaud’s business.”	304.0344968336749
“Well, then,” cried D’Artagnan, “pray let Grimaud search them and throw	168.54024194765114
them over the walls.”	290.423581149713
“Heaven forfend!” said Athos; “they may serve us.”	248.06407301777466
“These bodies serve us?” said Porthos. “You are mad, dear friend.”	297.10230575807765
“Judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,” replied Athos.	217.9258171803427
“How many guns, gentlemen?”	281.02185269562574
“Twelve,” replied Aramis.	327.8426616209897
“How many shots?”	267.12556420141414
“A hundred.”	175.4378084337314
“That’s quite as many as we shall want. Let us load the guns.”	359.3962026446287
The four Musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last	237.41525054324552
musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.	214.6287184444743
Athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to	197.39004614137068
Grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that	275.72598636459554
he was to stand as sentinel. Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the	253.5649867564735
duty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of	240.6206630837416
wine.	324.8854750972589
“And now to table,” said Athos.	256.9729917778848
The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs	271.3367826207717
crossed like Turks, or even tailors.	233.67389907542713
“And now,” said D’Artagnan, “as there is no longer any fear of being	361.6915011537424
overheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.”	167.65173225207735
“I hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory,	216.7203539382191
gentlemen,” said Athos. “I have induced you to take a charming	176.77852241675612
promenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred	255.2251214505644
persons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or	342.33281136399717
madmen—two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.”	229.04607348230002
“But the secret!” said D’Artagnan.	168.8400339201224
“The secret is,” said Athos, “that I saw Milady last night.”	296.6697699158112
D’Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady,	258.95196714424264
his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the	265.57021559785306
ground again for fear of spilling the contents.”	250.91373145215357
“You saw your wi—”	298.87535919262547
“Hush!” interrupted Athos. “You forget, my dear, you forget that these	186.17597128476703
gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I	178.54973233903615
have seen Milady.”	343.82420099531714
“Where?” demanded D’Artagnan.	237.93732357106413
“Within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.”	234.12226070724935
“In that case I am lost,” said D’Artagnan.	176.73589396988987
“Not so bad yet,” replied Athos; “for by this time she must have quit	244.49244991880408
the shores of France.”	274.04058077382956
D’Artagnan breathed again.	252.35931263333316
“But after all,” asked Porthos, “who is Milady?”	228.0166546050095
“A charming woman!” said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.	282.2068177333168
“Villainous host!” cried he, “he has given us Anjou wine instead of	261.9304101220322
champagne, and fancies we know no better! Yes,” continued he, “a	176.59553535780555
charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend	177.06549068721716
D’Artagnan, who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she	218.51396886678896
tried to revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket	276.7576923066516
shots, a week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding	315.54577171854055
his head of the cardinal.”	330.21874563175265
“What! by demanding my head of the cardinal?” cried D’Artagnan, pale	359.7054415218315
with terror.	237.77564711723915
“Yes, that is true as the Gospel,” said Porthos; “I heard her with my	362.84360369633225
own ears.”	311.1030914800057
“I also,” said Aramis.	272.0917849196726
“Then,” said D’Artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, “it	270.08918102522637
is useless to struggle longer. I may as well blow my brains out, and	357.6918442726591
all will be over.”	266.9550238228759
“That’s the last folly to be committed,” said Athos, “seeing it is the	241.8290934587714
only one for which there is no remedy.”	274.92841703585
“But I can never escape,” said D’Artagnan, “with such enemies. First,	359.5581781556733
my stranger of Meung; then De Wardes, to whom I have given three sword	211.2128713182133
wounds; next Milady, whose secret I have discovered; finally, the	282.83232448473836
cardinal, whose vengeance I have balked.”	228.59922598790254
“Well,” said Athos, “that only makes four; and we are four—one for one.	311.33348363653846
_Pardieu!_ if we may believe the signs Grimaud is making, we are about	187.71681111711928
to have to do with a very different number of people. What is it,	358.76120794930637
Grimaud? Considering the gravity of the occasion, I permit you to	281.83116479407215
speak, my friend; but be laconic, I beg. What do you see?”	263.71567490868847
“A troop.”	235.8485762743395
“Of how many persons?”	317.4293295873707
“Twenty men.”	344.54838421401075
“What sort of men?”	210.1632784529787
“Sixteen pioneers, four soldiers.”	218.53724436577485
“How far distant?”	266.4021793064158
“Five hundred paces.”	196.0885310584073
“Good! We have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of	209.8121988002386
wine to your health, D’Artagnan.”	291.5674006831618
“To your health!” repeated Porthos and Aramis.	315.70555282598883
“Well, then, to my health! although I am very much afraid that your	245.4665412749838
good wishes will not be of great service to me.”	168.56242503573696
“Bah!” said Athos, “God is great, as say the followers of Mohammed, and	247.19727432197553
the future is in his hands.”	194.18765868619766
Then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to	245.49564877238873
him, Athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near	347.99869054569047
to one of the loopholes.	204.43839121664115
Porthos, Aramis and D’Artagnan followed his example. As to Grimaud, he	277.0450098580596
received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to	198.46528203745885
reload their weapons.	193.72094761163387
“_Pardieu!_” said Athos, “it was hardly worth while to distribute	204.89579017416168
ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and	175.6226017237445
shovels. Grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and I am	286.0553700404083
convinced they would have left us in peace.”	342.65025791107314
“I doubt that,” replied D’Artagnan, “for they are advancing very	297.6797815394436
resolutely. Besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four	365.232712850489
soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets.”	360.5510985194004
“That’s because they don’t see us,” said Athos.	300.73367513120405
“My faith,” said Aramis, “I must confess I feel a great repugnance to	223.04208897499814
fire on these poor devils of civilians.”	206.30558158046753
“He is a bad priest,” said Porthos, “who has pity for heretics.”	315.1900804951087
“In truth,” said Athos, “Aramis is right. I will warn them.”	257.89828007646986
“What the devil are you going to do?” cried D’Artagnan, “you will be	313.73173835306574
shot.”	245.70621539468067
But Athos heeded not his advice. Mounting on the breach, with his	197.20948001957174
musket in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing	348.2154482229171
courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who,	179.84554933906978
astonished at this apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion:	365.1855284843498
“Gentlemen, a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this	310.4042977149598
bastion. Now, you know nothing is more disagreeable than being	179.34698073495744
disturbed when one is at breakfast. We request you, then, if you really	335.6025639745857
have business here, to wait till we have finished our repast, or to	199.3374637128055
come again a short time hence; unless, which would be far better, you	299.0347377820334
form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come	224.55365622420734
and drink with us to the health of the King of France.”	264.77807793600067
“Take care, Athos!” cried D’Artagnan; “don’t you see they are aiming?”	252.39796609711027
“Yes, yes,” said Athos; “but they are only civilians—very bad marksmen,	208.6008233750107
who will be sure not to hit me.”	296.3106152325771
In fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were	298.8488970564597
flattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him.	226.6890397458666
Four shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better	345.9801354102494
aimed than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one	176.07666441611178
of the pioneers was wounded.	202.121846476684
“Grimaud,” said Athos, still on the breach, “another musket!”	283.91313141029536
Grimaud immediately obeyed. On their part, the three friends had	314.7357516245195
reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. The	314.04773582356216
brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to	337.76664833505083
flight.	310.1691777473686
“Now, gentlemen, a _sortie!_” cried Athos.	362.4928822245921
And the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of	348.65835656012916
battle, picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of	221.8503220523873
the brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till	266.82537304343157
they reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with	343.21361302152997
them the trophies of their victory.	242.1369757008231
“Reload the muskets, Grimaud,” said Athos, “and we, gentlemen, will go	243.52613660955006
on with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. Where were we?”	182.46986950648878
“I recollect you were saying,” said D’Artagnan, “that after having	228.489878745701
demanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France.	332.8485849889995
Whither goes she?” added he, strongly interested in the route Milady	301.2748500798806
followed.	321.0910067926199
“She goes into England,” said Athos.	329.11786952607645
“With what view?”	300.28178180147756
“With the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the	210.3689417704872
Duke of Buckingham.”	176.76703772599913
D’Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.	296.57583954989536
“But this is infamous!” cried he.	248.65208248111378
“As to that,” said Athos, “I beg you to believe that I care very little	184.66715234906587
about it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier’s half-pike,	347.288942807266
tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these	264.89735337939067
rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and	357.0927133896904
loyal soldiers of the king.”	213.86815121667874
Grimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag	270.0257012900536
was floating over the heads of the four friends. A thunder of applause	282.6342085801888
saluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.	342.83784159194283
“How?” replied D’Artagnan, “you care little if she kills Buckingham or	202.74190581481588
causes him to be killed? But the duke is our friend.”	179.608729924527
“The duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she	258.3818291649401
likes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.”	292.1801521260551
And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he	342.9767309826657
had poured the last drop into his glass.	323.719800764559
“A moment,” said D’Artagnan. “I will not abandon Buckingham thus. He	272.2144851224209
gave us some very fine horses.”	225.9679823367038
“And moreover, very handsome saddles,” said Porthos, who at the moment	224.20228701870064
wore on his cloak the lace of his own.	259.8125093713245
“Besides,” said Aramis, “God desires the conversion and not the death	199.85472892804108
of a sinner.”	180.17718358650956
“Amen!” said Athos, “and we will return to that subject later, if such	265.3452976376473
be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most	222.50135008945645
earnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, D’Artagnan, was the	365.63615135961174
getting from this woman a kind of _carte blanche_ which she had	202.3587977756389
extorted from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with	168.61872004216275
impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us.”	262.75111831595865
“But this creature must be a demon!” said Porthos, holding out his	295.953462057263
plate to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.	323.40222280176823
“And this _carte blanche_,” said D’Artagnan, “this _carte blanche_,	324.8026838002188
does it remain in her hands?”	219.27210800849664
“No, it passed into mine; I will not say without trouble, for if I did	170.93242430618176
I should tell a lie.”	272.58862164769425
“My dear Athos, I shall no longer count the number of times I am	272.5173780752592
indebted to you for my life.”	292.29522303026016
“Then it was to go to her that you left us?” said Aramis.	298.7317934627016
“Exactly.”	172.07740417369388
“And you have that letter of the cardinal?” said D’Artagnan.	183.52670612769404
“Here it is,” said Athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the	232.39627355558434
pocket of his uniform. D’Artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose	236.99470489855554
trembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:	322.48128742773605
“Dec. 3, 1627	291.03064637882153
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of	240.72841495492867
this has done what he has done.	216.82024225434333
“RICHELIEU”	191.86679018519254
“In fact,” said Aramis, “it is an absolution according to rule.”	299.7556321518612
“That paper must be torn to pieces,” said D’Artagnan, who fancied he	246.41033501955448
read in it his sentence of death.	361.2810815330091
“On the contrary,” said Athos, “it must be preserved carefully. I would	231.64837393747635
not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces.”	311.9307168359161
“And what will she do now?” asked the young man.	247.44567105254424
“Why,” replied Athos, carelessly, “she is probably going to write to	254.2103015415272
the cardinal that a damned Musketeer, named Athos, has taken her	200.4144335457674
safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter	292.0100399692886
to get rid of his two friends, Aramis and Porthos, at the same time.	219.48339758087525
The cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often	289.1319933789
crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest D’Artagnan,	216.25619481978583
and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company	236.80256221083152
in the Bastille.”	312.9596214780556
“Go to! It appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear,” said Porthos.	337.2347982349084
“I do not jest,” said Athos.	231.8760372798808
“Do you know,” said Porthos, “that to twist that damned Milady’s neck	279.4668470066757
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of	327.4443670082403
Huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in French the	178.43921249491342
psalms we sing in Latin?”	175.1853859439728
“What says the abbé?” asked Athos, quietly.	214.39637607602117
“I say I am entirely of Porthos’s opinion,” replied Aramis.	308.7553282912156
“And I, too,” said D’Artagnan.	198.3837171516275
“Fortunately, she is far off,” said Porthos, “for I confess she would	206.05233793374953
worry me if she were here.”	201.22333845533274
“She worries me in England as well as in France,” said Athos.	267.8749291419048
“She worries me everywhere,” said D’Artagnan.	170.35327428935764
“But when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,	291.4324383871621
strangle her, hang her?” said Porthos. “It is only the dead who do not	205.06891174955285
return.”	276.8665497136632
“You think so, Porthos?” replied the Musketeer, with a sad smile which	238.74309121011203
D’Artagnan alone understood.	313.24754985184984
“I have an idea,” said D’Artagnan.	176.45135643614782
“What is it?” said the Musketeers.	222.8235338496664
“To arms!” cried Grimaud.	350.3983971636233
The young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.	166.9977462570601
This time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to	290.6305240882439
twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the	346.98723639829296
garrison.	295.2444960933359
“Shall we return to the camp?” said Porthos. “I don’t think the sides	297.20649621536666
are equal.”	173.8239877337879
“Impossible, for three reasons,” replied Athos. “The first, that we	222.05183513831287
have not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very	186.73149261220792
important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes	193.88308303670334
before the lapse of the hour.”	254.0089357319214
“Well, then,” said Aramis, “we must form a plan of battle.”	280.4217715966433
“That’s very simple,” replied Athos. “As soon as the enemy are within	243.92042109254226
musket shot, we must fire upon them. If they continue to advance, we	335.5447942862862
must fire again. We must fire as long as we have loaded guns. If those	251.6938369773615
who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow	251.07240602229413
the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down	204.47088254883283
upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a	236.71819007853335
miracle.”	344.28954510470794
“Bravo!” cried Porthos. “Decidedly, Athos, you were born to be a	218.95003981796563
general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is	321.41161541131214
nothing beside you.”	235.29042491614948
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “no divided attention, I beg; let each one	231.7491839457866
pick out his man.”	258.13460318401656
“I cover mine,” said D’Artagnan.	209.93128880268262
“And I mine,” said Porthos.	274.30619922319784
“And I _idem_,” said Aramis.	362.96200780555034
“Fire, then,” said Athos.	344.7515081408931
The four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.	331.6444254255673
The drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging	270.1528225746405
pace.	294.441436456805
Then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with	275.93256854255117
the same accuracy. Nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the	212.11411874969812
numerical weakness of the friends, the Rochellais continued to advance	257.3301974406064
in quick time.	167.18326257620572
With every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those	255.7306071921384
who remained was not slackened.	312.7299696257892
Arrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen	230.13535160713076
of the enemy. A last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them;	239.04089726781643
they jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.	238.43899269978903
“Now, my friends,” said Athos, “finish them at a blow. To the wall; to	314.9291271341515
the wall!”	286.83852259281844
And the four friends, seconded by Grimaud, pushed with the barrels of	269.84009731495246
their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by	192.17911516026453
the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible	166.80800511154592
crash into the ditch. Then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust	226.4046141082681
mounted toward the sky—and all was over!	166.80385550558682
“Can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?” said	176.25098798759086
Athos.	206.96858523604237
“My faith, it appears so!” said D’Artagnan.	171.66914900502186
“No,” cried Porthos; “there go three or four, limping away.”	269.19248007607933
In fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and	294.1769575550792
blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city.	268.55579142162003
These were all who were left of the little troop.	333.20951905678044
Athos looked at his watch.	353.59137860232727
“Gentlemen,” said he, “we have been here an hour, and our wager is won;	284.94090676966067
but we will be fair players. Besides, D’Artagnan has not told us his	333.11673184753874
idea yet.”	231.83867462409074
And the Musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the	181.33003532677589
remains of the breakfast.	177.09913691929992
“My idea?” said D’Artagnan.	326.37704739288415
“Yes; you said you had an idea,” said Athos.	313.1756894112287
“Oh, I remember,” said D’Artagnan. “Well, I will go to England a second	214.68279639926482
time; I will go and find Buckingham.”	206.69941647393694
“You shall not do that, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, coolly.	216.62299610095573
“And why not? Have I not been there once?”	223.03415453024118
“Yes; but at that period we were not at war. At that period Buckingham	268.18396644368545
was an ally, and not an enemy. What you would now do amounts to	246.18242055623364
treason.”	315.22681107339724
D’Artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.	181.79125923986425
“But,” said Porthos, “I think I have an idea, in my turn.”	249.92957539705878
“Silence for Monsieur Porthos’s idea!” said Aramis.	226.98085944771054
“I will ask leave of absence of Monsieur de Tréville, on some pretext	207.31529656811014
or other which you must invent; I am not very clever at pretexts.	309.67164926190367
Milady does not know me; I will get access to her without her	231.18814652434313
suspecting me, and when I catch my beauty, I will strangle her.”	260.1506821231702
“Well,” replied Athos, “I am not far from approving the idea of	188.2379295518098
Monsieur Porthos.”	214.69870421584602
“For shame!” said Aramis. “Kill a woman? No, listen to me; I have the	233.17220912821807
true idea.”	256.0285885183538
“Let us see your idea, Aramis,” said Athos, who felt much deference for	327.7938088056698
the young Musketeer.	322.59448684164533
“We must inform the queen.”	342.23973955984013
“Ah, my faith, yes!” said Porthos and D’Artagnan, at the same time; “we	225.12036072292017
are coming nearer to it now.”	312.84797043414676
“Inform the queen!” said Athos; “and how? Have we relations with the	344.97459345857396
court? Could we send anyone to Paris without its being known in the	326.54906349121313
camp? From here to Paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our	318.9159403038384
letter was at Angers we should be in a dungeon.”	251.13926140282643
“As to remitting a letter with safety to her Majesty,” said Aramis,	325.54360343716775
coloring, “I will take that upon myself. I know a clever person at	201.44377106306212
Tours—”	282.3968102509071
Aramis stopped on seeing Athos smile.	229.58895265544305
“Well, do you not adopt this means, Athos?” said D’Artagnan.	293.46615710730646
“I do not reject it altogether,” said Athos; “but I wish to remind	209.3807306459476
Aramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of	363.40824835889316
ourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set	279.8607560314573
out, all the Capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the	222.75778436359244
cardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever	174.1203345439731
person will be arrested.”	315.9818977706858
“Without reckoning,” objected Porthos, “that the queen would save	258.4864399070691
Monsieur de Buckingham, but would take no heed of us.”	209.75808002297651
“Gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “what Porthos says is full of sense.”	289.88331845972783
“Ah, ah! but what’s going on in the city yonder?” said Athos.	314.91824238440233
“They are beating the general alarm.”	288.0863975290143
The four friends listened, and the sound of the drum plainly reached	168.5665506682111
them.	187.90566454344784
“You see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us,” said	309.1268141618157
Athos.	272.84335234891455
“You don’t think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?” said	321.63772750055944
Porthos.	301.07471886311953
“Why not?” said the Musketeer. “I feel myself quite in a humor for it;	326.23590642370095
and I would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to	227.96448653503313
bring a dozen more bottles of wine.”	358.28772835400457
“Upon my word, the drum draws near,” said D’Artagnan.	250.8726756000541
“Let it come,” said Athos. “It is a quarter of an hour’s journey from	178.82678230951288
here to the city, consequently a quarter of an hour’s journey from the	208.75592226977034
city to hither. That is more than time enough for us to devise a plan.	219.54605260878242
If we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable. Ah,	304.09976809441775
stop! I have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me.”	323.20033811399344
“Tell us.”	364.5146673053383
“Allow me to give Grimaud some indispensable orders.”	250.69610737760812
Athos made a sign for his lackey to approach.	349.57358020468064
“Grimaud,” said Athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall	234.26262527857546
of the bastion, “take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall,	262.5145665702854
put their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands.”	276.6852551113288
“Oh, the great man!” cried D’Artagnan. “I comprehend now.”	317.35456172291407
“You comprehend?” said Porthos.	258.8930819731387
“And do you comprehend, Grimaud?” said Aramis.	335.5647718124575
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative.	203.77969922379066
“That’s all that is necessary,” said Athos; “now for my idea.”	224.7822094774333
“I should like, however, to comprehend,” said Porthos.	240.0774310918403
“That is useless.”	302.868466127395
“Yes, yes! Athos’s idea!” cried Aramis and D’Artagnan, at the same	258.01258832040423
time.	227.81379284152905
“This Milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a	200.74257742186035
brother-in-law, as I think you told me, D’Artagnan?”	262.58619139553264
“Yes, I know him very well; and I also believe that he has not a very	245.0466790956977
warm affection for his sister-in-law.”	313.54401750631405
“There is no harm in that. If he detested her, it would be all the	275.48178328539
better,” replied Athos.	166.7761368423552
“In that case we are as well off as we wish.”	257.15421749291824
“And yet,” said Porthos, “I would like to know what Grimaud is about.”	307.3544843696419
“Silence, Porthos!” said Aramis.	275.34485317269946
“What is her brother-in-law’s name?”	171.45230745157414
“Lord de Winter.”	220.93030215538136
“Where is he now?”	279.56403280693667
“He returned to London at the first sound of war.”	250.03260775590215
“Well, there’s just the man we want,” said Athos. “It is he whom we	193.18805224712403
must warn. We will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the	274.1472802766892
point of having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of	322.48188881184376
her. There is in London, I hope, some establishment like that of the	222.39415494317223
Magdalens, or of the Repentant Daughters. He must place his sister in	303.34009455785167
one of these, and we shall be in peace.”	229.8503418226441
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “till she comes out.”	293.84876490554524
“Ah, my faith!” said Athos, “you require too much, D’Artagnan. I have	237.59564682458657
given you all I have, and I beg leave to tell you that this is the	338.4855079766389
bottom of my sack.”	272.82587363574805
“But I think it would be still better,” said Aramis, “to inform the	174.6223605177173
queen and Lord de Winter at the same time.”	306.3406125778775
“Yes; but who is to carry the letter to Tours, and who to London?”	316.7057286451369
“I answer for Bazin,” said Aramis.	222.36807904579052
“And I for Planchet,” said D’Artagnan.	307.1826911958816
“Ay,” said Porthos, “if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may.”	253.71907331104228
“To be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters,”	260.03957826267856
said Aramis. “Give the lackeys money, and they will start.”	173.97702352224866
“We will give them money?” replied Athos. “Have you any money?”	219.95605265478542
The four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows	220.55963718712752
which but lately had been so cheerful.	232.99340699199246
“Look out!” cried D’Artagnan, “I see black points and red points moving	351.83068233428276
yonder. Why did you talk of a regiment, Athos? It is a veritable army!”	167.8049521685755
“My faith, yes,” said Athos; “there they are. See the sneaks come,	210.33651099936313
without drum or trumpet. Ah, ah! have you finished, Grimaud?”	279.26983178122714
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies	306.4334246945074
which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. Some carried	171.2399852990993
arms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely	222.97543167393488
to be sword in hand.	172.71980701643292
“Bravo!” said Athos; “that does honor to your imagination.”	271.80923671894186
“All very well,” said Porthos, “but I should like to understand.”	224.20688758819733
“Let us decamp first, and you will understand afterward.”	256.5034477964298
“A moment, gentlemen, a moment; give Grimaud time to clear away the	291.422609341462
breakfast.”	349.41750931167354
“Ah, ah!” said Aramis, “the black points and the red points are visibly	251.85834197399896
enlarging. I am of D’Artagnan’s opinion; we have no time to lose in	262.5214946005497
regaining our camp.”	362.3809886568646
“My faith,” said Athos, “I have nothing to say against a retreat. We	271.9698283373268
bet upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. Nothing can	172.79870585915293
be said; let us be off, gentlemen, let us be off!”	231.52211976568913
Grimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. The four	274.7651031694475
friends followed, ten paces behind him.	256.47611750201577
“What the devil shall we do now, gentlemen?” cried Athos.	329.9164198760382
“Have you forgotten anything?” said Aramis.	341.95723573006455
“The white flag, _morbleu!_ We must not leave a flag in the hands of	263.19719872564076
the enemy, even if that flag be but a napkin.”	259.15760649779116
And Athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off	326.5494800996104
the flag; but as the Rochellais had arrived within musket range, they	220.85132677672078
opened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself	298.89685056197686
for pleasure’s sake.	284.5908835334285
But Athos might be said to bear a charmed life. The balls passed and	312.5841609562119
whistled all around him; not one struck him.	316.3116133177185
Athos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and	344.28900457798215
saluting those of the camp. On both sides loud cries arose—on the one	317.61365345098693
side cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.	357.8661724606138
A second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing	302.2471664454732
through it, made the napkin really a flag. Cries were heard from the	352.6363175739135
camp, “Come down! come down!”	190.71781954948977
Athos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him	349.5828790728949
returned with joy.	311.1080781347083
“Come along, Athos, come along!” cried D’Artagnan; “now we have found	353.82122148126234
everything except money, it would be stupid to be killed.”	280.24747901240454
But Athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his	211.95005358480097
companions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated	211.26577578399056
their pace by his.	257.77566234067655
Grimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the	334.40660183411643
balls.	219.78958678676403
At the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.	275.19696102307887
“What’s that?” asked Porthos, “what are they firing at now? I hear no	276.6831238579958
balls whistle, and I see nobody!”	219.3673956943503
“They are firing at the corpses,” replied Athos.	220.41635220680968
“But the dead cannot return their fire.”	363.100975505893
“Certainly not! They will then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will	291.5512623897034
deliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we	210.96818180912385
shall be out of the range of their balls. That renders it useless to	223.43075024360184
get a pleurisy by too much haste.”	239.9701553318189
“Oh, I comprehend now,” said the astonished Porthos.	248.98444759740653
“That’s lucky,” said Athos, shrugging his shoulders.	313.61944519338044
On their part, the French, on seeing the four friends return at such a	363.5101478979768
step, uttered cries of enthusiasm.	299.9954101911228
At length a fresh discharge was heard, and this time the balls came	290.1999170578165
rattling among the stones around the four friends, and whistling	217.13506723000748
sharply in their ears. The Rochellais had at last taken possession of	257.12188423519854
the bastion.	252.9872942256308
“These Rochellais are bungling fellows,” said Athos; “how many have we	357.2413539270249
killed of them—a dozen?”	311.8748833260027
“Or fifteen.”	229.52845109878092
“How many did we crush under the wall?”	334.0215555881181
“Eight or ten.”	198.9086393352446
“And in exchange for all that not even a scratch! Ah, but what is the	297.54479085798675
matter with your hand, D’Artagnan? It bleeds, seemingly.”	180.46445075826944
“Oh, it’s nothing,” said D’Artagnan.	232.12509577535138
“A spent ball?”	339.13722420942037
“Not even that.”	325.13605243307745
“What is it, then?”	331.4136950656381
We have said that Athos loved D’Artagnan like a child, and this somber	221.02724869152368
and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young	185.06880954702893
man.	358.18128068457503
“Only grazed a little,” replied D’Artagnan; “my fingers were caught	351.1457510475435
between two stones—that of the wall and that of my ring—and the skin	232.71136117061957
was broken.”	352.00999034640887
“That comes of wearing diamonds, my master,” said Athos, disdainfully.	233.54687521865765
“Ah, to be sure,” cried Porthos, “there is a diamond. Why the devil,	245.0689577149239
then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?”	311.6546907412353
“Stop a bit!” said Aramis.	234.31781624930312
“Well thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.”	354.4222139993475
“Undoubtedly,” said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos’s compliment;	225.6775867581386
“as there is a diamond, let us sell it.”	363.112278886951
“But,” said D’Artagnan, “it is the queen’s diamond.”	280.2589709814696
“The stronger reason why it should be sold,” replied Athos. “The queen	224.43313976478424
saving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. The queen	322.78931200093473
saving us, her friends; nothing more moral. Let us sell the diamond.	220.36182813263395
What says Monsieur the Abbé? I don’t ask Porthos; his opinion has been	317.9494541561372
given.”	302.1038736105006
“Why, I think,” said Aramis, blushing as usual, “that his ring not	176.87156488042768
coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,	308.5287715196002
D’Artagnan may sell it.”	191.48162375951816
“My dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified. Your advice,	320.70752402200026
then, is—”	266.37227495608937
“To sell the diamond,” replied Aramis.	219.35561132988437
“Well, then,” said D’Artagnan, gaily, “let us sell the diamond, and say	307.17834511877754
no more about it.”	278.97192586280744
The fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and	330.4808244390118
the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.	330.69582536035614
“My faith, it was time that idea came into Porthos’s head. Here we are	174.79214534985636
at the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. We	268.49210815828985
are observed; they are coming to meet us. We shall be carried in	356.72066190246807
triumph.”	263.29894300209895
In fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. More than two	169.33028525764198
thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but	227.70530237158903
wild undertaking of the four friends—an undertaking of which they were	364.6541063285647
far from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cries of	298.95740140323846
“Live the Musketeers! Live the Guards!” M. de Busigny was the first to	217.93720697003752
come and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was	322.2628638045155
lost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades	260.625291658598
followed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but	222.6488155151972
felicitations, pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to	230.57107466757145
the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length	321.6217521834053
became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and	242.67553600983396
sent La Houdinière, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was	324.6350663943567
going on.	345.230427367449
The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of	312.6735894225902
enthusiasm.	182.65387610214106
“Well?” asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdinière return.	289.6609097735553
“Well, monseigneur,” replied the latter, “three Musketeers and a	189.75397582563014
Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and	310.8128456403456
breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held	338.71645230469215
it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don’t know how	203.9487974848359
many Rochellais.”	340.4369147534592
“Did you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?”	289.8441814800631
“Yes, monseigneur.”	166.6955612897765
“What are their names?”	249.07932950415406
“Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.”	208.4094686049063
“Still my three brave fellows!” murmured the cardinal. “And the	354.2426681531118
Guardsman?”	206.3014896922522
“D’Artagnan.”	234.9011469750559
“Still my young scapegrace. Positively, these four men must be on my	268.61731186410884
side.”	214.37038471691903
The same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Tréville of the exploit of	357.13743394793244
the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. M. de Tréville, who	181.0599029451465
had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes	194.43384417900768
of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting	315.95382433016914
the episode of the napkin.	274.6455325047313
“That’s well, Monsieur de Tréville,” said the cardinal; “pray let that	192.284072525846
napkin be sent to me. I will have three _fleur-de-lis_ embroidered on	181.4058405935521
it in gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.”	238.7416191553296
“Monseigneur,” said M. de Tréville, “that will be unjust to the	298.7995079025468
Guardsmen. Monsieur d’Artagnan is not with me; he serves under Monsieur	185.2767627876391
Dessessart.”	288.48530497534375
“Well, then, take him,” said the cardinal; “when four men are so much	304.6498285186772
attached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the	280.5448560737241
same company.”	356.04428672624863
That same evening M. de Tréville announced this good news to the three	273.1092416911495
Musketeers and D’Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next	301.82698561931977
morning.	281.83562216476685
D’Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his	178.97670885486258
life had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise	359.4864449585232
greatly delighted.	294.20348799526266
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan to Athos, “you had a triumphant idea! As	270.996474043231
you said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a	190.08118644201778
conversation of the highest importance.”	208.95293925617142
“Which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the	325.007184342991
help of God, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists.”	339.7568393939554
That evening D’Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart,	234.49235706014292
and inform him of his promotion.	253.42569038205176
M. Dessessart, who esteemed D’Artagnan, made him offers of help, as	327.7132402098411
this change would entail expenses for equipment.	248.09389917701634
D’Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged	232.64981357291725
him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to	214.5857473984767
turn it into money.	249.18329276886982
The next day, M. Dessessart’s valet came to D’Artagnan’s lodging, and	318.3999624571268
gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.	328.29738834354475
This was the price of the queen’s diamond.	313.7408814642197
Chapter XLVIII.	337.50933654639584
A FAMILY AFFAIR	206.46665257945216
Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not	183.95615133909348
subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned	356.306182793011
nobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all	331.33440784236745
the world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, _family affair_.	269.62455546273577
Aramis had discovered the idea, _the lackeys_.	256.0135503338713
Porthos had discovered the means, _the diamond_.	365.5276541964346
D’Artagnan alone had discovered nothing—he, ordinarily the most	194.5121270733953
inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of	262.5240645022505
Milady paralyzed him.	338.3324140494141
Ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his	288.56850701505016
diamond.	197.69909361629692
The breakfast at M. de Tréville’s was as gay and cheerful as possible.	331.3688530372343
D’Artagnan already wore his uniform—for being nearly of the same size	241.54604188935036
as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who	259.23520245555704
purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold	269.1288414898696
his friend a complete outfit.	269.945478064353
D’Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not	277.7449763997974
constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.	305.0887083655897
After breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the	332.7099106089484
evening at Athos’s lodging, and there finish their plans.	179.35049908258844
D’Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer’s uniform in	224.66902459191397
every street of the camp.	200.59631802885596
In the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only	308.15162831579
remained three things to decide—what they should write to Milady’s	297.88023418191653
brother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and	218.4219791841567
which should be the lackeys to carry the letters.	268.29931036875433
Everyone offered his own. Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud,	312.8307185557745
who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. Porthos	256.9362476030517
boasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash	196.529936472349
four men of ordinary size. Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin,	297.6345428299218
made a pompous eulogium on his candidate. Finally, D’Artagnan had	197.18461114244047
entire faith in the bravery of Planchet, and reminded them of the	220.2629202729798
manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of	362.3316874737146
Boulogne.	226.126756959494
These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave	305.0316358370274
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they	220.18966549396484
should be deemed too long.	284.69994905528006
“Unfortunately,” said Athos, “he whom we send must possess in himself	277.91187513432465
alone the four qualities united.”	314.55538429966947
“But where is such a lackey to be found?”	224.25998987409946
“Not to be found!” cried Athos. “I know it well, so take Grimaud.”	272.24561610142297
“Take Mousqueton.”	272.1785577464725
“Take Bazin.”	333.9540626843084
“Take Planchet. Planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities	348.5041045945966
out of the four.”	295.86995166403756
“Gentlemen,” said Aramis, “the principal question is not to know which	266.9278905586344
of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most	359.74325857088485
clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves	192.25620102447365
money the best.”	241.55767988592
“What Aramis says is very sensible,” replied Athos; “we must speculate	341.9909678691813
upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. Monsieur Abbé,	176.86374053752698
you are a great moralist.”	239.280945240161
“Doubtless,” said Aramis, “for we not only require to be well served in	230.59585280194125
order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,	258.5926404237472
heads are in question, not for our lackeys—”	344.7589135239589
“Speak lower, Aramis,” said Athos.	198.10436545997803
“That’s wise—not for the lackeys,” resumed Aramis, “but for the	289.17231723117413
master—for the _masters_, we may say. Are our lackeys sufficiently	317.37911716744327
devoted to us to risk their lives for us? No.”	213.91625535588395
“My faith,” said D’Artagnan. “I would almost answer for Planchet.”	296.00084584917283
“Well, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of	304.71474347331593
money, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him	351.8102710086322
twice.”	328.0205507159152
“Why, good God! you will be deceived just the same,” said Athos, who	243.99718474230556
was an optimist when things were concerned, and a pessimist when men	355.36802372023783
were in question. “They will promise everything for the sake of the	281.7317765949548
money, and on the road fear will prevent them from acting. Once taken,	248.95020546024023
they will be pressed; when pressed, they will confess everything. What	230.47241985514125
the devil! we are not children. To reach England”—Athos lowered his	171.5429267020997
voice—“all France, covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal,	247.8918149876154
must be crossed. A passport for embarkation must be obtained; and the	285.4363743183949
party must be acquainted with English in order to ask the way to	278.8740368498859
London. Really, I think the thing very difficult.”	206.2518350948769
“Not at all,” cried D’Artagnan, who was anxious the matter should be	201.16203077452772
accomplished; “on the contrary, I think it very easy. It would be, no	167.03648178953722
doubt, _parbleu_, if we write to Lord de Winter about affairs of vast	214.83652786447786
importance, of the horrors of the cardinal—”	356.56746728233276
“Speak lower!” said Athos.	259.25830420901025
“—of intrigues and secrets of state,” continued D’Artagnan, complying	197.22228748809516
with the recommendation. “There can be no doubt we would all be broken	317.5219576911535
on the wheel; but for God’s sake, do not forget, as you yourself said,	311.5136276914898
Athos, that we only write to him concerning a family affair; that we	323.54674495453264
only write to him to entreat that as soon as Milady arrives in London	277.1658062915685
he will put it out of her power to injure us. I will write to him,	360.33352729971574
then, nearly in these terms.”	290.19215141933586
“Let us see,” said Athos, assuming in advance a critical look.	205.493730360281
“_Monsieur and dear friend_—”	359.2752469487365
“Ah, yes! _Dear friend_ to an Englishman,” interrupted Athos; “well	360.42299947944343
commenced! Bravo, D’Artagnan! Only with that word you would be	199.35638070065085
quartered instead of being broken on the wheel.”	256.39033980881
“Well, perhaps. I will say, then, _Monsieur_, quite short.”	352.68116899556924
“You may even say, _My Lord_,” replied Athos, who stickled for	232.79268742778657
propriety.	330.0084780615314
“_My Lord, do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg?_”	201.84562443297997
“Good, _the Luxembourg!_ One might believe this is an allusion to the	207.50395035963777
queen-mother! That’s ingenious,” said Athos.	193.1214629053333
“Well, then, we will put simply, _My Lord, do you remember a certain	204.1613484877185
little enclosure where your life was spared?_”	312.39022200708257
“My dear D’Artagnan, you will never make anything but a very bad	230.74419084534793
secretary. _Where your life was spared!_ For shame! that’s unworthy. A	360.0667865345264
man of spirit is not to be reminded of such services. A benefit	264.41171261696155
reproached is an offense committed.”	332.2449176478017
“The devil!” said D’Artagnan, “you are insupportable. If the letter	220.8996394726938
must be written under your censure, my faith, I renounce the task.”	192.32933351093544
“And you will do right. Handle the musket and the sword, my dear	363.7812431846385
fellow. You will come off splendidly at those two exercises; but pass	275.07747887989495
the pen over to Monsieur Abbé. That’s his province.”	166.19050988057305
“Ay, ay!” said Porthos; “pass the pen to Aramis, who writes theses in	290.0737410766733
Latin.”	305.96788761833125
“Well, so be it,” said D’Artagnan. “Draw up this note for us, Aramis;	241.75803540890388
but by our Holy Father the Pope, cut it short, for I shall prune you in	338.46668626821895
my turn, I warn you.”	350.9708713726283
“I ask no better,” said Aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence	209.5036659216583
which every poet has in himself; “but let me be properly acquainted	170.83344032077468
with the subject. I have heard here and there that this sister-in-law	322.7348317663271
was a hussy. I have obtained proof of it by listening to her	258.5729724447374
conversation with the cardinal.”	294.756189595186
“Lower! _sacré bleu!_” said Athos.	332.95052586328745
“But,” continued Aramis, “the details escape me.”	233.9954564384617
“And me also,” said Porthos.	190.32492134452218
D’Artagnan and Athos looked at each other for some time in silence. At	276.6392192855835
length Athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than	316.6847985285292
usual, made a sign of assent to D’Artagnan, who by it understood he was	337.55992714938094
at liberty to speak.	234.61093190818303
“Well, this is what you have to say,” said D’Artagnan: “_My Lord, your	282.7342329123336
sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that	350.28307083754714
she might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your brother,	251.67531959642724
being already married in France, and having been_—” D’Artagnan stopped,	167.01200209254964
as if seeking for the word, and looked at Athos.	299.1571117862393
“Repudiated by her husband,” said Athos.	174.86165653190923
“Because she had been branded,” continued D’Artagnan.	264.2993161367932
“Bah!” cried Porthos. “Impossible! What do you say—that she wanted to	189.70000400196338
have her brother-in-law killed?”	338.07825955805345
“Yes.”	171.9756258621755
“She was married?” asked Aramis.	216.33387395507623
“Yes.”	181.29075626209672
“And her husband found out that she had a _fleur-de-lis_ on her	252.7785676043868
shoulder?” cried Porthos.	218.09774568411578
“Yes.”	199.46635150073288
These three _yeses_ had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder	184.09724533851568
intonation.	192.93941510576522
“And who has seen this _fleur-de-lis?_” inquired Aramis.	243.46834994490655
“D’Artagnan and I. Or rather, to observe the chronological order, I and	362.02251145391324
D’Artagnan,” replied Athos.	201.35846124605175
“And does the husband of this frightful creature still live?” said	223.27989515171186
Aramis.	280.14761082061614
“He still lives.”	222.6283658374622
“Are you quite sure of it?”	328.36225608534824
“I am he.”	218.33372322701672
There was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected	363.48581290664094
according to his nature.	346.9031710652478
“This time,” said Athos, first breaking the silence, “D’Artagnan has	271.7565198520742
given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.”	254.59484098970455
“The devil! You are right, Athos,” said Aramis; “and it is a rather	284.49396871404366
difficult matter. The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write	290.89225151358744
such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very	331.8006785295422
readily. Never mind! Be silent, I will write.”	363.93048693057233
Aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote	261.39922106256074
eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a	211.10743662768425
voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he	167.0085551922193
read the following:	355.44873448738974
“My Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of	252.16722256079416
crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue d’Enfer. As	174.22888334404342
you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that	220.72739182907173
person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending	230.57221932934834
you important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a	246.34513984230867
near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are	208.42046719381412
ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was	300.3728897945454
already married in France. But the third time, which is the present,	291.8788998676192
you may succumb. Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the	265.3603659253538
night. Watch her arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. If	245.48059655588477
you require to know positively what she is capable of, read her past	188.61218870365144
history on her left shoulder.”	289.9271868329946
“Well, now that will do wonderfully well,” said Athos. “My dear Aramis,	344.5975789675699
you have the pen of a secretary of state. Lord de Winter will now be	225.8551455205016
upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should	291.67596559697245
fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. But	291.0372165286674
as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and	211.8786942264212
may stop at Châtellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised	308.28349576831016
him, with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other	212.20630268022074
half in exchange for the reply. Have you the diamond?” continued Athos.	311.36223558555866
“I have what is still better. I have the price;” and D’Artagnan threw	183.09404284697234
the bag upon the table. At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes	351.51437091365125
and Porthos started. As to Athos, he remained unmoved.	189.63780207816274
“How much in that little bag?”	184.96757196229754
“Seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs.”	207.12843231332224
“Seven thousand livres!” cried Porthos. “That poor little diamond was	313.37549592433055
worth seven thousand livres?”	255.780668203615
“It appears so,” said Athos, “since here they are. I don’t suppose that	170.99051728047593
our friend D’Artagnan has added any of his own to the amount.”	195.34160806701794
“But, gentlemen, in all this,” said D’Artagnan, “we do not think of the	329.7507823419026
queen. Let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear Buckingham.	317.58189057658745
That is the least we owe her.”	305.16299636256554
“That’s true,” said Athos; “but that concerns Aramis.”	220.42670385465794
“Well,” replied the latter, blushing, “what must I say?”	231.61331078864274
“Oh, that’s simple enough!” replied Athos. “Write a second letter for	254.88339284538716
that clever personage who lives at Tours.”	351.75464404588035
Aramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following	222.22160105934847
lines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his	288.8739001402381
friends.	191.09028141536524
“_My dear cousin_.”	309.929201995473
“Ah, ah!” said Athos. “This clever person is your relative, then?”	287.9239108634118
“Cousin-german.”	193.430979033951
“Go on, to your cousin, then!”	249.60512579674673
Aramis continued:	293.79664219439036
“MY DEAR COUSIN, His Eminence, the cardinal, whom God preserve for the	291.1884542365132
happiness of France and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is	364.6415534755225
on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of La Rochelle.	262.6289895650389
It is probable that the succor of the English fleet will never even	273.180304908588
arrive in sight of the place. I will even venture to say that I am	299.85125883441526
certain M. de Buckingham will be prevented from setting out by some	244.3896880669667
great event. His Eminence is the most illustrious politician of times	189.02533352059388
past, of times present, and probably of times to come. He would	364.11418586440374
extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him. Give these happy tidings	193.35591102680695
to your sister, my dear cousin. I have dreamed that the unlucky	203.3031053214046
Englishman was dead. I cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by	304.00766526630605
poison; only of this I am sure, I have dreamed he was dead, and you	292.5389641677972
know my dreams never deceive me. Be assured, then, of seeing me soon	271.18001160959267
return.”	198.90150332848987
“Capital!” cried Athos; “you are the king of poets, my dear Aramis. You	223.83880353498833
speak like the Apocalypse, and you are as true as the Gospel. There is	264.1901053274052
nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter.”	251.92045515993686
“That is easily done,” said Aramis.	185.6124675186549
He folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:	312.63263786843197
“_To Mlle. Michon, seamstress, Tours_.”	215.0681401395899
The three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.	305.67126253815997
“Now,” said Aramis, “you will please to understand, gentlemen, that	324.0663974988174
Bazin alone can carry this letter to Tours. My cousin knows nobody but	362.2424751294957
Bazin, and places confidence in nobody but him; any other person would	240.1840795590674
fail. Besides, Bazin is ambitious and learned; Bazin has read history,	332.61421287742456
gentlemen, he knows that Sixtus the Fifth became Pope after having kept	316.21433990552407
pigs. Well, as he means to enter the Church at the same time as myself,	349.1474468958774
he does not despair of becoming Pope in his turn, or at least a	227.1588495458427
cardinal. You can understand that a man who has such views will never	245.74014260054977
allow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather	323.34880703415615
than speak.”	356.9018667940722
“Very well,” said D’Artagnan, “I consent to Bazin with all my heart,	170.9855242564303
but grant me Planchet. Milady had him one day turned out of doors, with	253.72011604771672
sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. Now, Planchet	229.6992243201293
has an excellent memory; and I will be bound that sooner than	292.1412875003604
relinquish any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be	208.46867170724764
beaten to death. If your arrangements at Tours are your arrangements,	173.6097617067767
Aramis, those of London are mine. I request, then, that Planchet may be	194.4801685887276
chosen, more particularly as he has already been to London with me, and	209.1174879530189
knows how to speak correctly: _London, sir, if you please, and my	312.36806683190514
master, Lord D’Artagnan_. With that you may be satisfied he can make	363.2965029885157
his way, both going and returning.”	198.5849380753696
“In that case,” said Athos, “Planchet must receive seven hundred livres	345.1526765156136
for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and Bazin, three	335.7825469636607
hundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning—that	183.5778878073064
will reduce the sum to five thousand livres. We will each take a	215.3875812746855
thousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund	229.3107172638447
of a thousand livres under the guardianship of Monsieur Abbé here, for	230.35904290689325
extraordinary occasions or common wants. Will that do?”	225.49012695452586
“My dear Athos,” said Aramis, “you speak like Nestor, who was, as	337.7917185470126
everyone knows, the wisest among the Greeks.”	170.16143342947692
“Well, then,” said Athos, “it is agreed. Planchet and Bazin shall go.	222.06498326120493
Everything considered, I am not sorry to retain Grimaud; he is	314.0967215596071
accustomed to my ways, and I am particular. Yesterday’s affair must	281.90888145951584
have shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite.”	344.81576563411613
Planchet was sent for, and instructions were given him. The matter had	228.90521537793865
been named to him by D’Artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the	198.14912058254066
money to him, then the glory, and then the danger.	235.350174027104
“I will carry the letter in the lining of my coat,” said Planchet; “and	360.9799653005449
if I am taken I will swallow it.”	219.52981531689937
“Well, but then you will not be able to fulfill your commission,” said	285.2722134783502
D’Artagnan.	237.48747719330345
“You will give me a copy this evening, which I shall know by heart	180.86727654623127
tomorrow.”	248.75342306036657
D’Artagnan looked at his friends, as if to say, “Well, what did I tell	364.0239856785646
you?”	189.0809597161847
“Now,” continued he, addressing Planchet, “you have eight days to get	313.4069104486879
an interview with Lord de Winter; you have eight days to return—in all	351.5716685909403
sixteen days. If, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight	243.36216361737996
o’clock in the evening you are not here, no money—even if it be but	285.7794372485495
five minutes past eight.”	195.0702981854811
“Then, monsieur,” said Planchet, “you must buy me a watch.”	208.28822268388805
“Take this,” said Athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him	337.4644604478457
his own, “and be a good lad. Remember, if you talk, if you babble, if	186.25987554469256
you get drunk, you risk your master’s head, who has so much confidence	342.46971714026984
in your fidelity, and who answers for you. But remember, also, that if	362.2976906142095
by your fault any evil happens to D’Artagnan, I will find you, wherever	301.60349333417446
you may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly.”	330.67811843995867
“Oh, monsieur!” said Planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and	266.14241364897924
moreover, terrified at the calm air of the Musketeer.	216.74833899059138
“And I,” said Porthos, rolling his large eyes, “remember, I will skin	354.3626309645939
you alive.”	245.4141757012495
“Ah, monsieur!”	310.41684001916104
“And I,” said Aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, “remember that I	329.11223370525204
will roast you at a slow fire, like a savage.”	315.01766259877405
“Ah, monsieur!”	230.95252921753286
Planchet began to weep. We will not venture to say whether it was from	288.8504507777823
terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends	202.03879089598638
so closely united.	218.43544311959087
D’Artagnan took his hand. “See, Planchet,” said he, “these gentlemen	279.95562605083217
only say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like	351.5126434226448
you.”	237.62564324396354
“Ah, monsieur,” said Planchet, “I will succeed or I will consent to be	316.57321061977865
cut in quarters; and if they do cut me in quarters, be assured that not	294.62824536867333
a morsel of me will speak.”	258.5972487745236
It was decided that Planchet should set out the next day, at eight	175.9737311457599
o’clock in the morning, in order, as he had said, that he might during	190.52822217188864
the night learn the letter by heart. He gained just twelve hours by	190.7336435492698
this engagement; he was to be back on the sixteenth day, by eight	287.0108091728888
o’clock in the evening.	313.7412835893373
In the morning, as he was mounting his horse, D’Artagnan, who felt at	205.32524477754896
the bottom of his heart a partiality for the duke, took Planchet aside.	329.58574104968267
“Listen,” said he to him. “When you have given the letter to Lord de	194.363165191624
Winter and he has read it, you will further say to him: _Watch over his	329.0759088958639
Grace Lord Buckingham, for they wish to assassinate him_. But this,	264.48412854097427
Planchet, is so serious and important that I have not informed my	252.63673819420904
friends that I would entrust this secret to you; and for a captain’s	254.9125254172693
commission I would not write it.”	330.50591013208157
“Be satisfied, monsieur,” said Planchet, “you shall see if confidence	313.1028577899548
can be placed in me.”	198.09999843707004
Mounted on an excellent horse, which he was to leave at the end of	296.43570189029026
twenty leagues in order to take the post, Planchet set off at a gallop,	306.0792045846283
his spirits a little depressed by the triple promise made him by the	202.68890894285312
Musketeers, but otherwise as light-hearted as possible.	307.2094992891925
Bazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for	290.3962212660667
performing his commission.	343.25374856224926
The four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may	176.32569481384473
well be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the	218.4122883539181
ear on the hark. Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all	360.0348034345652
that was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in	203.42963025193347
looking out for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an	266.9598296283681
involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected	243.6969742117846
service. They had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper	267.6608899308334
safety; Milady was a phantom which, when it had once appeared to	259.0479598994634
people, did not allow them to sleep very quietly.	299.07286893027594
On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling,	270.08459132478436
according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four	299.4852683185245
friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed	212.08118925625809
upon: “Monsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.”	334.7625012923145
The four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done.	266.35810187151725
It is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part.	171.68985476617127
Aramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a	299.0390929238331
large, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography.	175.0236431677465
“Good God!” cried he, laughing, “I quite despair of my poor Michon; she	266.3875832428846
will never write like Monsieur de Voiture.”	182.22084001774678
“What does you mean by boor Michon?” said the Swiss, who was chatting	279.1224591905683
with the four friends when the letter came.	275.7822655118151
“Oh, _pardieu_, less than nothing,” said Aramis; “a charming little	288.82221754361035
seamstress, whom I love dearly and from whose hand I requested a few	256.19998396151055
lines as a sort of keepsake.”	204.13990716719272
“The duvil!” said the Swiss, “if she is as great a lady as her writing	222.92640769785498
is large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!”	336.83387410184764
Aramis read the letter, and passed it to Athos.	273.95444690489074
“See what she writes to me, Athos,” said he.	285.5358968850242
Athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the	311.5857612660634
suspicions that might have been created, read aloud:	261.18653332087547
“MY COUSIN, My sister and I are skillful in interpreting dreams, and	324.67917535904155
even entertain great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, I hope,	208.02985411509854
every dream is an illusion. Adieu! Take care of yourself, and act so	303.81861770186026
that we may from time to time hear you spoken of.	310.889997156802
“MARIE MICHON”	170.9561288583007
“And what dream does she mean?” asked the dragoon, who had approached	207.04824164796887
during the reading.	290.82729370489307
“Yez; what’s the dream?” said the Swiss.	240.95264159873696
“Well, _pardieu!_” said Aramis, “it was only this: I had a dream, and I	203.1608601864076
related it to her.”	315.308980649286
“Yez, yez,” said the Swiss; “it’s simple enough to dell a dream, but I	256.7639419726565
neffer dream.”	227.1896683588027
“You are very fortunate,” said Athos, rising; “I wish I could say as	344.4508545683866
much!”	184.02882630541177
“Neffer,” replied the Swiss, enchanted that a man like Athos could envy	329.1436664661925
him anything. “Neffer, neffer!”	358.5875524425718
D’Artagnan, seeing Athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went	291.9458732836198
out.	192.23624097713022
Porthos and Aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the	232.1828893661234
dragoon and the Swiss.	323.68422577671447
As to Bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had	183.61050740507827
more imagination than the Swiss, he dreamed that Aramis, having become	335.0500824075513
pope, adorned his head with a cardinal’s hat.	248.74303515261425
But, as we have said, Bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed	249.9204137239164
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.	325.72507679723327
The days of expectation are long, and D’Artagnan, in particular, would	287.0078118000579
have wagered that the days were forty-four hours. He forgot the	336.5035718818308
necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power	190.46239235986855
of Milady. He credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a	348.4521336363282
demon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he	338.11074391322825
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that Planchet was being	238.69348980729518
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. Still	190.514415659266
further, his confidence in the worthy Picard, at one time so great,	329.74358831631463
diminished day by day. This anxiety became so great that it even	207.42217711873556
extended to Aramis and Porthos. Athos alone remained unmoved, as if no	215.01000154257494
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary	305.55255304244963
atmosphere.	190.3751757889314
On the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in	232.38519934893685
D’Artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one	333.6667615806907
place, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which Planchet was	356.31881507954165
expected.	358.50259239916613
“Really,” said Athos to them, “you are not men but children, to let a	204.4506598112505
woman terrify you so! And what does it amount to, after all? To be	270.57712083194406
imprisoned. Well, but we should be taken out of prison; Madame	332.28440446185334
Bonacieux was released. To be decapitated? Why, every day in the	273.73983532507543
trenches we go cheerfully to expose ourselves to worse than that—for a	349.68186819753134
bullet may break a leg, and I am convinced a surgeon would give us more	245.54573349739826
pain in cutting off a thigh than an executioner in cutting off a head.	210.57832085960766
Wait quietly, then; in two hours, in four, in six hours at latest,	204.74548423094694
Planchet will be here. He promised to be here, and I have very great	308.13583609631246
faith in Planchet, who appears to me to be a very good lad.”	279.1759195146607
“But if he does not come?” said D’Artagnan.	334.67376273919257
“Well, if he does not come, it will be because he has been delayed,	345.3081165277147
that’s all. He may have fallen from his horse, he may have cut a caper	291.76178269137245
from the deck; he may have traveled so fast against the wind as to have	303.7477655741851
brought on a violent catarrh. Eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon	319.6930830577886
accidents! Life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher	328.8518534079393
counts with a smile. Be philosophers, as I am, gentlemen; sit down at	248.40157288548426
the table and let us drink. Nothing makes the future look so bright as	322.76102918446077
surveying it through a glass of chambertin.”	260.95346500506736
“That’s all very well,” replied D’Artagnan; “but I am tired of fearing	297.5615195345207
when I open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of	302.86166539679607
Milady.”	233.99931080497987
“You are very fastidious,” said Athos; “such a beautiful woman!”	258.309887843788
“A woman of mark!” said Porthos, with his loud laugh.	320.6872243013206
Athos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of	300.1906831172022
perspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous	171.66453335514748
movement he could not repress.	255.83051509213018
The day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but	184.29801277026877
finally it came. The bars were filled with drinkers. Athos, who had	183.0403436641485
pocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the Parpaillot. He had	226.69764772976768
found in M. de Busigny, who, by the by, had given them a magnificent	172.66685221214743
dinner, a partner worthy of his company. They were playing together, as	184.14852372741103
usual, when seven o’clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to	260.9226813232028
double the posts. At half past seven the retreat was sounded.	253.234838668181
“We are lost,” said D’Artagnan, in the ear of Athos.	314.3467844081515
“You mean to say we _have lost_,” said Athos, quietly, drawing four	324.32921462432944
pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. “Come,	340.2332173330897
gentlemen,” said he, “they are beating the tattoo. Let us to bed!”	217.42566707720806
And Athos went out of the Parpaillot, followed by D’Artagnan. Aramis	290.6138624622939
came behind, giving his arm to Porthos. Aramis mumbled verses to	263.8989075370693
himself, and Porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his	240.00904498677653
mustache, in sign of despair.	307.2850975428839
But all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which	230.26543695795831
was familiar to D’Artagnan, and a well-known voice said, “Monsieur, I	338.24221715136446
have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening.”	344.35509687696253
“Planchet!” cried D’Artagnan, beside himself with joy.	263.1977261916138
“Planchet!” repeated Aramis and Porthos.	351.63232422639896
“Well, yes, Planchet, to be sure,” said Athos, “what is there so	240.53178896109497
astonishing in that? He promised to be back by eight o’clock, and eight	285.1360632740167
is striking. Bravo, Planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever	288.16716402503874
you leave your master, I will promise you a place in my service.”	246.7581421730494
“Oh, no, never,” said Planchet, “I will never leave Monsieur	203.36518360162125
d’Artagnan.”	292.1241306612133
At the same time D’Artagnan felt that Planchet slipped a note into his	243.76184935094096
hand.	229.5697396286019
D’Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had	221.74867396859315
embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of	357.15620344843273
affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear	248.45290227265463
extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.	294.540337647579
“I have the note,” said he to Athos and to his friends.	172.70011220294543
“That’s well,” said Athos, “let us go home and read it.”	330.5696553291013
The note burned the hand of D’Artagnan. He wished to hasten their	343.73054067159717
steps; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the	226.80417312955288
young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend.	318.17124256412967
At length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood	174.76506723871046
at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised,	241.29566311548209
D’Artagnan, with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so	318.8216264713545
anxiously expected letter.	204.77718349211614
It contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a	327.77067037167654
conciseness as perfectly Spartan:	214.78064662835448
_Thank you; be easy_.	340.67248844424574
D’Artagnan translated this for the others.	284.9921689015197
Athos took the letter from the hands of D’Artagnan, approached the	310.0875509350343
lamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to	248.77892136670602
a cinder.	297.86589676620645
Then, calling Planchet, he said, “Now, my lad, you may claim your seven	225.77301080783917
hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as	290.6794833236671
that.”	212.45151785903147
“I am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it,” said	311.649115840635
Planchet.	193.82723213020492
“Well!” cried D’Artagnan, “tell us all about it.”	176.69818922507812
“_Dame_, that’s a long job, monsieur.”	365.5282041494095
“You are right, Planchet,” said Athos; “besides, the tattoo has been	252.55517500181702
sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much	348.9769577841694
longer than the others.”	262.360969099899
“So be it,” said D’Artagnan. “Go to bed, Planchet, and sleep soundly.”	282.6429645276101
“My faith, monsieur! that will be the first time I have done so for	341.5576484423823
sixteen days.”	177.51341188520433
“And me, too!” said D’Artagnan.	327.1103511643528
“And me, too!” said Porthos.	194.97404094107702
“And me, too!” said Aramis.	342.1042022425757
“Well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!” said Athos.	231.99758245058172
Chapter XLIX.	263.9584064341794
FATALITY	359.9733959505434
Meantime Milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness	297.95572927745104
that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea	328.1365170915111
that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the	321.88511046707913
thought that she had been insulted by D’Artagnan, threatened by Athos,	351.6803696103748
and that she had quit France without being revenged on them. This idea	309.4287055833594
soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever	192.0392482725643
terrible consequences might result to herself from it, she implored the	173.47437292266426
captain to put her on shore; but the captain, eager to escape from his	316.0645366974221
false position—placed between French and English cruisers, like the bat	211.4934055513541
between the mice and the birds—was in great haste to regain England,	270.38662540157196
and positively refused to obey what he took for a woman’s caprice,	244.9426582677674
promising his passenger, who had been particularly recommended to him	280.11318008398325
by the cardinal, to land her, if the sea and the French permitted him,	276.19529422016694
at one of the ports of Brittany, either at Lorient or Brest. But the	206.9215928639755
wind was contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore. Nine	317.7175389254267
days after leaving the Charente, pale with fatigue and vexation, Milady	362.9804424258758
saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear.	342.2690969834463
She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the	243.5398207265481
cardinal it would take her at least three days. Add another day for	257.94667428928267
landing, and that would make four. Add these four to the nine others,	191.90373314672297
that would be thirteen days lost—thirteen days, during which so many	182.94984528715187
important events might pass in London. She reflected likewise that the	362.4467447736133
cardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more	234.807473009893
disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the	338.3201244913814
accusations she brought against others.	324.98473393426434
She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her	334.4081864316322
request to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her	201.52614381027234
of it. Milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day that	353.84953070694587
Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France, the messenger of his	227.99150757352893
Eminence entered the port in triumph.	234.81540323830933
All the city was agitated by an extraordinary movement. Four large	235.17598206690386
vessels, recently built, had just been launched. At the end of the	176.7674457561368
jetty, his clothes richly laced with gold, glittering, as was customary	224.76520732959193
with him, with diamonds and precious stones, his hat ornamented with a	212.1246343531053
white feather which drooped upon his shoulder, Buckingham was seen	259.03188216958813
surrounded by a staff almost as brilliant as himself.	329.5256228315952
It was one of those rare and beautiful days in winter when England	248.4084326835334
remembers that there is a sun. The star of day, pale but nevertheless	345.6459658741953
still splendid, was setting in the horizon, glorifying at once the	275.38127490210627
heavens and the sea with bands of fire, and casting upon the towers and	245.95574691040792
the old houses of the city a last ray of gold which made the windows	271.2348026397344
sparkle like the reflection of a conflagration. Breathing that sea	168.71613088983455
breeze, so much more invigorating and balsamic as the land is	213.33681607315108
approached, contemplating all the power of those preparations she was	192.31989776221437
commissioned to destroy, all the power of that army which she was to	318.64133383867147
combat alone—she, a woman with a few bags of gold—Milady compared	365.6094206164563
herself mentally to Judith, the terrible Jewess, when she penetrated	184.6350900745247
the camp of the Assyrians and beheld the enormous mass of chariots,	365.6216132418513
horses, men, and arms, which a gesture of her hand was to dissipate	271.1145130954738
like a cloud of smoke.	338.252238939221
They entered the roadstead; but as they drew near in order to cast	174.03475090570777
anchor, a little cutter, looking like a coastguard formidably armed,	217.7164909417432
approached the merchant vessel and dropped into the sea a boat which	333.6926385048352
directed its course to the ladder. This boat contained an officer, a	183.83336470343747
mate, and eight rowers. The officer alone went on board, where he was	265.05669243663965
received with all the deference inspired by the uniform.	248.14034898197622
The officer conversed a few instants with the captain, gave him several	311.71450651116265
papers, of which he was the bearer, to read, and upon the order of the	221.45470395551155
merchant captain the whole crew of the vessel, both passengers and	313.8741795293691
sailors, were called upon deck.	331.67968203699616
When this species of summons was made the officer inquired aloud the	351.89120070846707
point of the brig’s departure, its route, its landings; and to all	327.4087462876124
these questions the captain replied without difficulty and without	215.65380790214195
hesitation. Then the officer began to pass in review all the people,	190.45163636277397
one after the other, and stopping when he came to Milady, surveyed her	209.19123677255237
very closely, but without addressing a single word to her.	278.67695998868146
He then returned to the captain, said a few words to him, and as if	181.81935443880153
from that moment the vessel was under his command, he ordered a	351.3024804280436
maneuver which the crew executed immediately. Then the vessel resumed	344.3058091023148
its course, still escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by	278.07876532231614
side with it, menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon. The boat	267.41181462568744
followed in the wake of the ship, a speck near the enormous mass.	314.0652402538901
During the examination of Milady by the officer, as may well be	252.4384268436068
imagined, Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances.	356.324531215502
But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in	175.89329919519136
reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine, she met	268.2981523214238
this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery	263.78083785219553
followed her investigation. The officer who had stopped in front of her	234.4157457272757
and studied her with so much care might have been twenty-five or	181.28525679367485
twenty-six years of age. He was of pale complexion, with clear blue	360.3635508891973
eyes, rather deeply set; his mouth, fine and well cut, remained	190.13918847294016
motionless in its correct lines; his chin, strongly marked, denoted	245.91682274550442
that strength of will which in the ordinary Britannic type denotes	250.26473547459733
mostly nothing but obstinacy; a brow a little receding, as is proper	276.0897590799207
for poets, enthusiasts, and soldiers, was scarcely shaded by short thin	247.2703664776389
hair which, like the beard which covered the lower part of his face,	254.5297723219706
was of a beautiful deep chestnut color.	197.33811596191524
When they entered the port, it was already night. The fog increased the	338.06363598873935
darkness, and formed round the sternlights and lanterns of the jetty a	345.07619087416236
circle like that which surrounds the moon when the weather threatens to	216.7980169421579
become rainy. The air they breathed was heavy, damp, and cold.	327.2992712400673
Milady, that woman so courageous and firm, shivered in spite of	166.91524152250778
herself.	266.00641831346627
The officer desired to have Milady’s packages pointed out to him, and	243.4935118438242
ordered them to be placed in the boat. When this operation was	186.14276482730895
complete, he invited her to descend by offering her his hand.	209.95487321745543
Milady looked at this man, and hesitated. “Who are you, sir,” asked	334.9157122590989
she, “who has the kindness to trouble yourself so particularly on my	187.67453816979122
account?”	234.24787686110267
“You may perceive, madame, by my uniform, that I am an officer in the	194.5870323777412
English navy,” replied the young man.	267.7349403589688
“But is it the custom for the officers in the English navy to place	352.968805471606
themselves at the service of their female compatriots when they land in	168.62298928120865
a port of Great Britain, and carry their gallantry so far as to conduct	267.3554024896272
them ashore?”	245.34209765445135
“Yes, madame, it is the custom, not from gallantry but prudence, that	318.25432930989086
in time of war foreigners should be conducted to particular hôtels, in	308.3580185734386
order that they may remain under the eye of the government until full	222.31423346483444
information can be obtained about them.”	345.1186868610431
These words were pronounced with the most exact politeness and the most	296.64672318025396
perfect calmness. Nevertheless, they had not the power of convincing	357.76594049921164
Milady.	300.40937097502484
“But I am not a foreigner, sir,” said she, with an accent as pure as	194.26111887799442
ever was heard between Portsmouth and Manchester; “my name is Lady	174.3734394767501
Clarik, and this measure—”	168.91367675162797
“This measure is general, madame; and you will seek in vain to evade	279.6986030284588
it.”	274.0669508837925
“I will follow you, then, sir.”	221.3234126075868
Accepting the hand of the officer, she began the descent of the ladder,	179.15620932469392
at the foot of which the boat waited. The officer followed her. A large	356.7564333516966
cloak was spread at the stern; the officer requested her to sit down	303.2267077110761
upon this cloak, and placed himself beside her.	275.80476488646997
“Row!” said he to the sailors.	240.6048853614267
The eight oars fell at once into the sea, making but a single sound,	239.77297978499686
giving but a single stroke, and the boat seemed to fly over the surface	342.81139065096363
of the water.	280.7704829897465
In five minutes they gained the land.	203.12967261324505
The officer leaped to the pier, and offered his hand to Milady. A	215.17657108157545
carriage was in waiting.	337.92153953405835
“Is this carriage for us?” asked Milady.	274.8931060041908
“Yes, madame,” replied the officer.	203.71977113045142
“The hôtel, then, is far away?”	294.2419011727544
“At the other end of the town.”	288.62776334804425
“Very well,” said Milady; and she resolutely entered the carriage.	295.6869040652055
The officer saw that the baggage was fastened carefully behind the	210.71089350601824
carriage; and this operation ended, he took his place beside Milady,	222.1117648177243
and shut the door.	242.99844604396932
Immediately, without any order being given or his place of destination	230.65934838636485
indicated, the coachman set off at a rapid pace, and plunged into the	332.04699973458764
streets of the city.	182.19111211937
So strange a reception naturally gave Milady ample matter for	244.00970122113876
reflection; so seeing that the young officer did not seem at all	279.15376987548444
disposed for conversation, she reclined in her corner of the carriage,	251.82563102956846
and one after the other passed in review all the surmises which	318.03897023544346
presented themselves to her mind.	356.49975450170075
At the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of	226.58980119581776
the journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was	235.0689517866827
being conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in	178.74341608452767
the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady	179.1674133426245
shuddered.	243.42231948624823
“But we are no longer in the city, sir,” said she.	286.5939079549157
The young officer preserved silence.	273.0419083234555
“I beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me	365.0643519987658
whither you are taking me.”	361.3147229293057
This threat brought no reply.	203.45092025000977
“Oh, this is too much,” cried Milady. “Help! help!”	342.7053705558744
No voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with	296.45051824915936
rapidity; the officer seemed a statue.	311.2270075156222
Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions	344.0973836092883
peculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their	185.22812960864223
effect; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness.	172.5904024530079
The young man remained immovable.	191.89476468389492
Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out.	237.0478468766545
“Take care, madame,” said the young man, coolly, “you will kill	340.3132424454251
yourself in jumping.”	184.08408964854397
Milady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at	363.0381716749462
her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before	251.0189326515383
so beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful	305.3041432050634
creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing	205.6333090059125
him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a	259.38056696064734
complaining voice said: “In the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is	170.54238599729874
to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to	252.60166206448702
attribute the violence that is done me?”	255.0530126114108
“No violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is	166.2075144640991
the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with	191.94731673037387
all who land in England.”	271.5210787269444
“Then you don’t know me, sir?”	345.0090188933107
“It is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.”	284.0086645638961
“And on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?”	317.22637117141244
“None, I swear to you.”	296.2003456487947
There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of	239.89826485438613
the young man, that Milady felt reassured.	178.41080080662567
At length after a journey of nearly an hour, the carriage stopped	204.70567000949805
before an iron gate, which closed an avenue leading to a castle severe	280.06364284359194
in form, massive, and isolated. Then, as the wheels rolled over a fine	313.99534177111275
gravel, Milady could hear a vast roaring, which she at once recognized	239.1086733006319
as the noise of the sea dashing against some steep cliff.	343.6336871129711
The carriage passed under two arched gateways, and at length stopped in	272.0326946134283
a court large, dark, and square. Almost immediately the door of the	288.09548423174874
carriage was opened, the young man sprang lightly out and presented his	212.37223697689495
hand to Milady, who leaned upon it, and in her turn alighted with	254.87788268705458
tolerable calmness.	176.27853571746175
“Still, then, I am a prisoner,” said Milady, looking around her, and	336.51658850892306
bringing back her eyes with a most gracious smile to the young officer;	209.92929438754717
“but I feel assured it will not be for long,” added she. “My own	223.0531764706706
conscience and your politeness, sir, are the guarantees of that.”	329.16804468779856
However flattering this compliment, the officer made no reply; but	261.92653703272816
drawing from his belt a little silver whistle, such as boatswains use	308.3458067762428
in ships of war, he whistled three times, with three different	294.86377356821686
modulations. Immediately several men appeared, who unharnessed the	209.75007042666476
smoking horses, and put the carriage into a coach house.	340.06836286004534
Then the officer, with the same calm politeness, invited his prisoner	193.4999742403849
to enter the house. She, with a still-smiling countenance, took his	174.88466351907002
arm, and passed with him under a low arched door, which by a vaulted	175.11968458306114
passage, lighted only at the farther end, led to a stone staircase	188.1105908645298
around an angle of stone. They then came to a massive door, which after	292.63819406470014
the introduction into the lock of a key which the young man carried	211.02103691395394
with him, turned heavily upon its hinges, and disclosed the chamber	280.2553875306764
destined for Milady.	301.8411967543992
With a single glance the prisoner took in the apartment in its minutest	297.35326374018086
details. It was a chamber whose furniture was at once appropriate for a	364.3457921658544
prisoner or a free man; and yet bars at the windows and outside bolts	220.29231970774325
at the door decided the question in favor of the prison.	196.867109784388
In an instant all the strength of mind of this creature, though drawn	217.6352506138536
from the most vigorous sources, abandoned her; she sank into a large	339.10574786915095
easy chair, with her arms crossed, her head lowered, and expecting	219.74391940491003
every instant to see a judge enter to interrogate her.	312.6392690058772
But no one entered except two or three marines, who brought her trunks	346.74054655104123
and packages, deposited them in a corner, and retired without speaking.	307.83697186685674
The officer superintended all these details with the same calmness	339.82989786089064
Milady had constantly seen in him, never pronouncing a word himself,	265.35210585226883
and making himself obeyed by a gesture of his hand or a sound of his	192.70776633006636
whistle.	279.2813708321828
It might have been said that between this man and his inferiors spoken	169.7795869025446
language did not exist, or had become useless.	228.0633209219539
At length Milady could hold out no longer; she broke the silence. “In	305.94275526122834
the name of heaven, sir,” cried she, “what means all that is passing?	327.87892927004077
Put an end to my doubts; I have courage enough for any danger I can	353.09602791411675
foresee, for every misfortune which I understand. Where am I, and why	267.8191133810163
am I here? If I am free, why these bars and these doors? If I am a	174.09737905773707
prisoner, what crime have I committed?”	358.99698071408585
“You are here in the apartment destined for you, madame. I received	198.28765188134133
orders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you to	268.75024570821597
this castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the	205.6187846388733
exactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman.	259.2962473439027
There terminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to	317.8781796027775
fulfill toward you; the rest concerns another person.”	362.26869285171017
“And who is that other person?” asked Milady, warmly. “Can you not tell	206.02238625765926
me his name?”	177.0442605693841
At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some	320.1882418973998
voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep	183.37399781307744
approached the door.	300.93775835923606
“That person is here, madame,” said the officer, leaving the entrance	229.93371073328967
open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect.	184.6131089724219
At the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He	166.30180298044272
was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in	257.52126009208996
his hand.	304.5408162768846
Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported	314.66254996915484
herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head	288.3851826108188
as if to meet a certainty.	216.93108555967405
The stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into	281.86455436549073
the circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew	280.62537621498166
back.	364.6357217964404
Then when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor,	342.71332579879487
“What, my brother, is it you?”	334.60994224455067
“Yes, fair lady!” replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous,	309.46744901848683
half ironical; “it is I, myself.”	351.7993830837168
“But this castle, then?”	268.3329346150655
“Is mine.”	277.1622342680126
“This chamber?”	282.3534472177215
“Is yours.”	280.7999757810489
“I am, then, your prisoner?”	211.4572166855584
“Nearly so.”	349.78433776008205
“But this is a frightful abuse of power!”	315.7434343342925
“No high-sounding words! Let us sit down and chat quietly, as brother	252.36989961551546
and sister ought to do.”	179.09996767544365
Then, turning toward the door, and seeing that the young officer was	306.9140254503381
waiting for his last orders, he said. “All is well, I thank you; now	260.0935852018914
leave us alone, Mr. Felton.”	281.30727585603734
Chapter L.	306.66643839853396
CHAT BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER	253.68626676865767
During the time which Lord de Winter took to shut the door, close a	299.9554401419372
shutter, and draw a chair near to his sister-in-law’s _fauteuil_,	296.6610951830021
Milady, anxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of	186.97057917299296
possibility, and discovered all the plan, of which she could not even	282.18828483772535
obtain a glance as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had	177.36738922199987
fallen. She knew her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold	330.49068930277423
hunter, an intrepid player, enterprising with women, but by no means	181.4697615307275
remarkable for his skill in intrigues. How had he discovered her	219.05563165234042
arrival, and caused her to be seized? Why did he detain her?	208.36247564851627
Athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had	355.066397619144
with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not	311.6492252881485
suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. She	174.71839197228957
rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been	176.9853347069106
discovered. Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut	200.80095716410256
off the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery; but	188.6910163595102
Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman,	299.5553195255235
particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of	319.90051233354313
jealousy.	344.13941413340376
This supposition appeared to her most reasonable. It seemed to her that	322.0993167064512
they wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future. At	337.6199275504099
all events, she congratulated herself upon having fallen into the hands	300.66463683179
of her brother-in-law, with whom she reckoned she could deal very	353.14849953710655
easily, rather than into the hands of an acknowledged and intelligent	347.51230269474263
enemy.	307.33953767338517
“Yes, let us chat, brother,” said she, with a kind of cheerfulness,	233.97549446843433
decided as she was to draw from the conversation, in spite of all the	270.607113181508
dissimulation Lord de Winter could bring, the revelations of which she	176.6522228080111
stood in need to regulate her future conduct.	361.8812091250206
“You have, then, decided to come to England again,” said Lord de	288.68150729081265
Winter, “in spite of the resolutions you so often expressed in Paris	361.7505379193317
never to set your feet on British ground?”	167.2322792264876
Milady replied to this question by another question. “To begin with,	354.12647589391884
tell me,” said she, “how have you watched me so closely as to be aware	205.27463792710734
beforehand not only of my arrival, but even of the day, the hour, and	217.80481535264596
the port at which I should arrive?”	271.58071291153476
Lord de Winter adopted the same tactics as Milady, thinking that as his	189.202222738557
sister-in-law employed them they must be the best.	288.61080872005175
“But tell me, my dear sister,” replied he, “what makes you come to	293.73960274188835
England?”	313.4258196558644
“I come to see you,” replied Milady, without knowing how much she	178.27701101570466
aggravated by this reply the suspicions to which D’Artagnan’s letter	316.4412265361086
had given birth in the mind of her brother-in-law, and only desiring to	230.49831117054308
gain the good will of her auditor by a falsehood.	361.1582844822516
“Ah, to see me?” said de Winter, cunningly.	345.6698599358833
“To be sure, to see you. What is there astonishing in that?”	266.3256542106787
“And you had no other object in coming to England but to see me?”	182.79312259918885
“No.”	300.2180447501749
“So it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the	247.70902869458405
Channel?”	353.76022239534825
“For you alone.”	281.6046140160205
“The deuce! What tenderness, my sister!”	346.15917553189036
“But am I not your nearest relative?” demanded Milady, with a tone of	309.0158068626673
the most touching ingenuousness.	294.30446117301284
“And my only heir, are you not?” said Lord de Winter in his turn,	297.8424264145593
fixing his eyes on those of Milady.	227.52384765852037
Whatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting;	188.06910433386892
and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand	194.29297751627337
upon the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.	219.61804960833632
In fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred	297.8041519652047
to Milady’s mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she	251.38938147219488
had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which	234.67611467095398
she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant.	325.8127592756353
She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon	183.69586259236766
D’Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.	181.54091611397604
“I do not understand, my Lord,” said she, in order to gain time and	319.0549465195287
make her adversary speak out. “What do you mean to say? Is there any	284.364605209721
secret meaning concealed beneath your words?”	270.1190779821411
“Oh, my God, no!” said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature. “You	233.17743882791626
wish to see me, and you come to England. I learn this desire, or rather	263.67375098943756
I suspect that you feel it; and in order to spare you all the	306.4007895542653
annoyances of a nocturnal arrival in a port and all the fatigues of	261.37585959811673
landing, I send one of my officers to meet you, I place a carriage at	197.01985080175064
his orders, and he brings you hither to this castle, of which I am	236.3383804983397
governor, whither I come every day, and where, in order to satisfy our	202.58191890028874
mutual desire of seeing each other, I have prepared you a chamber. What	313.79076472581505
is there more astonishing in all that I have said to you than in what	273.7362896453856
you have told me?”	361.69809576451996
“No; what I think astonishing is that you should expect my coming.”	275.976069833656
“And yet that is the most simple thing in the world, my dear sister.	219.0824547643972
Have you not observed that the captain of your little vessel, on	258.11910250892834
entering the roadstead, sent forward, in order to obtain permission to	172.7214794897025
enter the port, a little boat bearing his logbook and the register of	299.8193546875127
his voyagers? I am commandant of the port. They brought me that book. I	290.69032481789407
recognized your name in it. My heart told me what your mouth has just	187.25451179230419
confirmed—that is to say, with what view you have exposed yourself to	171.99032243036223
the dangers of a sea so perilous, or at least so troublesome at this	205.8370364609666
moment—and I sent my cutter to meet you. You know the rest.”	224.51023290364805
Milady knew that Lord de Winter lied, and she was the more alarmed.	275.2828358390984
“My brother,” continued she, “was not that my Lord Buckingham whom I	235.00172924573363
saw on the jetty this evening as we arrived?”	207.51769621890563
“Himself. Ah, I can understand how the sight of him struck you,”	291.44561915361027
replied Lord de Winter. “You came from a country where he must be very	330.656829996817
much talked of, and I know that his armaments against France greatly	355.1998029990224
engage the attention of your friend the cardinal.”	208.1531272530184
“My friend the cardinal!” cried Milady, seeing that on this point as on	208.4228419423944
the other Lord de Winter seemed well instructed.	308.26649951380966
“Is he not your friend?” replied the baron, negligently. “Ah, pardon! I	269.496700512101
thought so; but we will return to my Lord Duke presently. Let us not	299.66327411713223
depart from the sentimental turn our conversation had taken. You came,	189.61123420102905
you say, to see me?”	285.68458108530535
“Yes.”	217.04397624842318
“Well, I reply that you shall be served to the height of your wishes,	250.07738648269668
and that we shall see each other every day.”	242.61335266430046
“Am I, then, to remain here eternally?” demanded Milady, with a certain	225.9787957432981
terror.	362.69417622299375
“Do you find yourself badly lodged, sister? Demand anything you want,	203.36293214812952
and I will hasten to have you furnished with it.”	345.6520483013089
“But I have neither my women nor my servants.”	238.48293752358896
“You shall have all, madame. Tell me on what footing your household was	254.87731887375674
established by your first husband, and although I am only your	197.43682745612955
brother-in-law, I will arrange one similar.”	221.87724963988524
“My first husband!” cried Milady, looking at Lord de Winter with eyes	238.482847970648
almost starting from their sockets.	348.4168586738467
“Yes, your French husband. I don’t speak of my brother. If you have	176.1124392812721
forgotten, as he is still living, I can write to him and he will send	216.09249013600203
me information on the subject.”	187.54416934156887
A cold sweat burst from the brow of Milady.	353.9393768293353
“You jest!” said she, in a hollow voice.	293.6669780333864
“Do I look so?” asked the baron, rising and going a step backward.	248.6735593353288
“Or rather you insult me,” continued she, pressing with her stiffened	254.7877057873232
hands the two arms of her easy chair, and raising herself upon her	239.39698232200845
wrists.	280.2953914478396
“I insult you!” said Lord de Winter, with contempt. “In truth, madame,	215.88196986470547
do you think that can be possible?”	299.6309402890439
“Indeed, sir,” said Milady, “you must be either drunk or mad. Leave the	249.50252325336265
room, and send me a woman.”	245.58033753688
“Women are very indiscreet, my sister. Cannot I serve you as a waiting	206.52085749640946
maid? By that means all our secrets will remain in the family.”	273.5530932259725
“Insolent!” cried Milady; and as if acted upon by a spring, she bounded	183.07771383591145
toward the baron, who awaited her attack with his arms crossed, but	317.1447133633428
nevertheless with one hand on the hilt of his sword.	337.5909780575398
“Come!” said he. “I know you are accustomed to assassinate people; but	178.1333715723348
I warn you I shall defend myself, even against you.”	224.45289659738916
“You are right,” said Milady. “You have all the appearance of being	333.6053335750223
cowardly enough to lift your hand against a woman.”	297.91873105273714
“Perhaps so; and I have an excuse, for mine would not be the first hand	315.34649305483606
of a man that has been placed upon you, I imagine.”	281.0454384802796
And the baron pointed, with a slow and accusing gesture, to the left	218.67336170608823
shoulder of Milady, which he almost touched with his finger.	301.85179630326036
Milady uttered a deep, inward shriek, and retreated to a corner of the	175.20180956528893
room like a panther which crouches for a spring.	336.45764805608576
“Oh, growl as much as you please,” cried Lord de Winter, “but don’t try	168.21095283602125
to bite, for I warn you that it would be to your disadvantage. There	185.1151742037095
are here no procurators who regulate successions beforehand. There is	260.9666479459289
no knight-errant to come and seek a quarrel with me on account of the	324.5098635973991
fair lady I detain a prisoner; but I have judges quite ready who will	284.96085210178444
quickly dispose of a woman so shameless as to glide, a bigamist, into	212.88232690002175
the bed of Lord de Winter, my brother. And these judges, I warn you,	290.30430975191814
will soon send you to an executioner who will make both your shoulders	209.12891040682268
alike.”	236.6998612384486
The eyes of Milady darted such flashes that although he was a man and	200.97144409983343
armed before an unarmed woman, he felt the chill of fear glide through	201.79381920544202
his whole frame. However, he continued all the same, but with	320.32294490039885
increasing warmth: “Yes, I can very well understand that after having	266.29588543556656
inherited the fortune of my brother it would be very agreeable to you	167.2681487999468
to be my heir likewise; but know beforehand, if you kill me or cause me	337.83042004735665
to be killed, my precautions are taken. Not a penny of what I possess	271.4232849469289
will pass into your hands. Were you not already rich enough—you who	330.050241352444
possess nearly a million? And could you not stop your fatal career, if	279.8576517763712
you did not do evil for the infinite and supreme joy of doing it? Oh,	325.67476692478465
be assured, if the memory of my brother were not sacred to me, you	315.80763684459794
should rot in a state dungeon or satisfy the curiosity of sailors at	176.82179711604374
Tyburn. I will be silent, but you must endure your captivity quietly.	355.3130484888185
In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the	295.35288780977
army; but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart	190.08745702831715
will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south. And be	267.76625293521045
assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains	321.54642545173886
out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the	298.4346382470379
Continent.”	192.98043854710093
Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes.	265.1544788809183
“Yes, at present,” continued Lord de Winter, “you will remain in this	236.41629252889675
castle. The walls are thick, the doors strong, and the bars solid;	363.6919607171071
besides, your window opens immediately over the sea. The men of my	244.73645182897997
crew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this	261.7571109811465
apartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even	204.32376862414392
if you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you	334.56017475338376
to pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your	217.28755624799277
part, denoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If	243.60891546126095
they kill you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for	335.81290949762854
having saved it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness,	268.65273051099734
your countenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself:	288.9948381117684
‘Fifteen days, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that	219.97366120981962
is expired some idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I	284.6468352601893
shall meet with a victim. Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be	299.98483195630274
away from here.’ Ah, try it!”	284.00057806926117
Milady, finding her thoughts betrayed, dug her nails into her flesh to	221.38808785011145
subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except	357.6660623289544
agony.	198.2128071181731
Lord de Winter continued: “The officer who commands here in my absence	326.2138571983798
you have already seen, and therefore know him. He knows how, as you	208.89802124304492
must have observed, to obey an order—for you did not, I am sure, come	166.36604887182082
from Portsmouth hither without endeavoring to make him speak. What do	177.2892067438093
you say of him? Could a statue of marble have been more impassive and	263.07670473954994
more mute? You have already tried the power of your seductions upon	193.4064476287788
many men, and unfortunately you have always succeeded; but I give you	179.03487392202447
leave to try them upon this one. _Pardieu!_ if you succeed with him, I	346.1220811679509
pronounce you the demon himself.”	344.9602757038672
He went toward the door and opened it hastily.	308.639110430854
“Call Mr. Felton,” said he. “Wait a minute longer, and I will introduce	218.65653611179178
him to you.”	173.56208074949944
There followed between these two personages a strange silence, during	272.73396996829183
which the sound of a slow and regular step was heard approaching.	170.98727074220943
Shortly a human form appeared in the shade of the corridor, and the	260.3219744941033
young lieutenant, with whom we are already acquainted, stopped at the	324.24309653626193
threshold to receive the orders of the baron.	317.42865201818853
“Come in, my dear John,” said Lord de Winter, “come in, and shut the	342.2374513204222
door.”	187.85057412681576
The young officer entered.	256.4825288391918
“Now,” said the baron, “look at this woman. She is young; she is	174.5399085861682
beautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a	196.318840731968
monster, who, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many	286.57397429792485
crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals.	211.85033203761893
Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a	226.90234577849074
bait to her victims; her body even pays what she promises—I must do her	322.5775819555348
that justice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill	214.83563216402456
you. I have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be	187.21801163948462
named lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I	255.75970775833733
am for you not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor,	200.30211762126163
but a father. This woman has come back again into England for the	250.96648750557014
purpose of conspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands.	285.7119982847887
Well, I call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard	171.09723037474572
me, and more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by	196.98475731654017
your hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she	355.38374832952
has merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith	315.86024123215003
in your loyalty!”	306.2189542998151
“My Lord,” said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance	283.9295346267937
all the hatred he could find in his heart, “my Lord, I swear all shall	336.55925497603664
be done as you desire.”	334.9710006220841
Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to	221.13699115307338
imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which	335.77272171252343
prevailed on her beautiful countenance. Lord de Winter himself could	185.56727858445777
scarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared	272.23738989117635
apparently for a fight.	354.43337638112916
“She is not to leave this chamber, understand, John,” continued the	225.30495577053944
baron. “She is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but	234.63196251120797
you—if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.”	190.81841459347504
“That is sufficient, my Lord! I have sworn.”	206.33743032342022
“And now, madame, try to make your peace with God, for you are judged	189.2592175309686
by men!”	313.10837614410906
Milady let her head sink, as if crushed by this sentence. Lord de	319.7432507998275
Winter went out, making a sign to Felton, who followed him, shutting	292.2775874677851
the door after him.	225.98088871986283
One instant after, the heavy step of a marine who served as sentinel	267.39775325995026
was heard in the corridor—his ax in his girdle and his musket on his	358.4643184910154
shoulder.	210.2250752929138
Milady remained for some minutes in the same position, for she thought	264.1830185128973
they might perhaps be examining her through the keyhole; she then	223.25039681297267
slowly raised her head, which had resumed its formidable expression of	333.5213365308251
menace and defiance, ran to the door to listen, looked out of her	222.78410146953817
window, and returning to bury herself again in her large armchair, she	276.14000225970625
reflected.	322.268828813666
Chapter LI.	328.4044910934723
OFFICER	355.8287512066911
Meanwhile, the cardinal looked anxiously for news from England; but no	200.38755032148808
news arrived that was not annoying and threatening.	166.0317174153965
Although La Rochelle was invested, however certain success might	355.5997430316894
appear—thanks to the precautions taken, and above all to the dyke,	213.04929746723397
which prevented the entrance of any vessel into the besieged city—the	174.08340065177342
blockade might last a long time yet. This was a great affront to the	240.6307695266445
king’s army, and a great inconvenience to the cardinal, who had no	265.88672585826714
longer, it is true, to embroil Louis XIII. with Anne of Austria—for that	232.03061710174006
affair was over—but he had to adjust matters for M. de Bassompierre,	363.729993909893
who was embroiled with the Duc d’Angoulême.	340.52816841785443
As to Monsieur, who had begun the siege, he left to the cardinal the	210.43674024148868
task of finishing it.	344.79834198610735
The city, notwithstanding the incredible perseverance of its mayor, had	327.954181958362
attempted a sort of mutiny for a surrender; the mayor had hanged the	328.1408882157863
mutineers. This execution quieted the ill-disposed, who resolved to	212.62675584775076
allow themselves to die of hunger—this death always appearing to them	224.8489262627647
more slow and less sure than strangulation.	261.87325717525476
On their side, from time to time, the besiegers took the messengers	354.22868535559974
which the Rochellais sent to Buckingham, or the spies which Buckingham	246.563463194701
sent to the Rochellais. In one case or the other, the trial was soon	221.5368378991767
over. The cardinal pronounced the single word, “Hanged!” The king was	231.31338923696558
invited to come and see the hanging. He came languidly, placing himself	299.7016709112068
in a good situation to see all the details. This amused him sometimes a	298.4373917437263
little, and made him endure the siege with patience; but it did not	216.39423919746966
prevent his getting very tired, or from talking at every moment of	245.61496826626816
returning to Paris—so that if the messengers and the spies had failed,	364.3803299939043
his Eminence, notwithstanding all his inventiveness, would have found	333.04271334005375
himself much embarrassed.	286.785945670125
Nevertheless, time passed on, and the Rochellais did not surrender. The	222.46227977249825
last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter. This letter told	276.58918823086447
Buckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding,	291.25091823092885
“If your succor does not arrive within fifteen days, we will	197.14158300347148
surrender,” it added, quite simply, “If your succor comes not within	237.64464436267025
fifteen days, we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes.”	309.1630820636045
The Rochellais, then, had no hope but in Buckingham. Buckingham was	187.76246365185537
their Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively	356.79528099135825
that they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with	252.089305521017
their hope.	317.3528997130363
The cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from	243.12610250148452
England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come.	178.40317083482353
The question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in	216.41460369549657
the council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place,	251.37777748342353
La Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said,	229.66707213215943
very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which	172.2262022939584
Frenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement of	199.02152615763723
sixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that	173.42223950271503
period what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La	253.08538691712556
Rochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who	361.17679602267674
allowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628,	256.8835565108298
the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this	357.2477407239188
extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good	231.30164775808274
Catholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging	304.4030847922387
generals—La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.	184.3210055993747
The cardinal could not drive from his mind the fear he entertained of	364.0095552838244
his terrible emissary—for he comprehended the strange qualities of this	290.7640609826693
woman, sometimes a serpent, sometimes a lion. Had she betrayed him? Was	355.7568271472197
she dead? He knew her well enough in all cases to know that, whether	227.74658772890925
acting for or against him, as a friend or an enemy, she would not	329.9209204470437
remain motionless without great impediments; but whence did these	198.91444671472573
impediments arise? That was what he could not know.	271.9235700161581
And yet he reckoned, and with reason, on Milady. He had divined in the	344.972291191374
past of this woman terrible things which his red mantle alone could	315.6797689728363
cover; and he felt, from one cause or another, that this woman was his	319.3043366862554
own, as she could look to no other but himself for a support superior	323.63384071706923
to the danger which threatened her.	357.7681425774114
He resolved, then, to carry on the war alone, and to look for no	349.3597205383313
success foreign to himself, but as we look for a fortunate chance. He	297.1257185577284
continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve	228.04828858517246
La Rochelle. Meanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city,	246.2119681264744
which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and	199.89528854829365
recalling the saying of Louis XI., his political predecessor, as he	317.2859412186998
himself was the predecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of	241.23975377490024
Tristan’s gossip: “Divide in order to reign.”	248.92641082176578
Henry IV., when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown over	239.91462244097625
the walls. The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he	305.56673102270554
represented to the Rochellais how unjust, selfish, and barbarous was	185.90603308695063
the conduct of their leaders. These leaders had corn in abundance, and	362.13074108429225
would not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim—for they,	322.08766538926193
too, had maxims—that it was of very little consequence that women,	215.882401258376
children, and old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend	293.71565163977493
the walls remained strong and healthy. Up to that time, whether from	178.98548242469312
devotedness or from want of power to act against it, this maxim,	302.4468696845064
without being generally adopted, nevertheless passed from theory into	289.5798952352603
practice; but the notes did it injury. The notes reminded the men that	331.5838725284127
the children, women, and old men whom they allowed to die were their	245.08348179950121
sons, their wives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just	235.35972530325233
for everyone to be reduced to the common misery, in order that equal	349.4307231541593
conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions.	205.40722967966227
These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect, in	271.86814249086297
that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private	174.2319829892954
negotiations with the royal army.	255.26766639134695
But at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing	256.9148814291356
fruit, and applauded himself for having put it in action, an inhabitant	269.0727573591057
of La Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines—God knows how,	348.8841686041128
such was the watchfulness of Bassompierre, Schomberg, and the Duc	199.40581675082836
d’Angoulême, themselves watched over by the cardinal—an inhabitant of	222.12369699484572
La Rochelle, we say, entered the city, coming from Portsmouth, and	302.4971408994382
saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight	169.4343111364592
days. Still further, Buckingham announced to the mayor that at length	315.0218323598397
the great league was about to declare itself against France, and that	291.1458162631897
the kingdom would be at once invaded by the English, Imperial, and	329.17849044788494
Spanish armies. This letter was read publicly in all parts of the city.	284.9879082605287
Copies were put up at the corners of the streets; and even they who had	236.4992989554558
begun to open negotiations interrupted them, being resolved to await	252.78006709264687
the succor so pompously announced.	297.7972293580229
This unexpected circumstance brought back Richelieu’s former anxiety,	169.00229092532967
and forced him in spite of himself once more to turn his eyes to the	212.17183413779003
other side of the sea.	293.5975155970744
During this time, exempt from the anxiety of its only and true chief,	318.2878145489274
the royal army led a joyous life, neither provisions nor money being	193.9567240697119
wanting in the camp. All the corps rivaled one another in audacity and	218.87887166588902
gaiety. To take spies and hang them, to make hazardous expeditions upon	225.26350691769488
the dyke or the sea, to imagine wild plans, and to execute them	297.1659001360701
coolly—such were the pastimes which made the army find these days short	197.11504674914966
which were not only so long to the Rochellais, a prey to famine and	253.60237668455989
anxiety, but even to the cardinal, who blockaded them so closely.	169.23491425488535
Sometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest	193.29992581991297
_gendarme_ of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so	188.36325726940998
slowly keeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from	332.89787069143773
all the corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a	345.0948392307722
Musketeer of the company of Tréville, he drew near and looked at him in	290.6963187788143
a peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four	227.77468605533008
companions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in	279.63906648299854
another direction.	227.00527479146305
One day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind, without hope in	326.5907824738911
the negotiations with the city, without news from England, the cardinal	324.80978170918814
went out, without any other aim than to be out of doors, and	252.34279976472249
accompanied only by Cahusac and La Houdinière, strolled along the	333.42462226274205
beach. Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the	279.756370052464
ocean, he came, his horse going at a foot’s pace, to a hill from the	175.34368390365208
top of which he perceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and	167.54393531724267
catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this	315.1637238908295
period of the year, seven men surrounded by empty bottles. Four of	287.253665126223
these men were our Musketeers, preparing to listen to a letter one of	168.375004667538
them had just received. This letter was so important that it made them	357.6723833415832
forsake their cards and their dice on the drumhead.	298.2747161570426
The other three were occupied in opening an enormous flagon of	321.4018668094956
Collicure wine; these were the lackeys of these gentlemen.	298.4512167510783
The cardinal was, as we have said, in very low spirits; and nothing	365.8150888089043
when he was in that state of mind increased his depression so much as	210.19084937535138
gaiety in others. Besides, he had another strange fancy, which was	186.26068165109598
always to believe that the causes of his sadness created the gaiety of	189.09597231609587
others. Making a sign to La Houdinière and Cahusac to stop, he alighted	318.9164149992258
from his horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions,	299.50573175734905
hoping, by means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and	227.0909234002261
of the hedge which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this	326.19286792287096
conversation which appeared so interesting. At ten paces from the hedge	169.3824604218698
he recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived	259.82950035835603
that these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others	217.88155948497968
were those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and	334.93074268350335
Aramis.	363.70901460484663
It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was	281.90726577029534
augmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and	169.3622856488406
with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had	252.53238434865997
not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any	350.3293088635136
positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and	249.36300740586552
attracted the attention of the Musketeers.	184.951597285937
“Officer!” cried Grimaud.	309.59740559174134
“You are speaking, you scoundrel!” said Athos, rising upon his elbow,	249.56457215676105
and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look.	263.9856720705796
Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself	297.0499961136559
with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge,	278.6754383790545
announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort.	168.34683653100015
With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with	243.5016451865506
respect.	234.53956554144682
The cardinal seemed furious.	304.7905462617018
“It appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,” said he. “Are	177.71467447648288
the English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves	263.03022463472524
superior officers?”	274.970642568043
“Monseigneur,” replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone had	248.280685177999
preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him,	168.5681194028911
“Monseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their	223.0192505214633
duty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior	238.59395179119596
officers to their lackeys.”	287.0957016037084
“Lackeys?” grumbled the cardinal. “Lackeys who have the order to warn	348.10244044056265
their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys, they are sentinels.”	275.5754738679241
“Your Eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution,	179.68829102319827
we should have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting	170.16368326946838
you our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done	321.1236557565935
us in uniting us. D’Artagnan,” continued Athos, “you, who but lately	228.3250830779497
were so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude	311.74357092112143
to Monseigneur, here it is; avail yourself of it.”	332.2242771731512
These words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which	290.2293354613252
distinguished Athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive	226.4631077358969
politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic	299.33800194268235
than kings by birth.	190.16869490624308
D’Artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude	312.8588734360095
which soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal.	304.5016455662915
“It does not signify, gentlemen,” continued the cardinal, without	347.2266623007297
appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the	283.7337006632497
diversion which Athos had started, “it does not signify, gentlemen. I	311.00628411745356
do not like to have simple soldiers, because they have the advantage of	281.88346880643
serving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline	259.49926640031936
is the same for them as for everybody else.”	189.98835742326543
Athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and bowed	311.60684893419767
in sign of assent. Then he resumed in his turn: “Discipline,	295.4433560833983
Monseigneur, has, I hope, in no way been forgotten by us. We are not on	203.06660639025466
duty, and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to	224.37360708019057
dispose of our time as we pleased. If we are so fortunate as to have	335.50049054388853
some particular duty to perform for your Eminence, we are ready to obey	263.9596980458213
you. Your Eminence may perceive,” continued Athos, knitting his brow,	360.9621819057094
for this sort of investigation began to annoy him, “that we have not	203.10990997208026
come out without our arms.”	217.33839695130413
And he showed the cardinal, with his finger, the four muskets piled	284.10178733060025
near the drum, on which were the cards and dice.	216.2636239397521
“Your Eminence may believe,” added D’Artagnan, “that we would have come	169.25028573349255
to meet you, if we could have supposed it was Monseigneur coming toward	316.84174826464033
us with so few attendants.”	219.22784878018874
The cardinal bit his mustache, and even his lips a little.	333.11948202537053
“Do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and	260.29052398622497
guarded by your lackeys?” said the cardinal. “You look like four	285.37317870437306
conspirators.”	307.3539185117356
“Oh, as to that, Monseigneur, it is true,” said Athos; “we do conspire,	291.4725041354301
as your Eminence might have seen the other morning. Only we conspire	213.24975650617887
against the Rochellais.”	336.79719012749456
“Ah, you gentlemen of policy!” replied the cardinal, knitting his brow	289.58086004002206
in his turn, “the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found	255.66414555878617
in your brains, if we could read them as you read that letter which you	264.9703559116599
concealed as soon as you saw me coming.”	265.2224990734811
The color mounted to the face of Athos, and he made a step toward his	276.7235156068274
Eminence.	307.49327110139285
“One might think you really suspected us, monseigneur, and we were	176.708268039571
undergoing a real interrogatory. If it be so, we trust your Eminence	286.90096118594886
will deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be	168.23276897306363
acquainted with our real position.”	279.04944826421934
“And if it were an interrogatory!” replied the cardinal. “Others	299.9624421001812
besides you have undergone such, Monsieur Athos, and have replied	320.7357836437631
thereto.”	177.73488893488198
“Thus I have told your Eminence that you had but to question us, and we	237.3726735381009
are ready to reply.”	173.88717044135248
“What was that letter you were about to read, Monsieur Aramis, and	339.45860226906336
which you so promptly concealed?”	198.58633558043465
“A woman’s letter, monseigneur.”	197.81961254699178
“Ah, yes, I see,” said the cardinal; “we must be discreet with this	170.3465395250448
sort of letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and	303.62491233875164
you know I have taken orders.”	302.9212582409763
“Monseigneur,” said Athos, with a calmness the more terrible because he	361.5079115194555
risked his head in making this reply, “the letter is a woman’s letter,	224.6244920144125
but it is neither signed Marion de Lorme, nor Madame d’Aiguillon.”	341.66618689126994
The cardinal became as pale as death; lightning darted from his eyes.	269.62393517795533
He turned round as if to give an order to Cahusac and Houdinière. Athos	202.06485319457406
saw the movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the	172.59310136066543
other three friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to	224.09115049479027
allow themselves to be taken. The cardinalists were three; the	243.90180365405155
Musketeers, lackeys included, were seven. He judged that the match	232.33902813876023
would be so much the less equal, if Athos and his companions were	333.07334572104105
really plotting; and by one of those rapid turns which he always had at	274.12252562577163
command, all his anger faded away into a smile.	274.9078299705106
“Well, well!” said he, “you are brave young men, proud in daylight,	189.82458773554703
faithful in darkness. We can find no fault with you for watching over	183.77249424336276
yourselves, when you watch so carefully over others. Gentlemen, I have	221.510368397448
not forgotten the night in which you served me as an escort to the Red	266.54430575000197
Dovecot. If there were any danger to be apprehended on the road I am	245.04461984359878
going, I would request you to accompany me; but as there is none,	294.05300449413653
remain where you are, finish your bottles, your game, and your letter.	330.15190178910336
Adieu, gentlemen!”	228.09065351723905
And remounting his horse, which Cahusac led to him, he saluted them	282.131211307445
with his hand, and rode away.	177.18737266292064
The four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their	214.2562181418126
eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. Then they	323.9691551996992
looked at one another.	289.6181602696584
The countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding	311.6636974536258
the friendly adieu of his Eminence, they plainly perceived that the	237.71101403973813
cardinal went away with rage in his heart.	234.08504397010762
Athos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.	357.81228107598247
When the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, “That Grimaud kept bad	169.6605685249539
watch!” cried Porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his	202.81580993595014
ill-humor on somebody.	340.26680462455755
Grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. Athos lifted his finger,	252.39642316464443
and Grimaud was silent.	208.4703824731722
“Would you have given up the letter, Aramis?” said D’Artagnan.	280.38360649588515
“I,” said Aramis, in his most flutelike tone, “I had made up my mind.	271.79983452128795
If he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him, I would have	230.9932317808442
presented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other I would	226.4856926572379
have run my sword through his body.”	265.0980181099397
“I expected as much,” said Athos; “and that was why I threw myself	241.69355870667061
between you and him. Indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking	350.55542324533116
thus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but	302.74395547542895
women and children.”	263.5924253709461
“My dear Athos, I admire you, but nevertheless we were in the wrong,	289.27235472020584
after all.”	362.3385385588565
“How, in the wrong?” said Athos. “Whose, then, is the air we breathe?	228.5810004564732
Whose is the ocean upon which we look? Whose is the sand upon which we	293.74369440293873
were reclining? Whose is that letter of your mistress? Do these belong	305.7696694199698
to the cardinal? Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to	364.95716819602984
him. There you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. One might	305.0625378989325
have supposed the Bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic	301.66811325680203
Medusa had converted you into stone. Is being in love conspiring? You	318.117786002854
are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up,	247.24747374626014
and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. That’s a	217.10967182508278
match you are playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game. Why	194.61259471796956
should you expose your game to your adversary? That is never done. Let	276.85331941475783
him find it out if he can! We can find out his!”	176.85295725530156
“Well, that’s all very sensible, Athos,” said D’Artagnan.	187.236923395184
“In that case, let there be no more question of what’s past, and let	222.4867647594001
Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted	267.7407175399768
him.”	252.2227247228376
Aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded	282.75164384835347
him, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.	251.839924924532
“You had only read a line or two,” said D’Artagnan; “read the letter	337.30757071318044
again from the commencement.”	306.02434485119466
“Willingly,” said Aramis.	274.4639946034705
“MY DEAR COUSIN, I think I shall make up my mind to set out for	278.6234874045796
Béthune, where my sister has placed our little servant in the convent	330.13436418662474
of the Carmelites; this poor child is quite resigned, as she knows she	308.47556675118597
cannot live elsewhere without the salvation of her soul being in	242.26082089986662
danger. Nevertheless, if the affairs of our family are arranged, as we	211.71811474044472
hope they will be, I believe she will run the risk of being damned, and	342.6715531322226
will return to those she regrets, particularly as she knows they are	231.6453312417474
always thinking of her. Meanwhile, she is not very wretched; what she	279.8880888047636
most desires is a letter from her intended. I know that such viands	199.10788792157211
pass with difficulty through convent gratings; but after all, as I have	188.4385906716042
given you proofs, my dear cousin, I am not unskilled in such affairs,	167.36637658209864
and I will take charge of the commission. My sister thanks you for your	258.82598420951
good and eternal remembrance. She has experienced much anxiety; but she	306.10534690818395
is now at length a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in	256.48720071551185
order that nothing may happen unexpectedly.	338.35362688762524
    “Adieu, my dear cousin. Tell us news of yourself as often as you	297.1242739918531
    can; that is to say, as often as you can with safety. I embrace	309.54931025373594
    you.	297.20981095486536
“MARIE MICHON”	317.75492030898147
“Oh, what do I not owe you, Aramis?” said D’Artagnan. “Dear Constance!	178.05657850654416
I have at length, then, intelligence of you. She lives; she is in	315.8181760074939
safety in a convent; she is at Béthune! Where is Béthune, Athos?”	175.45475327072006
“Why, upon the frontiers of Artois and of Flanders. The siege once	304.37704435427395
over, we shall be able to make a tour in that direction.”	266.1202883793723
“And that will not be long, it is to be hoped,” said Porthos; “for they	288.69047145667713
have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the Rochellais were	172.9660763427159
reduced to the leather of their shoes. Supposing that after having	330.6171182528036
eaten the leather they eat the soles, I cannot see much that is left	264.83108526509034
unless they eat one another.”	270.8430170712276
“Poor fools!” said Athos, emptying a glass of excellent Bordeaux wine	186.6816318276242
which, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,	318.1763525968705
merited it no less, “poor fools! As if the Catholic religion was not	276.0895528893564
the most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions! All the	292.9330687857798
same,” resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate,	268.31668587389436
“they are brave fellows! But what the devil are you about, Aramis?”	364.67785298105673
continued Athos. “Why, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!”	324.9418772416547
“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “Athos is right, it must be burned. And yet if	177.89495659327375
we burn it, who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to	174.56868455462734
interrogate ashes?”	209.20538762798714
“He must have one,” said Athos.	324.6770168566025
“What will you do with the letter, then?” asked Porthos.	357.1392155764953
“Come here, Grimaud,” said Athos. Grimaud rose and obeyed. “As a	227.36781818117214
punishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will	346.55919440680844
please to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the	279.25253644815155
service you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass	263.5456655446343
of wine. First, here is the letter. Eat heartily.”	198.18775400718403
Grimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held	284.45832535344954
in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then	292.71873322873194
swallowed it.	219.73195016786846
“Bravo, Monsieur Grimaud!” said Athos; “and now take this. That’s well.	308.69426020303104
We dispense with your saying grace.”	260.82397150522905
Grimaud silently swallowed the glass of Bordeaux wine; but his eyes,	183.27167575758702
raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language	254.76762292678296
which, though mute, was not the less expressive.	230.45907361552025
“And now,” said Athos, “unless Monsieur Cardinal should form the	207.02598426999947
ingenious idea of ripping up Grimaud, I think we may be pretty much at	235.55436438341093
our ease respecting the letter.”	177.46302106095246
Meantime, his Eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring between	236.40292451101925
his mustaches, “These four men must positively be mine.”	288.60008732314793
Chapter LII.	317.8996718427916
CAPTIVITY: THE FIRST DAY	361.07193961814187
Let us return to Milady, whom a glance thrown upon the coast of France	362.4011845368808
has made us lose sight of for an instant.	176.2983772052699
We shall find her still in the despairing attitude in which we left	176.83736432013583
her, plunged in an abyss of dismal reflection—a dark hell at the gate	359.86062452166993
of which she has almost left hope behind, because for the first time	268.20815153977253
she doubts, for the first time she fears.	324.59863885533366
On two occasions her fortune has failed her, on two occasions she has	347.9288589670998
found herself discovered and betrayed; and on these two occasions it	270.4032985090192
was to one fatal genius, sent doubtlessly by the Lord to combat her,	280.51469491051444
that she has succumbed. D’Artagnan has conquered her—her, that	254.23313412024262
invincible power of evil.	202.25555447068388
He has deceived her in her love, humbled her in her pride, thwarted her	211.97454301957947
in her ambition; and now he ruins her fortune, deprives her of liberty,	339.6059697501801
and even threatens her life. Still more, he has lifted the corner of	202.22923356641454
her mask—that shield with which she covered herself and which rendered	229.38096674867106
her so strong.	270.7201068614954
D’Artagnan has turned aside from Buckingham, whom she hates as she	189.37296239973176
hates everyone she has loved, the tempest with which Richelieu	226.04554150331262
threatened him in the person of the queen. D’Artagnan had passed	348.5018398461485
himself upon her as De Wardes, for whom she had conceived one of those	297.72419470109014
tigerlike fancies common to women of her character. D’Artagnan knows	167.5034186231594
that terrible secret which she has sworn no one shall know without	194.65556111204864
dying. In short, at the moment in which she has just obtained from	309.60748886488574
Richelieu a _carte blanche_ by the means of which she is about to take	182.37636559982934
vengeance on her enemy, this precious paper is torn from her hands, and	357.7124464318952
it is D’Artagnan who holds her prisoner and is about to send her to	255.33325448505275
some filthy Botany Bay, some infamous Tyburn of the Indian Ocean.	317.4683412106808
All this she owes to D’Artagnan, without doubt. From whom can come so	210.02026276061187
many disgraces heaped upon her head, if not from him? He alone could	352.4145731051808
have transmitted to Lord de Winter all these frightful secrets which he	355.3548832044799
has discovered, one after another, by a train of fatalities. He knows	209.0615303613195
her brother-in-law. He must have written to him.	183.32054835659633
What hatred she distills! Motionless, with her burning and fixed	265.6974517694995
glances, in her solitary apartment, how well the outbursts of passion	349.77608326675073
which at times escape from the depths of her chest with her	331.979754238199
respiration, accompany the sound of the surf which rises, growls,	309.4583566276681
roars, and breaks itself like an eternal and powerless despair against	195.0181422555886
the rocks on which is built this dark and lofty castle! How many	300.80308565873554
magnificent projects of vengeance she conceives by the light of the	336.4484656206724
flashes which her tempestuous passion casts over her mind against Mme.	190.38651852530833
Bonacieux, against Buckingham, but above all against	298.0245974335638
D’Artagnan—projects lost in the distance of the future.	205.84192573233304
Yes; but in order to avenge herself she must be free. And to be free, a	324.2826105681951
prisoner has to pierce a wall, detach bars, cut through a floor—all	221.07396787816282
undertakings which a patient and strong man may accomplish, but before	173.78128127977502
which the feverish irritations of a woman must give way. Besides, to do	321.2520781855777
all this, time is necessary—months, years; and she has ten or twelve	284.96619908336424
days, as Lord de Winter, her fraternal and terrible jailer, has told	234.45516808036064
her.	326.75757114232596
And yet, if she were a man she would attempt all this, and perhaps	247.91250344121858
might succeed; why, then, did heaven make the mistake of placing that	356.6034841806327
manlike soul in that frail and delicate body?	324.78400399684585
The first moments of her captivity were terrible; a few convulsions of	293.32905744378667
rage which she could not suppress paid her debt of feminine weakness to	295.3243698639734
nature. But by degrees she overcame the outbursts of her mad passion;	250.10668938912517
and nervous tremblings which agitated her frame disappeared, and she	284.26387297678997
remained folded within herself like a fatigued serpent in repose.	271.1044528915459
“Go to, go to! I must have been mad to allow myself to be carried away	358.7462608898065
so,” says she, gazing into the glass, which reflects back to her eyes	290.7724882149124
the burning glance by which she appears to interrogate herself. “No	227.84890315515082
violence; violence is the proof of weakness. In the first place, I have	246.17573230704227
never succeeded by that means. Perhaps if I employed my strength	195.92408069283977
against women I might perchance find them weaker than myself, and	354.30068561324333
consequently conquer them; but it is with men that I struggle, and I am	302.0245088482235
but a woman to them. Let me fight like a woman, then; my strength is in	195.09392593305483
my weakness.”	362.48426990238676
Then, as if to render an account to herself of the changes she could	364.4266231452662
place upon her countenance, so mobile and so expressive, she made it	326.8127688930535
take all expressions from that of passionate anger, which convulsed her	329.5734908375015
features, to that of the most sweet, most affectionate, and most	304.3949959434241
seducing smile. Then her hair assumed successively, under her skillful	221.94753501889028
hands, all the undulations she thought might assist the charms of her	327.03375662236465
face. At length she murmured, satisfied with herself, “Come, nothing is	316.1336846230862
lost; I am still beautiful.”	364.98404443466796
It was then nearly eight o’clock in the evening. Milady perceived a	309.73033566395816
bed; she calculated that the repose of a few hours would not only	228.0423933349769
refresh her head and her ideas, but still further, her complexion. A	337.1613012772781
better idea, however, came into her mind before going to bed. She had	206.7813185045129
heard something said about supper. She had already been an hour in this	354.92106861500054
apartment; they could not long delay bringing her a repast. The	227.534916484119
prisoner did not wish to lose time; and she resolved to make that very	210.8423681182668
evening some attempts to ascertain the nature of the ground she had to	259.84478782832224
work upon, by studying the characters of the men to whose guardianship	324.50764720849395
she was committed.	252.66867049011455
A light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance	270.3654058024594
of her jailers. Milady, who had arisen, threw herself quickly into the	341.6113138140865
armchair, her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and	244.42666642041158
disheveled, her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace, one hand on	189.76092922314325
her heart, and the other hanging down.	262.1444355493616
The bolts were drawn; the door groaned upon its hinges. Steps sounded	365.27968602922886
in the chamber, and drew near.	310.492952001441
“Place that table there,” said a voice which the prisoner recognized as	269.2013437367169
that of Felton.	235.5673517303747
The order was executed.	342.97730384413194
“You will bring lights, and relieve the sentinel,” continued Felton.	332.0738359155529
And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same	285.6955238152725
individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her	234.53283225362668
guards; that is to say, soldiers.	174.35978201124868
Felton’s orders were, for the rest, executed with a silent rapidity	219.92967551291684
that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline.	356.2767802634489
At length Felton, who had not yet looked at Milady, turned toward her.	336.3795727468711
“Ah, ah!” said he, “she is asleep; that’s well. When she wakes she can	275.0552927338141
sup.” And he made some steps toward the door.	332.2189771438501
“But, my lieutenant,” said a soldier, less stoical than his chief, and	277.9739157454185
who had approached Milady, “this woman is not asleep.”	341.50855061408987
“What, not asleep!” said Felton; “what is she doing, then?”	220.9210877881287
“She has fainted. Her face is very pale, and I have listened in vain; I	353.71421972079753
do not hear her breathe.”	205.91962072416905
“You are right,” said Felton, after having looked at Milady from the	279.66591079750793
spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her. “Go and tell	327.4851185844153
Lord de Winter that his prisoner has fainted—for this event not having	362.5238293480331
been foreseen, I don’t know what to do.”	217.2195825399438
The soldier went out to obey the orders of his officer. Felton sat down	304.5710663631549
upon an armchair which happened to be near the door, and waited without	215.8821468787866
speaking a word, without making a gesture. Milady possessed that great	209.1667541640635
art, so much studied by women, of looking through her long eyelashes	193.36348340978597
without appearing to open the lids. She perceived Felton, who sat with	359.70484315748274
his back toward her. She continued to look at him for nearly ten	345.04240839738395
minutes, and in these ten minutes the immovable guardian never turned	223.93357515922375
round once.	250.00132499937223
She then thought that Lord de Winter would come, and by his presence	295.1016174097057
give fresh strength to her jailer. Her first trial was lost; she acted	206.8324479430163
like a woman who reckons up her resources. As a result she raised her	223.63923497941582
head, opened her eyes, and sighed deeply.	232.59789267929426
At this sigh Felton turned round.	247.0292243593916
“Ah, you are awake, madame,” he said; “then I have nothing more to do	283.7257518124379
here. If you want anything you can ring.”	182.81821495773886
“Oh, my God, my God! how I have suffered!” said Milady, in that	352.31371826144425
harmonious voice which, like that of the ancient enchantresses, charmed	228.7288107542675
all whom she wished to destroy.	190.74789247119577
And she assumed, upon sitting up in the armchair, a still more graceful	203.01507960215346
and abandoned position than when she reclined.	265.7905115220773
Felton arose.	242.13912431405407
“You will be served, thus, madame, three times a day,” said he. “In the	290.88366295641015
morning at nine o’clock, in the day at one o’clock, and in the evening	312.26640242410735
at eight. If that does not suit you, you can point out what other hours	248.40284965685814
you prefer, and in this respect your wishes will be complied with.”	232.40610411067007
“But am I to remain always alone in this vast and dismal chamber?”	220.64108208001463
asked Milady.	331.1740144418085
“A woman of the neighbourhood has been sent for, who will be tomorrow	175.17202119220747
at the castle, and will return as often as you desire her presence.”	294.239346732943
“I thank you, sir,” replied the prisoner, humbly.	302.5112759290443
Felton made a slight bow, and directed his steps toward the door. At	292.6999180937846
the moment he was about to go out, Lord de Winter appeared in the	182.4910801966986
corridor, followed by the soldier who had been sent to inform him of	259.67009547191225
the swoon of Milady. He held a vial of salts in his hand.	357.5055233883385
“Well, what is it—what is going on here?” said he, in a jeering voice,	259.5001715440666
on seeing the prisoner sitting up and Felton about to go out. “Is this	340.4903949308141
corpse come to life already? Felton, my lad, did you not perceive that	222.77836705703487
you were taken for a novice, and that the first act was being performed	312.5802380881354
of a comedy of which we shall doubtless have the pleasure of following	307.3453033258017
out all the developments?”	340.6133973536528
“I thought so, my lord,” said Felton; “but as the prisoner is a woman,	182.19489973293093
after all, I wish to pay her the attention that every man of gentle	247.85152113650543
birth owes to a woman, if not on her account, at least on my own.”	330.33532481988345
Milady shuddered through her whole system. These words of Felton’s	277.91164697408607
passed like ice through her veins.	231.12651676728484
“So,” replied de Winter, laughing, “that beautiful hair so skillfully	280.2878894178397
disheveled, that white skin, and that languishing look, have not yet	259.3782348817159
seduced you, you heart of stone?”	249.79946412062424
“No, my Lord,” replied the impassive young man; “your Lordship may be	316.39822727597027
assured that it requires more than the tricks and coquetry of a woman	209.13094704266337
to corrupt me.”	351.74727449109423
“In that case, my brave lieutenant, let us leave Milady to find out	211.1217310695384
something else, and go to supper; but be easy! She has a fruitful	178.5937032548852
imagination, and the second act of the comedy will not delay its steps	350.74601389395355
after the first.”	264.6307715802944
And at these words Lord de Winter passed his arm through that of	263.1307182505183
Felton, and led him out, laughing.	237.11238230861937
“Oh, I will be a match for you!” murmured Milady, between her teeth;	243.3840582290114
“be assured of that, you poor spoiled monk, you poor converted soldier,	210.31284619190313
who has cut his uniform out of a monk’s frock!”	298.8049409192171
“By the way,” resumed de Winter, stopping at the threshold of the door,	320.2279975978944
“you must not, Milady, let this check take away your appetite. Taste	271.41702606273395
that fowl and those fish. On my honor, they are not poisoned. I have a	264.225460059307
very good cook, and he is not to be my heir; I have full and perfect	350.86612535643405
confidence in him. Do as I do. Adieu, dear sister, till your next	360.13044578240505
swoon!”	237.30641666553603
This was all that Milady could endure. Her hands clutched her armchair;	352.6203374446477
she ground her teeth inwardly; her eyes followed the motion of the door	285.31379623960845
as it closed behind Lord de Winter and Felton, and the moment she was	219.60367971771433
alone a fresh fit of despair seized her. She cast her eyes upon the	222.71159746289658
table, saw the glittering of a knife, rushed toward it and clutched it;	330.7044525397837
but her disappointment was cruel. The blade was round, and of flexible	258.6415097998141
silver.	282.53056897640397
A burst of laughter resounded from the other side of the ill-closed	346.8412505076426
door, and the door reopened.	329.8671364431338
“Ha, ha!” cried Lord de Winter; “ha, ha! Don’t you see, my brave	199.94582972573554
Felton; don’t you see what I told you? That knife was for you, my lad;	240.91868433398852
she would have killed you. Observe, this is one of her peculiarities,	287.5787086254854
to get rid thus, after one fashion or another, of all the people who	356.62921238397155
bother her. If I had listened to you, the knife would have been pointed	272.44928263925357
and of steel. Then no more of Felton; she would have cut your throat,	174.1303690691767
and after that everybody else’s. See, John, see how well she knows how	183.0315419899467
to handle a knife.”	304.49548311613705
In fact, Milady still held the harmless weapon in her clenched hand;	229.98810962649574
but these last words, this supreme insult, relaxed her hands, her	181.52552243870142
strength, and even her will. The knife fell to the ground.	323.06290701275486
“You were right, my Lord,” said Felton, with a tone of profound disgust	260.06693639758214
which sounded to the very bottom of the heart of Milady, “you were	191.03294841627758
right, my Lord, and I was wrong.”	346.8629441639013
And both again left the room.	187.83902434702682
But this time Milady lent a more attentive ear than the first, and she	300.1835239238611
heard their steps die away in the distance of the corridor.	332.97575906411396
“I am lost,” murmured she; “I am lost! I am in the power of men upon	360.2789692721233
whom I can have no more influence than upon statues of bronze or	287.85400273318635
granite; they know me by heart, and are steeled against all my weapons.	363.330726531668
It is, however, impossible that this should end as they have decreed!”	258.1827809679341
In fact, as this last reflection indicated—this instinctive return to	317.25174519883114
hope—sentiments of weakness or fear did not dwell long in her ardent	203.8414509079092
spirit. Milady sat down to table, ate from several dishes, drank a	235.48267480522173
little Spanish wine, and felt all her resolution return.	217.9701521560529
Before she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides,	199.30388687322784
examined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs,	248.54226402278266
and even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound,	322.14111878460255
skillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything	202.08601146889944
considered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors.	231.01718833877993
One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: “If I	217.83862326029677
had listened to you,” Lord de Winter had said to Felton.	333.7931331291607
Felton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not	212.3582480212831
been willing to listen to him.	248.38568870022044
“Weak or strong,” repeated Milady, “that man has, then, a spark of pity	196.89227842149467
in his soul; of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him.	309.73091946263776
As to the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to	275.48518519594154
expect of me if ever I escape from his hands. It is useless, then, to	235.1970084006793
attempt anything with him. But Felton—that’s another thing. He is a	337.8866676598851
young, ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of	343.765579842791
destroying.”	317.5547428231809
And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.	253.18722335187363
Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl	349.5067816014458
dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the	231.91817232057025
next festival.	318.77521291370306
Chapter LIII.	176.0019795937613
CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY	213.51630131766711
Milady dreamed that she at length had D’Artagnan in her power, that she	309.2984098148752
was present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood,	248.34106048701534
flowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming	357.21039580756656
smile upon her lips.	193.88857913791827
She slept as a prisoner sleeps, rocked by his first hope.	184.48852599985452
In the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed.	170.48218442544223
Felton remained in the corridor. He brought with him the woman of whom	233.5164867519717
he had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman	286.1792876155511
entered, and approaching Milady’s bed, offered her services.	235.79940313003593
Milady was habitually pale; her complexion might therefore deceive a	274.2947169644624
person who saw her for the first time.	290.27961638710536
“I am in a fever,” said she; “I have not slept a single instant during	253.78177965959424
all this long night. I suffer horribly. Are you likely to be more	251.43925091826952
humane to me than others were yesterday? All I ask is permission to	227.82947042701454
remain abed.”	356.342905384232
“Would you like to have a physician called?” said the woman.	327.45963830160554
Felton listened to this dialogue without speaking a word.	170.30946122119275
Milady reflected that the more people she had around her the more she	192.8143578417454
would have to work upon, and Lord de Winter would redouble his watch.	177.22380604677176
Besides, the physician might declare the ailment feigned; and Milady,	342.3116657674027
after having lost the first trick, was not willing to lose the second.	188.23063680362952
“Go and fetch a physician?” said she. “What could be the good of that?	304.3120849828836
These gentlemen declared yesterday that my illness was a comedy; it	290.84034018871745
would be just the same today, no doubt—for since yesterday evening they	357.68255057434226
have had plenty of time to send for a doctor.”	199.75514882777338
“Then,” said Felton, who became impatient, “say yourself, madame, what	184.26021108164048
treatment you wish followed.”	234.8859926892406
“Eh, how can I tell? My God! I know that I suffer, that’s all. Give me	260.35143564941427
anything you like, it is of little consequence.”	240.5118683081795
“Go and fetch Lord de Winter,” said Felton, tired of these eternal	347.8828210067915
complaints.	349.3302836295284
“Oh, no, no!” cried Milady; “no, sir, do not call him, I conjure you. I	222.65720090108096
am well, I want nothing; do not call him.”	204.3387827639902
She gave so much vehemence, such magnetic eloquence to this	277.8070891423117
exclamation, that Felton in spite of himself advanced some steps into	212.34591097026043
the room.	356.82349450875984
“He has come!” thought Milady.	176.53972378297635
“Meanwhile, madame, if you really suffer,” said Felton, “a physician	174.889410448466
shall be sent for; and if you deceive us—well, it will be the worse for	256.99257672895794
you. But at least we shall not have to reproach ourselves with	286.63374000269755
anything.”	233.91542884349818
Milady made no reply, but turning her beautiful head round upon her	307.26497368522587
pillow, she burst into tears, and uttered heartbreaking sobs.	364.45684337725595
Felton surveyed her for an instant with his usual impassiveness; then,	173.97549777074255
seeing that the crisis threatened to be prolonged, he went out. The	234.97724270588603
woman followed him, and Lord de Winter did not appear.	254.94830713272188
“I fancy I begin to see my way,” murmured Milady, with a savage joy,	364.6326618885418
burying herself under the clothes to conceal from anybody who might be	168.17244022717114
watching her this burst of inward satisfaction.	332.4998511492329
Two hours passed away.	259.4618140605463
“Now it is time that the malady should be over,” said she; “let me	241.6957410325805
rise, and obtain some success this very day. I have but ten days, and	348.73671236320394
this evening two of them will be gone.”	361.74786626864693
In the morning, when they entered Milady’s chamber they had brought her	346.3413681327083
breakfast. Now, she thought, they could not long delay coming to clear	192.60512767580894
the table, and that Felton would then reappear.	259.5585432130012
Milady was not deceived. Felton reappeared, and without observing	261.4360774202895
whether Milady had or had not touched her repast, made a sign that the	289.98324526347096
table should be carried out of the room, it having been brought in	218.18658155460142
ready spread.	238.86207563199417
Felton remained behind; he held a book in his hand.	336.7936977670747
Milady, reclining in an armchair near the chimney, beautiful, pale, and	281.8210240985451
resigned, looked like a holy virgin awaiting martyrdom.	319.3955745809782
Felton approached her, and said, “Lord de Winter, who is a Catholic,	227.8222751721466
like yourself, madame, thinking that the deprivation of the rites and	347.21332151688887
ceremonies of your church might be painful to you, has consented that	323.3128807725328
you should read every day the ordinary of your Mass; and here is a book	262.86850344407435
which contains the ritual.”	325.06445903170584
At the manner in which Felton laid the book upon the little table near	166.46772399594434
which Milady was sitting, at the tone in which he pronounced the two	341.8961164369613
words, _your Mass_, at the disdainful smile with which he accompanied	287.6432113923542
them, Milady raised her head, and looked more attentively at the	202.07049218053854
officer.	241.8981055467532
By that plain arrangement of the hair, by that costume of extreme	272.7953198174261
simplicity, by the brow polished like marble and as hard and	265.5322979219517
impenetrable, she recognized one of those gloomy Puritans she had so	177.71549951610388
often met, not only in the court of King James, but in that of the King	307.06748854449324
of France, where, in spite of the remembrance of the St. Bartholomew,	188.72026779399408
they sometimes came to seek refuge.	313.41376563311314
She then had one of those sudden inspirations which only people of	212.51000187844232
genius receive in great crises, in supreme moments which are to decide	285.2784441928251
their fortunes or their lives.	168.61968148814142
Those two words, _your Mass_, and a simple glance cast upon Felton,	269.24529801813196
revealed to her all the importance of the reply she was about to make;	197.32831949306546
but with that rapidity of intelligence which was peculiar to her, this	339.61775640054907
reply, ready arranged, presented itself to her lips:	321.3641513283683
“I?” said she, with an accent of disdain in unison with that which she	312.624099311862
had remarked in the voice of the young officer, “I, sir? _My Mass?_	319.4210595626628
Lord de Winter, the corrupted Catholic, knows very well that I am not	330.56598311529723
of his religion, and this is a snare he wishes to lay for me!”	349.3434823001236
“And of what religion are you, then, madame?” asked Felton, with an	167.14818364792777
astonishment which in spite of the empire he held over himself he could	212.00419788863144
not entirely conceal.	275.3092887966153
“I will tell it,” cried Milady, with a feigned exultation, “on the day	328.52241373489505
when I shall have suffered sufficiently for my faith.”	350.79157784726453
The look of Felton revealed to Milady the full extent of the space she	184.79334648989945
had opened for herself by this single word.	318.85495674809135
The young officer, however, remained mute and motionless; his look	186.5557391101026
alone had spoken.	206.18949747476097
“I am in the hands of my enemies,” continued she, with that tone of	302.01220944393725
enthusiasm which she knew was familiar to the Puritans. “Well, let my	270.02948735520533
God save me, or let me perish for my God! That is the reply I beg you	339.24423550140534
to make to Lord de Winter. And as to this book,” added she, pointing to	206.48330534105128
the manual with her finger but without touching it, as if she must be	219.47728761229234
contaminated by it, “you may carry it back and make use of it yourself,	272.2416195600217
for doubtless you are doubly the accomplice of Lord de Winter—the	365.08555781760117
accomplice in his persecutions, the accomplice in his heresies.”	338.626868641153
Felton made no reply, took the book with the same appearance of	253.86241478133337
repugnance which he had before manifested, and retired pensively.	289.60132627526934
Lord de Winter came toward five o’clock in the evening. Milady had had	195.9534373855297
time, during the whole day, to trace her plan of conduct. She received	316.95062449610987
him like a woman who had already recovered all her advantages.	294.87030497138215
“It appears,” said the baron, seating himself in the armchair opposite	300.15302049220224
that occupied by Milady, and stretching out his legs carelessly upon	269.38941845315856
the hearth, “it appears we have made a little apostasy!”	362.9594781180787
“What do you mean, sir!”	242.32563627457347
“I mean to say that since we last met you have changed your religion.	337.4780161487384
You have not by chance married a Protestant for a third husband, have	269.72465580473903
you?”	228.87777742754523
“Explain yourself, my Lord,” replied the prisoner, with majesty; “for	321.3613418289735
though I hear your words, I declare I do not understand them.”	295.16973977978984
“Then you have no religion at all; I like that best,” replied Lord de	269.2688479042341
Winter, laughing.	291.1992510988224
“Certainly that is most in accord with your own principles,” replied	264.4787313516876
Milady, frigidly.	331.9857027890155
“Oh, I confess it is all the same to me.”	270.0337354482871
“Oh, you need not avow this religious indifference, my Lord; your	208.50295057948216
debaucheries and crimes would vouch for it.”	324.68289849493647
“What, you talk of debaucheries, Madame Messalina, Lady Macbeth! Either	272.4124053599397
I misunderstand you or you are very shameless!”	223.6673444465805
“You only speak thus because you are overheard,” coolly replied Milady;	354.91563810210835
“and you wish to interest your jailers and your hangmen against me.”	249.26697247942016
“My jailers and my hangmen! Heyday, madame! you are taking a poetical	187.59278492286185
tone, and the comedy of yesterday turns to a tragedy this evening. As	365.22399333501426
to the rest, in eight days you will be where you ought to be, and my	310.10530549916757
task will be completed.”	226.48773654355603
“Infamous task! impious task!” cried Milady, with the exultation of a	273.4688022767387
victim who provokes his judge.	322.0917551762221
“My word,” said de Winter, rising, “I think the hussy is going mad!	222.66044783930877
Come, come, calm yourself, Madame Puritan, or I’ll remove you to a	242.75552850966287
dungeon. It’s my Spanish wine that has got into your head, is it not?	228.148330801508
But never mind; that sort of intoxication is not dangerous, and will	213.39500554648194
have no bad effects.”	255.11436399442277
And Lord de Winter retired swearing, which at that period was a very	319.0721706059852
knightly habit.	177.366934757704
Felton was indeed behind the door, and had not lost one word of this	179.12042995113944
scene. Milady had guessed aright.	177.5542757669816
“Yes, go, go!” said she to her brother; “the effects _are_ drawing	337.1309121385475
near, on the contrary; but you, weak fool, will not see them until it	317.6882732143289
is too late to shun them.”	202.36930921358044
Silence was re-established. Two hours passed away. Milady’s supper was	281.8388769285778
brought in, and she was found deeply engaged in saying her prayers	325.3626443680885
aloud—prayers which she had learned of an old servant of her second	264.13465930029685
husband, a most austere Puritan. She appeared to be in ecstasy, and did	337.7470928367608
not pay the least attention to what was going on around her. Felton	305.3515097436566
made a sign that she should not be disturbed; and when all was	321.3611902615753
arranged, he went out quietly with the soldiers.	287.6878786900668
Milady knew she might be watched, so she continued her prayers to the	329.69395710379604
end; and it appeared to her that the soldier who was on duty at her	280.78434935191626
door did not march with the same step, and seemed to listen. For the	254.97275753758328
moment she wished nothing better. She arose, came to the table, ate but	305.42681768228476
little, and drank only water.	268.54139782875745
An hour after, her table was cleared; but Milady remarked that this	243.18474697604609
time Felton did not accompany the soldiers. He feared, then, to see her	262.9760727565375
too often.	216.08313808971414
She turned toward the wall to smile—for there was in this smile such an	273.72441529492073
expression of triumph that this smile alone would have betrayed her.	281.27289004854197
She allowed, therefore, half an hour to pass away; and as at that	283.0920436556593
moment all was silence in the old castle, as nothing was heard but the	294.58225755345705
eternal murmur of the waves—that immense breaking of the ocean—with her	335.36777975541327
pure, harmonious, and powerful voice, she began the first couplet of	334.12775862709304
the psalm then in great favor with the Puritans:	170.6204740051087
“Thou leavest thy servants, Lord,	301.5276289710537
    To see if they be strong;	178.82753936098712
But soon thou dost afford	190.7863516017065
    Thy hand to lead them on.”	192.4463851151878
These verses were not excellent—very far from it; but as it is well	237.1832312933367
known, the Puritans did not pique themselves upon their poetry.	232.54765496919134
While singing, Milady listened. The soldier on guard at her door	317.6233376294068
stopped, as if he had been changed into stone. Milady was then able to	247.53654509899195
judge of the effect she had produced.	222.38894468324023
Then she continued her singing with inexpressible fervor and feeling.	336.2779784636969
It appeared to her that the sounds spread to a distance beneath the	192.46872546258098
vaulted roofs, and carried with them a magic charm to soften the hearts	339.0853981591328
of her jailers. It however likewise appeared that the soldier on duty—a	266.8020292486398
zealous Catholic, no doubt—shook off the charm, for through the door he	312.19039662479645
called: “Hold your tongue, madame! Your song is as dismal as a ‘De	275.81142219677633
profundis’; and if besides the pleasure of being in garrison here, we	265.01301713024196
must hear such things as these, no mortal can hold out.”	202.37799795975613
“Silence!” then exclaimed another stern voice which Milady recognized	190.78868836867753
as that of Felton. “What are you meddling with, stupid? Did anybody	197.01110836686064
order you to prevent that woman from singing? No. You were told to	339.22571885108914
guard her—to fire at her if she attempted to fly. Guard her! If she	278.8329206165019
flies, kill her; but don’t exceed your orders.”	252.2507018337625
An expression of unspeakable joy lightened the countenance of Milady;	331.9244885087869
but this expression was fleeting as the reflection of lightning.	182.06378767470832
Without appearing to have heard the dialogue, of which she had not lost	302.05637702552974
a word, she began again, giving to her voice all the charm, all the	316.55575085861085
power, all the seduction the demon had bestowed upon it:	303.0022368528337
“For all my tears, my cares,	236.67677886089234
    My exile, and my chains,	303.7434483590787
I have my youth, my prayers,	288.00189804441277
    And God, who counts my pains.”	252.1149028712406
Her voice, of immense power and sublime expression, gave to the rude,	200.44767031506314
unpolished poetry of these psalms a magic and an effect which the most	167.12197716759846
exalted Puritans rarely found in the songs of their brethren, and which	192.36308720508984
they were forced to ornament with all the resources of their	180.760452830665
imagination. Felton believed he heard the singing of the angel who	177.36059039936487
consoled the three Hebrews in the furnace.	301.71785922404126
Milady continued:	263.2995965693882
“One day our doors will ope,	224.57747414718594
    With God come our desire;	328.2039882884718
And if betrays that hope,	247.14961225258818
    To death we can aspire.”	173.05681514588335
This verse, into which the terrible enchantress threw her whole soul,	260.93794840237746
completed the trouble which had seized the heart of the young officer.	269.9798732928086
He opened the door quickly; and Milady saw him appear, pale as usual,	181.18110169218286
but with his eye inflamed and almost wild.	179.7871170384953
“Why do you sing thus, and with such a voice?” said he.	249.4511051572327
“Your pardon, sir,” said Milady, with mildness. “I forgot that my songs	352.37699636222953
are out of place in this castle. I have perhaps offended you in your	359.67436540684673
creed; but it was without wishing to do so, I swear. Pardon me, then, a	179.23973797182921
fault which is perhaps great, but which certainly was involuntary.”	172.17760576181564
Milady was so beautiful at this moment, the religious ecstasy in which	268.5863704518076
she appeared to be plunged gave such an expression to her countenance,	242.882905092118
that Felton was so dazzled that he fancied he beheld the angel whom he	214.8928997222914
had only just before heard.	288.1896631340936
“Yes, yes,” said he; “you disturb, you agitate the people who live in	261.1626350051007
the castle.”	280.8231614570898
The poor, senseless young man was not aware of the incoherence of his	345.15566553546955
words, while Milady was reading with her lynx’s eyes the very depths of	360.2678444884791
his heart.	290.7723941966057
“I will be silent, then,” said Milady, casting down her eyes with all	228.66970086670437
the sweetness she could give to her voice, with all the resignation she	269.34176091687493
could impress upon her manner.	358.1161732945763
“No, no, madame,” said Felton, “only do not sing so loud, particularly	357.3969034861578
at night.”	303.1635579281522
And at these words Felton, feeling that he could not long maintain his	181.68063151852618
severity toward his prisoner, rushed out of the room.	180.76502330927158
“You have done right, Lieutenant,” said the soldier. “Such songs	215.43256551977998
disturb the mind; and yet we become accustomed to them, her voice is so	194.4063755866996
beautiful.”	341.6969734873024
Chapter LIV.	266.1458203401603
CAPTIVITY: THE THIRD DAY	284.218251036113
Felton had fallen; but there was still another step to be taken. He	237.85857268841633
must be retained, or rather he must be left quite alone; and Milady but	192.89649195516796
obscurely perceived the means which could lead to this result.	233.63632080100388
Still more must be done. He must be made to speak, in order that he	362.84634298079555
might be spoken to—for Milady very well knew that her greatest	327.1065249182551
seduction was in her voice, which so skillfully ran over the whole	238.19139636958272
gamut of tones from human speech to language celestial.	301.18906116877247
Yet in spite of all this seduction Milady might fail—for Felton was	208.55554454024207
forewarned, and that against the least chance. From that moment she	223.84052714287378
watched all his actions, all his words, from the simplest glance of his	219.5905385608787
eyes to his gestures—even to a breath that could be interpreted as a	174.13934568104528
sigh. In short, she studied everything, as a skillful comedian does to	324.1159395471921
whom a new part has been assigned in a line to which he is not	208.7516835169417
accustomed.	194.56435098370483
Face to face with Lord de Winter her plan of conduct was more easy. She	183.88948264121547
had laid that down the preceding evening. To remain silent and	355.9906238567414
dignified in his presence; from time to time to irritate him by	283.5723960303626
affected disdain, by a contemptuous word; to provoke him to threats and	196.93316076806195
violence which would produce a contrast with her own resignation—such	277.05576759958575
was her plan. Felton would see all; perhaps he would say nothing, but	240.50681130052288
he would see.	307.7078343427287
In the morning, Felton came as usual; but Milady allowed him to preside	283.7682198639558
over all the preparations for breakfast without addressing a word to	309.6940367485024
him. At the moment when he was about to retire, she was cheered with a	354.1321078958293
ray of hope, for she thought he was about to speak; but his lips moved	258.2756059847239
without any sound leaving his mouth, and making a powerful effort to	189.9900082856492
control himself, he sent back to his heart the words that were about to	355.2905226663682
escape from his lips, and went out. Toward midday, Lord de Winter	172.94055067019292
entered.	232.00693270209405
It was a tolerably fine winter’s day, and a ray of that pale English	312.7441524494078
sun which lights but does not warm came through the bars of her prison.	331.452910579222
Milady was looking out at the window, and pretended not to hear the	193.129309571747
door as it opened.	237.83204252066616
“Ah, ah!” said Lord de Winter, “after having played comedy, after	199.1603018855189
having played tragedy, we are now playing melancholy?”	175.2440496702455
The prisoner made no reply.	200.13484421030944
“Yes, yes,” continued Lord de Winter, “I understand. You would like	187.4078600031546
very well to be at liberty on that beach! You would like very well to	282.50997124243406
be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald-green sea; you	271.2927940731727
would like very well, either on land or on the ocean, to lay for me one	350.8654448356807
of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning.	269.21710088472554
Patience, patience! In four days’ time the shore will be beneath your	307.4491373929874
feet, the sea will be open to you—more open than will perhaps be	256.49579261946553
agreeable to you, for in four days England will be relieved of you.”	190.35550914853428
Milady folded her hands, and raising her fine eyes toward heaven,	324.17834867104705
“Lord, Lord,” said she, with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone,	246.3301357509278
“pardon this man, as I myself pardon him.”	301.63709212094136
“Yes, pray, accursed woman!” cried the baron; “your prayer is so much	299.23811944636384
the more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a	174.1241235430052
man who will never pardon you!” and he went out.	331.77013773286797
At the moment he went out a piercing glance darted through the opening	279.4609658170719
of the nearly closed door, and she perceived Felton, who drew quickly	300.65368743725804
to one side to prevent being seen by her.	290.87467966763563
Then she threw herself upon her knees, and began to pray.	212.37576129301038
“My God, my God!” said she, “thou knowest in what holy cause I suffer;	299.30845233150507
give me, then, strength to suffer.”	296.6056129726401
The door opened gently; the beautiful supplicant pretended not to hear	182.79396709804215
the noise, and in a voice broken by tears, she continued:	288.8259751761981
“God of vengeance! God of goodness! wilt thou allow the frightful	354.8574310996379
projects of this man to be accomplished?”	185.13177594508352
Then only she pretended to hear the sound of Felton’s steps, and rising	332.59274266595224
quick as thought, she blushed, as if ashamed of being surprised on her	323.96962950832193
knees.	209.93664374637189
“I do not like to disturb those who pray, madame,” said Felton,	183.27740602398268
seriously; “do not disturb yourself on my account, I beseech you.”	223.98171563574016
“How do you know I was praying, sir?” said Milady, in a voice broken by	302.65171955178187
sobs. “You were deceived, sir; I was not praying.”	330.7072857789109
“Do you think, then, madame,” replied Felton, in the same serious	177.5621431665632
voice, but with a milder tone, “do you think I assume the right of	318.54459469018303
preventing a creature from prostrating herself before her Creator? God	297.25275203112074
forbid! Besides, repentance becomes the guilty; whatever crimes they	170.48212418722576
may have committed, for me the guilty are sacred at the feet of God!”	269.45460875230935
“Guilty? I?” said Milady, with a smile which might have disarmed the	227.70629847538663
angel of the last judgment. “Guilty? Oh, my God, thou knowest whether I	304.76204832374026
am guilty! Say I am condemned, sir, if you please; but you know that	299.30085612126766
God, who loves martyrs, sometimes permits the innocent to be	307.6766513342443
condemned.”	348.8627500649851
“Were you condemned, were you innocent, were you a martyr,” replied	266.1651670189158
Felton, “the greater would be the necessity for prayer; and I myself	279.48738919301536
would aid you with my prayers.”	186.6028227491103
“Oh, you are a just man!” cried Milady, throwing herself at his feet.	190.19429459184676
“I can hold out no longer, for I fear I shall be wanting in strength at	255.33444068875286
the moment when I shall be forced to undergo the struggle, and confess	221.71773411005523
my faith. Listen, then, to the supplication of a despairing woman. You	265.95809319488535
are abused, sir; but that is not the question. I only ask you one	308.1409200453587
favor; and if you grant it me, I will bless you in this world and in	271.6259930381492
the next.”	308.8073521646886
“Speak to the master, madame,” said Felton; “happily I am neither	336.21436831072515
charged with the power of pardoning nor punishing. It is upon one	234.25522052383354
higher placed than I am that God has laid this responsibility.”	335.5457120288115
“To you—no, to you alone! Listen to me, rather than add to my	268.42576503810534
destruction, rather than add to my ignominy!”	238.7346270488964
“If you have merited this shame, madame, if you have incurred this	178.51479100356704
ignominy, you must submit to it as an offering to God.”	269.97636359804903
“What do you say? Oh, you do not understand me! When I speak of	169.79154691904085
ignominy, you think I speak of some chastisement, of imprisonment or	181.0228728473272
death. Would to heaven! Of what consequence to me is imprisonment or	341.633484272145
death?”	229.93274417667573
“It is I who no longer understand you, madame,” said Felton.	216.0489545364926
“Or, rather, who pretend not to understand me, sir!” replied the	307.7757384600512
prisoner, with a smile of incredulity.	303.55457323940044
“No, madame, on the honor of a soldier, on the faith of a Christian.”	260.48444108415663
“What, you are ignorant of Lord de Winter’s designs upon me?”	350.4178216130735
“I am.”	355.8306742179293
“Impossible; you are his confidant!”	319.90220075728143
“I never lie, madame.”	202.30971822757394
“Oh, he conceals them too little for you not to divine them.”	175.63074895059611
“I seek to divine nothing, madame; I wait till I am confided in, and	263.1017032950757
apart from that which Lord de Winter has said to me before you, he has	216.4910246200894
confided nothing to me.”	332.32714547637636
“Why, then,” cried Milady, with an incredible tone of truthfulness,	171.6898380826022
“you are not his accomplice; you do not know that he destines me to a	249.0106263281782
disgrace which all the punishments of the world cannot equal in	216.59754151562402
horror?”	357.4520773055833
“You are deceived, madame,” said Felton, blushing; “Lord de Winter is	298.0176517769861
not capable of such a crime.”	166.19180241975937
“Good,” said Milady to herself; “without thinking what it is, he calls	183.8942115758519
it a crime!” Then aloud, “The friend of that wretch is capable of	280.3928413295825
everything.”	333.4126569459068
“Whom do you call _that wretch?_” asked Felton.	172.76512364618213
“Are there, then, in England two men to whom such an epithet can be	167.10222370790848
applied?”	210.77095180995403
“You mean George Villiers?” asked Felton, whose looks became excited.	363.5121704207131
“Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles call Duke of Buckingham,” replied	287.238425435439
Milady. “I could not have thought that there was an Englishman in all	285.20202575933155
England who would have required so long an explanation to make him	281.81603741092965
understand of whom I was speaking.”	341.19159046370544
“The hand of the Lord is stretched over him,” said Felton; “he will not	254.37441853028506
escape the chastisement he deserves.”	172.75935443275966
Felton only expressed, with regard to the duke, the feeling of	229.00212913896254
execration which all the English had declared toward him whom the	211.550612623983
Catholics themselves called the extortioner, the pillager, the	194.0098804904328
debauchee, and whom the Puritans styled simply Satan.	206.91591630429852
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Milady; “when I supplicate thee to pour	207.69374413519517
upon this man the chastisement which is his due, thou knowest it is not	344.51508100517947
my own vengeance I pursue, but the deliverance of a whole nation that I	285.40176723786135
implore!”	208.56718978752977
“Do you know him, then?” asked Felton.	219.79097524560146
“At length he interrogates me!” said Milady to herself, at the height	242.96353909396782
of joy at having obtained so quickly such a great result. “Oh, know	223.82533632094885
him? Yes, yes! to my misfortune, to my eternal misfortune!” and Milady	260.42547203041534
twisted her arms as if in a paroxysm of grief.	228.083645537907
Felton no doubt felt within himself that his strength was abandoning	292.5969979546824
him, and he made several steps toward the door; but the prisoner, whose	336.0233283080378
eye never left him, sprang in pursuit of him and stopped him.	279.65526263588043
“Sir,” cried she, “be kind, be clement, listen to my prayer! That	268.7868740734258
knife, which the fatal prudence of the baron deprived me of, because he	166.76879781682518
knows the use I would make of it! Oh, hear me to the end! that knife,	172.8579939840501
give it to me for a minute only, for mercy’s, for pity’s sake! I will	356.733186679647
embrace your knees! You shall shut the door that you may be certain I	270.34551087795836
contemplate no injury to you! My God! to you—the only just, good, and	190.115604110589
compassionate being I have met with! To you—my preserver, perhaps! One	198.81067453933395
minute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it	346.26592005732476
to you through the grating of the door. Only one minute, Mr. Felton,	241.16307491164633
and you will have saved my honor!”	291.94448220414995
“To kill yourself?” cried Felton, with terror, forgetting to withdraw	306.1091813912111
his hands from the hands of the prisoner, “to kill yourself?”	171.25021952587602
“I have told, sir,” murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing	248.30265596164878
herself to sink overpowered to the ground; “I have told my secret! He	201.70879293405545
knows all! My God, I am lost!”	259.3951158290464
Felton remained standing, motionless and undecided.	247.98768142189863
“He still doubts,” thought Milady; “I have not been earnest enough.”	217.74245466823174
Someone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord	229.77288202864835
de Winter.	360.9002709541101
Felton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door.	217.13684067278757
Milady sprang toward him. “Oh, not a word,” said she in a concentrated	179.88770038034244
voice, “not a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am	234.0054599908633
lost, and it would be you—you—”	311.9124778601421
Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard,	264.98990718675793
applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to	352.5212992021834
Felton’s mouth.	359.9636791766519
Felton gently repulsed Milady, and she sank into a chair.	258.2229310819781
Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard	240.2368783958398
the noise of his footsteps soon die away.	357.11969695295164
Felton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and	241.75845602154055
listening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a	303.41945896367105
man awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment.	225.20971054072837
“Ah!” said Milady, listening in her turn to the noise of Felton’s	302.0492223089399
steps, which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de	365.65444744249055
Winter; “at length you are mine!”	200.6742356087904
Then her brow darkened. “If he tells the baron,” said she, “I am	303.2592454375956
lost—for the baron, who knows very well that I shall not kill myself,	235.77537042290612
will place me before him with a knife in my hand, and he will discover	254.06933316590926
that all this despair is but acted.”	363.230307235381
She placed herself before the glass, and regarded herself attentively;	245.05373606609749
never had she appeared more beautiful.	347.28941905718364
“Oh, yes,” said she, smiling, “but we won’t tell him!”	240.16095671228354
In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper.	349.18793398102827
“Sir,” said Milady, “is your presence an indispensable accessory of my	285.4480858010492
captivity? Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your	357.0504415863942
visits cause me?”	232.48140042240692
“How, dear sister!” said Lord de Winter. “Did not you sentimentally	173.30396516890724
inform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that	169.96869312647402
you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease,	257.533515554386
an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation	335.4764360829028
that you had risked everything for it—seasickness, tempest, captivity?	248.1966585347027
Well, here I am; be satisfied. Besides, this time, my visit has a	225.3832290921736
motive.”	172.90411878994576
Milady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her	255.45432305204736
life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful	199.7350146630598
emotions, felt her heart beat so violently.	292.7075324194335
She was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and	270.12461622566866
sat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he	296.43842003584996
unfolded it slowly.	183.29740695530683
“Here,” said he, “I want to show you the kind of passport which I have	356.97440654878346
drawn up, and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in	338.0926356219495
the life I consent to leave you.”	301.18264814416216
Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: “‘Order to	190.3224184210735
conduct—’ The name is blank,” interrupted Lord de Winter. “If you have	305.2126439862167
any preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a	325.8564762344988
thousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes. I	211.85962860996347
will begin again, then:	190.66573259856705
“‘Order to conduct to—the person named Charlotte Backson, branded by	203.44463226500716
the justice of the kingdom of France, but liberated after chastisement.	312.6075096787682
She is to dwell in this place without ever going more than three	232.5652097700133
leagues from it. In case of any attempt to escape, the penalty of death	253.96073786708087
is to be applied. She will receive five shillings per day for lodging	248.8919115309552
and food’”.	274.37878420021497
“That order does not concern me,” replied Milady, coldly, “since it	202.91338876914529
bears another name than mine.”	204.81851739916922
“A name? Have you a name, then?”	285.6726196930354
“I bear that of your brother.”	167.89727266190226
“Ay, but you are mistaken. My brother is only your second husband; and	322.59934779565924
your first is still living. Tell me his name, and I will put it in the	274.005502609754
place of the name of Charlotte Backson. No? You will not? You are	299.65026490249534
silent? Well, then you must be registered as Charlotte Backson.”	300.77984873288443
Milady remained silent; only this time it was no longer from	242.20216709449596
affectation, but from terror. She believed the order ready for	213.41936024487399
execution. She thought that Lord de Winter had hastened her departure;	211.23111162543026
she thought she was condemned to set off that very evening. Everything	239.26133590079607
in her mind was lost for an instant; when all at once she perceived	331.01489782890087
that no signature was attached to the order. The joy she felt at this	272.23399725778654
discovery was so great she could not conceal it.	323.93281874442323
“Yes, yes,” said Lord de Winter, who perceived what was passing in her	202.79672663617293
mind; “yes, you look for the signature, and you say to yourself: ‘All	266.7822448415552
is not lost, for that order is not signed. It is only shown to me to	350.37446633087995
terrify me, that’s all.’ You are mistaken. Tomorrow this order will be	226.38763871520655
sent to the Duke of Buckingham. The day after tomorrow it will return	334.7196808785222
signed by his hand and marked with his seal; and four-and-twenty hours	237.06475194892482
afterward I will answer for its being carried into execution. Adieu,	228.94199225103762
madame. That is all I had to say to you.”	208.0122675978384
“And I reply to you, sir, that this abuse of power, this exile under a	329.13434856922856
fictitious name, are infamous!”	237.12234165447111
“Would you like better to be hanged in your true name, Milady? You know	222.54383063925604
that the English laws are inexorable on the abuse of marriage. Speak	238.55186706136823
freely. Although my name, or rather that of my brother, would be mixed	343.21072511253885
up with the affair, I will risk the scandal of a public trial to make	209.31045984145837
myself certain of getting rid of you.”	218.8743467375873
Milady made no reply, but became as pale as a corpse.	341.9496239164046
“Oh, I see you prefer peregrination. That’s well madame; and there is	302.91646402112997
an old proverb that says, ‘Traveling trains youth.’ My faith! you are	197.82586171170988
not wrong after all, and life is sweet. That’s the reason why I take	360.59277142110255
such care you shall not deprive me of mine. There only remains, then,	326.47679388166847
the question of the five shillings to be settled. You think me rather	265.47148464673876
parsimonious, don’t you? That’s because I don’t care to leave you the	322.77456892633415
means of corrupting your jailers. Besides, you will always have your	311.97454608746693
charms left to seduce them with. Employ them, if your check with regard	330.1096514056098
to Felton has not disgusted you with attempts of that kind.”	171.37052229151266
“Felton has not told him,” said Milady to herself. “Nothing is lost,	308.2921156532045
then.”	179.16996997813948
“And now, madame, till I see you again! Tomorrow I will come and	362.22963448022415
announce to you the departure of my messenger.”	359.2258360910266
Lord de Winter rose, saluted her ironically, and went out.	251.9861247583603
Milady breathed again. She had still four days before her. Four days	193.02821482696544
would quite suffice to complete the seduction of Felton.	270.2825885382815
A terrible idea, however, rushed into her mind. She thought that Lord	319.18225420140504
de Winter would perhaps send Felton himself to get the order signed by	254.1299653809798
the Duke of Buckingham. In that case Felton would escape her—for in	189.54280582235043
order to secure success, the magic of a continuous seduction was	288.3243377494722
necessary. Nevertheless, as we have said, one circumstance reassured	297.4198706645063
her. Felton had not spoken.	255.21538970747338
As she would not appear to be agitated by the threats of Lord de	295.4130540917404
Winter, she placed herself at the table and ate.	236.5928781546889
Then, as she had done the evening before, she fell on her knees and	269.2528496926443
repeated her prayers aloud. As on the evening before, the soldier	259.85530924752345
stopped his march to listen to her.	325.82718429254317
Soon after she heard lighter steps than those of the sentinel, which	326.2000368817619
came from the end of the corridor and stopped before her door.	249.64956568941972
“It is he,” said she. And she began the same religious chant which had	173.9608770728455
so strongly excited Felton the evening before.	191.28572467997165
But although her voice—sweet, full, and sonorous—vibrated as	341.6718535018869
harmoniously and as affectingly as ever, the door remained shut. It	246.63999276049833
appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she	300.64342572854883
darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw	276.48860606237565
the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But	322.32340500378945
whether this was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient	283.1998590018909
self-command not to enter.	266.0944912953878
However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song,	245.53379397174086
Milady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had	197.91887049447436
heard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret.	295.6615210656661
Chapter LV.	276.44590342555114
CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY	248.33223760237388
The next day, when Felton entered Milady’s apartment he found her	240.15736842456917
standing, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by	346.7247003462947
means of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope one	338.73336004770374
with another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in	233.24593713602314
entering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal	264.2608609144828
behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand.	241.94093511950388
The young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want	248.66198462339526
of sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless,	285.72448712136304
his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever.	197.0241117304195
He advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an	226.87974937728356
end of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she	300.02012301930955
allowed to be seen, “What is this, madame?” he asked coldly.	186.3323911663726
“That? Nothing,” said Milady, smiling with that painful expression	222.89284801435605
which she knew so well how to give to her smile. “Ennui is the mortal	183.6870368288752
enemy of prisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that	258.65105199836137
rope.”	349.6011977488679
Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment	328.6439148040671
before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she	279.2616685512949
was now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw,	288.60058335871855
fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons.	268.95235504086753
He started, and the prisoner saw that start—for though her eyes were	237.94005430158805
cast down, nothing escaped her.	319.1288549357257
“What were you doing on that armchair?” asked he.	320.8495653575129
“Of what consequence?” replied Milady.	267.7994933295781
“But,” replied Felton, “I wish to know.”	212.85510536050828
“Do not question me,” said the prisoner; “you know that we who are true	352.9501257263544
Christians are forbidden to lie.”	198.7854557110603
“Well, then,” said Felton, “I will tell you what you were doing, or	251.9496106260296
rather what you meant to do; you were going to complete the fatal	243.34669840194897
project you cherish in your mind. Remember, madame, if our God forbids	244.36406314615664
falsehood, he much more severely condemns suicide.”	255.61431527330785
“When God sees one of his creatures persecuted unjustly, placed between	186.54857553125632
suicide and dishonor, believe me, sir,” replied Milady, in a tone of	196.9144673664954
deep conviction, “God pardons suicide, for then suicide becomes	278.23472682496003
martyrdom.”	358.6429935579654
“You say either too much or too little; speak, madame. In the name of	340.75246915064895
heaven, explain yourself.”	178.85413411312558
“That I may relate my misfortunes for you to treat them as fables; that	237.7241195690503
I may tell you my projects for you to go and betray them to my	344.6277314354243
persecutor? No, sir. Besides, of what importance to you is the life or	279.2767576583792
death of a condemned wretch? You are only responsible for my body, is	177.7215337071752
it not so? And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as	247.89630691939385
mine, they will require no more of you; nay, perhaps you will even have	214.47945542890693
a double reward.”	221.27113819006698
“I, madame, I?” cried Felton. “You suppose that I would ever accept the	357.90390081638657
price of your life? Oh, you cannot believe what you say!”	281.47176627426325
“Let me act as I please, Felton, let me act as I please,” said Milady,	364.26275537539004
elated. “Every soldier must be ambitious, must he not? You are a	278.4387645235584
lieutenant? Well, you will follow me to the grave with the rank of	357.1518809795029
captain.”	324.1919049191249
“What have I, then, done to you,” said Felton, much agitated, “that you	304.4578853605236
should load me with such a responsibility before God and before men? In	195.87636050581432
a few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will	247.7489374178274
then no longer be under my care, and,” added he, with a sigh, “then you	259.06309578816365
can do what you will with it.”	272.0262065641592
“So,” cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a	188.66203991393036
holy indignation, “you, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you	210.657037021048
ask but one thing—and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed,	243.4939503691014
by my death!”	287.8793044366401
“It is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.”	326.9612338670206
“But do you understand the mission you are fulfilling? Cruel enough, if	245.7919946107914
I am guilty; but what name can you give it, what name will the Lord	245.48902936750505
give it, if I am innocent?”	234.57215357454663
“I am a soldier, madame, and fulfill the orders I have received.”	278.8517201584185
“Do you believe, then, that at the day of the Last Judgment God will	258.4001289329552
separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges? You are not willing	316.4088791893299
that I should kill my body, and you make yourself the agent of him who	211.57890967159236
would kill my soul.”	167.7436551604967
“But I repeat it again to you,” replied Felton, in great emotion, “no	307.9341882691051
danger threatens you; I will answer for Lord de Winter as for myself.”	245.5588045961467
“Dunce,” cried Milady, “dunce! who dares to answer for another man,	288.93815117924197
when the wisest, when those most after God’s own heart, hesitate to	246.44182055484515
answer for themselves, and who ranges himself on the side of the	239.606891435206
strongest and the most fortunate, to crush the weakest and the most	323.5661095479305
unfortunate.”	266.144106260222
“Impossible, madame, impossible,” murmured Felton, who felt to the	181.4180533867951
bottom of his heart the justness of this argument. “A prisoner, you	172.72634416026153
will not recover your liberty through me; living, you will not lose	212.1744583577129
your life through me.”	288.7684215642714
“Yes,” cried Milady, “but I shall lose that which is much dearer to me	347.6255971872457
than life, I shall lose my honor, Felton; and it is you, you whom I	264.35315989803235
make responsible, before God and before men, for my shame and my	170.50226508608074
infamy.”	266.5286483635149
This time Felton, immovable as he was, or appeared to be, could not	273.02112111479096
resist the secret influence which had already taken possession of him.	329.8914864223011
To see this woman, so beautiful, fair as the brightest vision, to see	338.53117877440235
her by turns overcome with grief and threatening; to resist at once the	355.2312965418544
ascendancy of grief and beauty—it was too much for a visionary; it was	243.47614532055374
too much for a brain weakened by the ardent dreams of an ecstatic	329.9859535057658
faith; it was too much for a heart furrowed by the love of heaven that	188.6513501242963
burns, by the hatred of men that devours.	197.73826874534325
Milady saw the trouble. She felt by intuition the flame of the opposing	256.30128756335193
passions which burned with the blood in the veins of the young fanatic.	309.67499644460736
As a skillful general, seeing the enemy ready to surrender, marches	276.8933737602242
toward him with a cry of victory, she rose, beautiful as an antique	216.1302066699736
priestess, inspired like a Christian virgin, her arms extended, her	239.6146220924435
throat uncovered, her hair disheveled, holding with one hand her robe	307.36226192273614
modestly drawn over her breast, her look illumined by that fire which	266.61752548821687
had already created such disorder in the veins of the young Puritan,	314.8622079473722
and went toward him, crying out with a vehement air, and in her	273.1098911208796
melodious voice, to which on this occasion she communicated a terrible	195.99030965311377
energy:	186.1413595694801
“Let this victim to Baal be sent,	187.52318922346015
    To the lions the martyr be thrown!	263.649526410922
Thy God shall teach thee to repent!	339.4396825082605
    From th’ abyss he’ll give ear to my moan.”	281.421278983669
Felton stood before this strange apparition like one petrified.	354.569142690246
“Who art thou? Who art thou?” cried he, clasping his hands. “Art thou a	215.61187362658399
messenger from God; art thou a minister from hell; art thou an angel or	352.18046774919844
a demon; callest thou thyself Eloa or Astarte?”	245.35316143102213
“Do you not know me, Felton? I am neither an angel nor a demon; I am a	320.12129126860225
daughter of earth, I am a sister of thy faith, that is all.”	232.9379974981279
“Yes, yes!” said Felton, “I doubted, but now I believe.”	277.7329569236081
“You believe, and still you are an accomplice of that child of Belial	190.33795789173686
who is called Lord de Winter! You believe, and yet you leave me in the	357.3327727591168
hands of mine enemies, of the enemy of England, of the enemy of God!	345.11465632613204
You believe, and yet you deliver me up to him who fills and defiles the	348.1063953358179
world with his heresies and debaucheries—to that infamous Sardanapalus	307.40727229369463
whom the blind call the Duke of Buckingham, and whom believers name	245.40372649860984
Antichrist!”	219.1376639499045
“I deliver you up to Buckingham? I? what mean you by that?”	362.3991091656535
“They have eyes,” cried Milady, “but they see not; ears have they, but	178.64309396034497
they hear not.”	318.31935320843326
“Yes, yes!” said Felton, passing his hands over his brow, covered with	225.00931614066062
sweat, as if to remove his last doubt. “Yes, I recognize the voice	191.5132683496703
which speaks to me in my dreams; yes, I recognize the features of the	345.43726429181476
angel who appears to me every night, crying to my soul, which cannot	251.41498422595112
sleep: ‘Strike, save England, save thyself—for thou wilt die without	308.04680070976264
having appeased God!’ Speak, speak!” cried Felton, “I can understand	302.33997927199425
you now.”	301.1371778024396
A flash of terrible joy, but rapid as thought, gleamed from the eyes of	203.3610224333281
Milady.	355.8295999765504
However fugitive this homicide flash, Felton saw it, and started as if	226.00187371872744
its light had revealed the abysses of this woman’s heart. He recalled,	326.2559681623632
all at once, the warnings of Lord de Winter, the seductions of Milady,	364.54453710614473
her first attempts after her arrival. He drew back a step, and hung	326.3377617740128
down his head, without, however, ceasing to look at her, as if,	202.5625427388114
fascinated by this strange creature, he could not detach his eyes from	190.27296208326575
her eyes.	207.6910718287726
Milady was not a woman to misunderstand the meaning of this hesitation.	355.3626583903635
Under her apparent emotions her icy coolness never abandoned her.	343.6370210296109
Before Felton replied, and before she should be forced to resume this	339.51477220901336
conversation, so difficult to be sustained in the same exalted tone,	247.71615254522982
she let her hands fall; and as if the weakness of the woman overpowered	214.71298578684468
the enthusiasm of the inspired fanatic, she said: “But no, it is not	332.5272514227554
for me to be the Judith to deliver Bethulia from this Holofernes. The	218.77203538578465
sword of the eternal is too heavy for my arm. Allow me, then, to avoid	198.5156268415695
dishonor by death; let me take refuge in martyrdom. I do not ask you	176.95342505194103
for liberty, as a guilty one would, nor for vengeance, as would a	364.75734709730284
pagan. Let me die; that is all. I supplicate you, I implore you on my	270.66942639316403
knees—let me die, and my last sigh shall be a blessing for my	282.0672287911846
preserver.”	279.05180020135526
Hearing that voice, so sweet and suppliant, seeing that look, so timid	319.6310913143086
and downcast, Felton reproached himself. By degrees the enchantress had	185.86453628805
clothed herself with that magic adornment which she assumed and threw	311.5433353521832
aside at will; that is to say, beauty, meekness, and tears—and above	206.31803055840987
all, the irresistible attraction of mystical voluptuousness, the most	233.65396312761
devouring of all voluptuousness.	352.2218752296686
“Alas!” said Felton, “I can do but one thing, which is to pity you if	323.63188569847387
you prove to me you are a victim! But Lord de Winter makes cruel	289.4599954103442
accusations against you. You are a Christian; you are my sister in	319.51360472198445
religion. I feel myself drawn toward you—I, who have never loved anyone	212.21069217792729
but my benefactor—I who have met with nothing but traitors and impious	170.92558257137787
men. But you, madame, so beautiful in reality, you, so pure in	304.3974680686089
appearance, must have committed great iniquities for Lord de Winter to	238.2843252339095
pursue you thus.”	288.3377563898994
“They have eyes,” repeated Milady, with an accent of indescribable	280.675339442004
grief, “but they see not; ears have they, but they hear not.”	325.9066680380024
“But,” cried the young officer, “speak, then, speak!”	264.8130258003408
“Confide my shame to you,” cried Milady, with the blush of modesty upon	316.2213508559606
her countenance, “for often the crime of one becomes the shame of	352.65152478628636
another—confide my shame to you, a man, and I a woman? Oh,” continued	175.281494118236
she, placing her hand modestly over her beautiful eyes, “never!	180.32741074341112
never!—I could not!”	354.764082951927
“To me, to a brother?” said Felton.	283.54148769525574
Milady looked at him for some time with an expression which the young	270.7328620488992
man took for doubt, but which, however, was nothing but observation, or	293.01246147042644
rather the wish to fascinate.	186.24871129366102
Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands.	239.60504375011942
“Well, then,” said Milady, “I confide in my brother; I will dare to—”	309.5742262015991
At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time	206.0070821989529
the terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on	248.15973682174248
the preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again.	341.82894919543776
He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened,	300.8100845154096
and he appeared.	268.0137922332774
During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and	223.7374963297572
when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner.	317.6476554910108
The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to	217.073098033148
the young officer.	283.1913171592012
“You have been here a very long time, John,” said he. “Has this woman	292.10500637138233
been relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the	329.6037126944991
length of the conversation.”	338.9169860646671
Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the	303.52645361760904
assistance of the disconcerted Puritan.	170.01225744779526
“Ah, you fear your prisoner should escape!” said she. “Well, ask your	324.0827720276441
worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.”	291.9373356625053
“You demanded a favor?” said the baron, suspiciously.	255.78455416952028
“Yes, my Lord,” replied the young man, confused.	205.54345410845497
“And what favor, pray?” asked Lord de Winter.	334.3760587613288
“A knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door	294.8569490251898
a minute after she had received it,” replied Felton.	170.57924421904713
“There is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady	290.7199930839756
is desirous of cutting,” said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous	225.03507632480253
tone.	278.299652563577
“There is myself,” replied Milady.	172.78965115527356
“I have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,” replied Lord	245.74166314006197
de Winter. “Choose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain	365.292688778964
than the knife.”	363.68649947128006
Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the	238.11925755430224
moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand.	244.0450965980118
“You are right,” said she, “I have often thought of it.” Then she added	331.29324452407445
in a low voice, “And I will think of it again.”	214.56411487190485
Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de	199.1672008025232
Winter perceived this emotion.	331.96970530339934
“Mistrust yourself, John,” said he. “I have placed reliance upon you,	345.8615172114377
my friend. Beware! I have warned you! But be of good courage, my lad;	171.03186382655767
in three days we shall be delivered from this creature, and where I	239.92824676416421
shall send her she can harm nobody.”	172.20315462386668
“You hear him!” cried Milady, with vehemence, so that the baron might	169.13850448649146
believe she was addressing heaven, and that Felton might understand she	193.27755010167576
was addressing him.	243.81713573719486
Felton lowered his head and reflected.	250.04562526935584
The baron took the young officer by the arm, and turned his head over	254.48442221669103
his shoulder, so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out.	276.0471635507122
“Well,” said the prisoner, when the door was shut, “I am not so far	320.2510323658654
advanced as I believed. De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into	268.56624819276954
a strange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds	215.86766764467274
a man! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that cursed	305.148658711484
D’Artagnan. A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them by	214.13051691581768
clasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by	251.6494586853895
clasping his arms round them.”	193.60316927203215
Milady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would	191.4834255179549
pass away without her seeing Felton again. At last, in an hour after	223.6615601307246
the scene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low	296.7185428834472
voice at the door. Presently the door opened, and she perceived Felton.	225.5227820933822
The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open	331.0134849182366
behind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much	211.07786368373263
agitated.	168.12566225962297
“What do you want with me?” said she.	198.63616055606556
“Listen,” replied Felton, in a low voice. “I have just sent away the	313.0862047032161
sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order	301.83070767104107
to speak to you without being overheard. The baron has just related a	182.54005814418122
frightful story to me.”	262.89390658216894
Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim, and shook her head.	167.7674260607207
“Either you are a demon,” continued Felton, “or the baron—my	204.23699183476268
benefactor, my father—is a monster. I have known you four days; I have	256.2008610936297
loved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not	203.14719666158746
alarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I	214.18064681421063
will come and see you, and you shall convince me.”	225.9482730050125
“No, Felton, no, my brother,” said she; “the sacrifice is too great,	218.734460006963
and I feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with	320.3585879672206
me. My death will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence	333.2030992319728
of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the	171.35578952622942
prisoner.”	331.1771401912191
“Be silent, madame,” cried Felton, “and do not speak to me thus; I came	262.0374744388396
to entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what	262.3890308009457
you hold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.”	245.3215686438994
“I will not promise,” said Milady, “for no one has more respect for a	204.4645860024686
promise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep	246.54923988010967
it.”	294.82651652088407
“Well,” said Felton, “only promise till you have seen me again. If,	167.34794087390972
when you have seen me again, you still persist—well, then you shall be	222.67505129127835
free, and I myself will give you the weapon you desire.”	339.6223657620924
“Well,” said Milady, “for you I will wait.”	347.7786694805095
“Swear.”	343.6251087444833
“I swear it, by our God. Are you satisfied?”	237.76054419952757
“Well,” said Felton, “till tonight.”	194.36242918023464
And he darted out of the room, shut the door, and waited in the	282.4845749478176
corridor, the soldier’s half-pike in his hand, and as if he had mounted	349.0925672865993
guard in his place.	309.17805419767564
The soldier returned, and Felton gave him back his weapon.	285.05661041351243
Then, through the grating to which she had drawn near, Milady saw the	200.06078631352648
young man make a sign with delirious fervor, and depart in an apparent	355.21102542580115
transport of joy.	296.05595088224106
As for her, she returned to her place with a smile of savage contempt	355.454124078207
upon her lips, and repeated, blaspheming, that terrible name of God, by	181.41756990902607
whom she had just sworn without ever having learned to know Him.	304.6861082051697
“My God,” said she, “what a senseless fanatic! My God, it is I—I—and	264.22370732944785
this fellow who will help me to avenge myself.”	250.22167394356134
Chapter LVI.	302.85788753017175
CAPTIVITY: THE FIFTH DAY	213.85018656302768
Milady had however achieved a half-triumph, and success doubled her	317.9383262653856
forces.	355.33602069699236
It was not difficult to conquer, as she had hitherto done, men prompt	362.35910619662405
to let themselves be seduced, and whom the gallant education of a court	234.95037041670994
led quickly into her net. Milady was handsome enough not to find much	295.91517564927733
resistance on the part of the flesh, and she was sufficiently skillful	297.02976828309875
to prevail over all the obstacles of the mind.	175.1220809329513
But this time she had to contend with an unpolished nature,	208.0669588062397
concentrated and insensible by force of austerity. Religion and its	174.7287364172376
observances had made Felton a man inaccessible to ordinary seductions.	343.08813445968246
There fermented in that sublimated brain plans so vast, projects so	231.95718734569624
tumultuous, that there remained no room for any capricious or material	302.76474564144894
love—that sentiment which is fed by leisure and grows with corruption.	230.1959574973381
Milady had, then, made a breach by her false virtue in the opinion of a	231.31968461991158
man horribly prejudiced against her, and by her beauty in the heart of	326.094286229552
a man hitherto chaste and pure. In short, she had taken the measure of	213.8447333967451
motives hitherto unknown to herself, through this experiment, made upon	316.4020354723781
the most rebellious subject that nature and religion could submit to	281.5998901271173
her study.	297.4758297316683
Many a time, nevertheless, during the evening she despaired of fate and	343.3942196031128
of herself. She did not invoke God, we very well know, but she had	177.2764089912684
faith in the genius of evil—that immense sovereignty which reigns in	261.2313321826738
all the details of human life, and by which, as in the Arabian fable, a	334.40605965769083
single pomegranate seed is sufficient to reconstruct a ruined world.	232.91986885005002
Milady, being well prepared for the reception of Felton, was able to	349.35375814110375
erect her batteries for the next day. She knew she had only two days	267.41610060778004
left; that when once the order was signed by Buckingham—and Buckingham	182.02588944661127
would sign it the more readily from its bearing a false name, and he	293.44946881362114
could not, therefore, recognize the woman in question—once this order	302.0091021669397
was signed, we say, the baron would make her embark immediately, and	213.0640495266731
she knew very well that women condemned to exile employ arms much less	237.12922763679046
powerful in their seductions than the pretendedly virtuous woman whose	362.59209927998916
beauty is lighted by the sun of the world, whose style the voice of	254.45588813746102
fashion lauds, and whom a halo of aristocracy gilds with enchanting	174.98537492195774
splendors. To be a woman condemned to a painful and disgraceful	178.0621241800062
punishment is no impediment to beauty, but it is an obstacle to the	324.60949969287134
recovery of power. Like all persons of real genius, Milady knew what	357.68361736092027
suited her nature and her means. Poverty was repugnant to her;	200.29244720890387
degradation took away two-thirds of her greatness. Milady was only a	183.6129351129883
queen while among queens. The pleasure of satisfied pride was necessary	236.77906455380258
to her domination. To command inferior beings was rather a humiliation	326.36366554280943
than a pleasure for her.	292.4358551695406
She should certainly return from her exile—she did not doubt that a	256.65789366965055
single instant; but how long might this exile last? For an active,	167.46982924339213
ambitious nature, like that of Milady, days not spent in climbing are	284.0364438249116
inauspicious days. What word, then, can be found to describe the days	347.87054204317786
which they occupy in descending? To lose a year, two years, three	315.3385921768624
years, is to talk of an eternity; to return after the death or disgrace	360.315426384684
of the cardinal, perhaps; to return when D’Artagnan and his friends,	224.32704944900127
happy and triumphant, should have received from the queen the reward	318.25839065048234
they had well acquired by the services they had rendered her—these were	330.35117495174984
devouring ideas that a woman like Milady could not endure. For the	252.98051100336272
rest, the storm which raged within her doubled her strength, and she	255.90388682851275
would have burst the walls of her prison if her body had been able to	235.13822390890772
take for a single instant the proportions of her mind.	282.60112865255303
Then that which spurred her on additionally in the midst of all this	349.49910948994204
was the remembrance of the cardinal. What must the mistrustful,	282.16379234485595
restless, suspicious cardinal think of her silence—the cardinal, not	260.1821665993746
merely her only support, her only prop, her only protector at present,	315.92572123774937
but still further, the principal instrument of her future fortune and	243.8067724322344
vengeance? She knew him; she knew that at her return from a fruitless	353.62435807970047
journey it would be in vain to tell him of her imprisonment, in vain to	298.4115181339116
enlarge upon the sufferings she had undergone. The cardinal would	204.73389379414152
reply, with the sarcastic calmness of the skeptic, strong at once by	185.15588526860108
power and genius, “You should not have allowed yourself to be taken.”	226.0267545497668
Then Milady collected all her energies, murmuring in the depths of her	342.0280535759766
soul the name of Felton—the only beam of light that penetrated to her	172.24666817251182
in the hell into which she had fallen; and like a serpent which folds	277.56252836575186
and unfolds its rings to ascertain its strength, she enveloped Felton	338.09288579491
beforehand in the thousand meshes of her inventive imagination.	330.0159730389395
Time, however, passed away; the hours, one after another, seemed to	323.52463783210845
awaken the clock as they passed, and every blow of the brass hammer	332.54893390809684
resounded upon the heart of the prisoner. At nine o’clock, Lord de	167.14794797446345
Winter made his customary visit, examined the window and the bars,	287.0792491724146
sounded the floor and the walls, looked to the chimney and the doors,	325.26446186007536
without, during this long and minute examination, he or Milady	347.1531623976294
pronouncing a single word.	237.10542744563276
Doubtless both of them understood that the situation had become too	232.2045239127754
serious to lose time in useless words and aimless wrath.	249.33424730253245
“Well,” said the baron, on leaving her “you will not escape tonight!”	251.42110381145451
At ten o’clock Felton came and placed the sentinel. Milady recognized	207.58970650049733
his step. She was as well acquainted with it now as a mistress is with	214.47537598674577
that of the lover of her heart; and yet Milady at the same time	362.1238096044142
detested and despised this weak fanatic.	215.80608041121587
That was not the appointed hour. Felton did not enter.	333.17808037929024
Two hours after, as midnight sounded, the sentinel was relieved. This	185.34353356180617
time it _was_ the hour, and from this moment Milady waited with	265.58887152632724
impatience. The new sentinel commenced his walk in the corridor. At the	280.16221511697404
expiration of ten minutes Felton came.	302.3022554362834
Milady was all attention.	265.74408091514834
“Listen,” said the young man to the sentinel. “On no pretense leave the	291.8886119045722
door, for you know that last night my Lord punished a soldier for	261.23198794117155
having quit his post for an instant, although I, during his absence,	271.52796622840947
watched in his place.”	169.97901754322922
“Yes, I know it,” said the soldier.	360.9461487655568
“I recommend you therefore to keep the strictest watch. For my part I	227.89422614002993
am going to pay a second visit to this woman, who I fear entertains	250.17343559336962
sinister intentions upon her own life, and I have received orders to	339.91001759046964
watch her.”	256.73231133100063
“Good!” murmured Milady; “the austere Puritan lies.”	192.85396924650584
As to the soldier, he only smiled.	179.16566980974105
“Zounds, Lieutenant!” said he; “you are not unlucky in being charged	315.41128684671844
with such commissions, particularly if my Lord has authorized you to	348.3251783199944
look into her bed.”	278.97833105982465
Felton blushed. Under any other circumstances he would have reprimanded	186.95505388758534
the soldier for indulging in such pleasantry, but his conscience	201.72497365263794
murmured too loud for his mouth to dare speak.	291.7701242746249
“If I call, come,” said he. “If anyone comes, call me.”	218.04429697534914
“I will, Lieutenant,” said the soldier.	340.9276090312127
Felton entered Milady’s apartment. Milady arose.	340.4698147886545
“You are here!” said she.	262.6033322966731
“I promised to come,” said Felton, “and I have come.”	348.48203893658564
“You promised me something else.”	330.60887489506746
“What, my God!” said the young man, who in spite of his self-command	229.9537041959414
felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow.	228.7252058654068
“You promised to bring a knife, and to leave it with me after our	344.5075979271795
interview.”	195.3924299855342
“Say no more of that, madame,” said Felton. “There is no situation,	257.5761332027591
however terrible it may be, which can authorize a creature of God to	301.202302938495
inflict death upon himself. I have reflected, and I cannot, must not be	288.362622704206
guilty of such a sin.”	363.38715120330744
“Ah, you have reflected!” said the prisoner, sitting down in her	209.92534508223468
armchair, with a smile of disdain; “and I also have reflected.”	205.32087085834286
“Upon what?”	205.18906328450083
“That I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word.”	208.37817687399618
“Oh, my God!” murmured Felton.	343.8832637502293
“You may retire,” said Milady. “I will not talk.”	322.6220096634745
“Here is the knife,” said Felton, drawing from his pocket the weapon	245.48486951922567
which he had brought, according to his promise, but which he hesitated	168.46171460959056
to give to his prisoner.	258.928259392319
“Let me see it,” said Milady.	217.51589457419777
“For what purpose?”	256.273708980847
“Upon my honor, I will instantly return it to you. You shall place it	281.96844156850807
on that table, and you may remain between it and me.”	198.9624342504955
Felton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it	180.40976600061228
attentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.	243.86958044168705
“Well,” said she, returning the knife to the young officer, “this is	302.1646269525992
fine and good steel. You are a faithful friend, Felton.”	242.1039434470841
Felton took back the weapon, and laid it upon the table, as he had	303.92895887344935
agreed with the prisoner.	183.2305190537044
Milady followed him with her eyes, and made a gesture of satisfaction.	305.09985355501436
“Now,” said she, “listen to me.”	292.8395217256099
The request was needless. The young officer stood upright before her,	307.4301168411949
awaiting her words as if to devour them.	297.97500956325143
“Felton,” said Milady, with a solemnity full of melancholy, “imagine	171.97179965393138
that your sister, the daughter of your father, speaks to you. While yet	246.67407580285155
young, unfortunately handsome, I was dragged into a snare. I resisted.	338.6280254198265
Ambushes and violences multiplied around me, but I resisted. The	191.17568671506868
religion I serve, the God I adore, were blasphemed because I called	282.05813915233466
upon that religion and that God, but still I resisted. Then outrages	325.28212697230435
were heaped upon me, and as my soul was not subdued they wished to	201.94654983252235
defile my body forever. Finally—”	321.5113819123016
Milady stopped, and a bitter smile passed over her lips.	252.25801374636004
“Finally,” said Felton, “finally, what did they do?”	200.52577962282155
“At length, one evening my enemy resolved to paralyze the resistance he	284.00113138202425
could not conquer. One evening he mixed a powerful narcotic with my	330.52411904256985
water. Scarcely had I finished my repast, when I felt myself sink by	243.79634125287205
degrees into a strange torpor. Although I was without mistrust, a vague	351.22040277764756
fear seized me, and I tried to struggle against sleepiness. I arose. I	264.91228424980704
wished to run to the window and call for help, but my legs refused	309.02958100268165
their office. It appeared as if the ceiling sank upon my head and	273.52276232389517
crushed me with its weight. I stretched out my arms. I tried to speak.	180.3966042274875
I could only utter inarticulate sounds, and irresistible faintness came	259.0204498797497
over me. I supported myself by a chair, feeling that I was about to	277.0886972125484
fall, but this support was soon insufficient on account of my weak	224.11237550437346
arms. I fell upon one knee, then upon both. I tried to pray, but my	230.89014048277974
tongue was frozen. God doubtless neither heard nor saw me, and I sank	171.05060412408326
upon the floor a prey to a slumber which resembled death.	244.5212702934798
“Of all that passed in that sleep, or the time which glided away while	167.7018128781542
it lasted, I have no remembrance. The only thing I recollect is that I	322.60685200805193
awoke in bed in a round chamber, the furniture of which was sumptuous,	270.77655440501917
and into which light only penetrated by an opening in the ceiling. No	248.13409742819232
door gave entrance to the room. It might be called a magnificent	296.81659945349804
prison.	364.1467463744917
“It was a long time before I was able to make out what place I was in,	341.89207195855704
or to take account of the details I describe. My mind appeared to	239.47000018303265
strive in vain to shake off the heavy darkness of the sleep from which	303.62159948181215
I could not rouse myself. I had vague perceptions of space traversed,	283.91500865706894
of the rolling of a carriage, of a horrible dream in which my strength	251.37653728567574
had become exhausted; but all this was so dark and so indistinct in my	307.4853754887226
mind that these events seemed to belong to another life than mine, and	222.24063213472425
yet mixed with mine in fantastic duality.	339.237014899108
“At times the state into which I had fallen appeared so strange that I	281.2251557029171
believed myself dreaming. I arose trembling. My clothes were near me on	242.96773309758404
a chair; I neither remembered having undressed myself nor going to bed.	191.91860150804627
Then by degrees the reality broke upon me, full of chaste terrors. I	353.77555291400995
was no longer in the house where I had dwelt. As well as I could judge	270.2862423773744
by the light of the sun, the day was already two-thirds gone. It was	299.77990720203786
the evening before when I had fallen asleep; my sleep, then, must have	191.69268441613852
lasted twenty-four hours! What had taken place during this long sleep?	349.54749992082264
“I dressed myself as quickly as possible; my slow and stiff motions all	185.22529368841592
attested that the effects of the narcotic were not yet entirely	269.590555906674
dissipated. The chamber was evidently furnished for the reception of a	258.982241931236
woman; and the most finished coquette could not have formed a wish, but	333.8557232746352
on casting her eyes about the apartment, she would have found that wish	350.7566408345526
accomplished.	341.29345853428475
“Certainly I was not the first captive that had been shut up in this	340.51941634071534
splendid prison; but you may easily comprehend, Felton, that the more	181.5713724338709
superb the prison, the greater was my terror.	320.5937904360495
“Yes, it was a prison, for I tried in vain to get out of it. I sounded	312.4708972021504
all the walls, in the hopes of discovering a door, but everywhere the	254.63006833235085
walls returned a full and flat sound.	363.03423237794823
“I made the tour of the room at least twenty times, in search of an	347.78354101591276
outlet of some kind; but there was none. I sank exhausted with fatigue	251.91934437203997
and terror into an armchair.	319.4336113437124
“Meantime, night came on rapidly, and with night my terrors increased.	293.79437088518523
I did not know but I had better remain where I was seated. It appeared	179.25293947366123
that I was surrounded with unknown dangers into which I was about to	346.3940452079574
fall at every instant. Although I had eaten nothing since the evening	336.35849039715345
before, my fears prevented my feeling hunger.	298.2109141586908
“No noise from without by which I could measure the time reached me; I	364.0431695387016
only supposed it must be seven or eight o’clock in the evening, for it	281.4357143124363
was in the month of October and it was quite dark.	303.5212039296922
“All at once the noise of a door, turning on its hinges, made me start.	284.4586858538918
A globe of fire appeared above the glazed opening of the ceiling,	249.38343783489867
casting a strong light into my chamber; and I perceived with terror	280.29567491870273
that a man was standing within a few paces of me.	341.95867533554735
“A table, with two covers, bearing a supper ready prepared, stood, as	338.6573175482106
if by magic, in the middle of the apartment.	298.5994328467155
“That man was he who had pursued me during a whole year, who had vowed	290.02176601109596
my dishonor, and who, by the first words that issued from his mouth,	300.4033703935755
gave me to understand he had accomplished it the preceding night.”	210.41949744660502
“Scoundrel!” murmured Felton.	235.62809879474818
“Oh, yes, scoundrel!” cried Milady, seeing the interest which the young	237.3894716721174
officer, whose soul seemed to hang on her lips, took in this strange	192.17329697759274
recital. “Oh, yes, scoundrel! He believed, having triumphed over me in	200.84576513260103
my sleep, that all was completed. He came, hoping that I would accept	193.75692767740887
my shame, as my shame was consummated; he came to offer his fortune in	210.11991914240852
exchange for my love.	193.54744789353504
“All that the heart of a woman could contain of haughty contempt and	224.40772674732872
disdainful words, I poured out upon this man. Doubtless he was	185.59511092719669
accustomed to such reproaches, for he listened to me calm and smiling,	334.26375507745956
with his arms crossed over his breast. Then, when he thought I had said	358.7221692910782
all, he advanced toward me; I sprang toward the table, I seized a	261.3950834719792
knife, I placed it to my breast.	340.8754794978489
“Take one step more,” said I, “and in addition to my dishonor, you	200.7221926696976
shall have my death to reproach yourself with.”	273.203311485021
“There was, no doubt, in my look, my voice, my whole person, that	353.13368583340355
sincerity of gesture, of attitude, of accent, which carries conviction	193.91323069675255
to the most perverse minds, for he paused.	172.23211633700384
“‘Your death?’ said he; ‘oh, no, you are too charming a mistress to	240.36158024279712
allow me to consent to lose you thus, after I have had the happiness to	203.0347307125278
possess you only a single time. Adieu, my charmer; I will wait to pay	207.83210753802894
you my next visit till you are in a better humor.’	365.7514370219958
“At these words he blew a whistle; the globe of fire which lighted the	344.3830315561836
room reascended and disappeared. I found myself again in complete	365.5115251167123
darkness. The same noise of a door opening and shutting was repeated	325.19691729948386
the instant afterward; the flaming globe descended afresh, and I was	213.9507725806389
completely alone.	310.6863293489255
“This moment was frightful; if I had any doubts as to my misfortune,	282.16695120005136
these doubts had vanished in an overwhelming reality. I was in the	365.53081574813245
power of a man whom I not only detested, but despised—of a man capable	267.07690638804485
of anything, and who had already given me a fatal proof of what he was	205.4675565417893
able to do.”	208.0945647820886
“But who, then, was this man?” asked Felton.	319.7946255532735
“I passed the night on a chair, starting at the least noise, for toward	223.5167581444361
midnight the lamp went out, and I was again in darkness. But the night	255.80589574350472
passed away without any fresh attempt on the part of my persecutor. Day	182.3843844327056
came; the table had disappeared, only I had still the knife in my hand.	183.02787499289752
“This knife was my only hope.	286.7388204917603
“I was worn out with fatigue. Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes; I had not	316.42085528445386
dared to sleep a single instant. The light of day reassured me; I went	194.2573471993862
and threw myself on the bed, without parting with the emancipating	244.2407525048476
knife, which I concealed under my pillow.	209.55561986550688
“When I awoke, a fresh meal was served.	167.42663270952445
“This time, in spite of my terrors, in spite of my agony, I began to	196.62615077446526
feel a devouring hunger. It was forty-eight hours since I had taken any	251.39323556700992
nourishment. I ate some bread and some fruit; then, remembering the	224.89102132815856
narcotic mixed with the water I had drunk, I would not touch that which	302.22127787879805
was placed on the table, but filled my glass at a marble fountain fixed	190.0535347591029
in the wall over my dressing table.	203.36092337108713
“And yet, notwithstanding these precautions, I remained for some time	250.32613664508716
in a terrible agitation of mind. But my fears were this time	266.1636409953519
ill-founded; I passed the day without experiencing anything of the kind	276.55787624340394
I dreaded.	217.23243653837775
“I took the precaution to half empty the _carafe_, in order that my	341.9049559779362
suspicions might not be noticed.	207.39417210666937
“The evening came on, and with it darkness; but however profound was	287.540442317166
this darkness, my eyes began to accustom themselves to it. I saw, amid	324.2219921772368
the shadows, the table sink through the floor; a quarter of an hour	176.1569803566318
later it reappeared, bearing my supper. In an instant, thanks to the	353.09965081183395
lamp, my chamber was once more lighted.	192.4506440737341
“I was determined to eat only such things as could not possibly have	361.60693979592384
anything soporific introduced into them. Two eggs and some fruit	169.43879834495868
composed my repast; then I drew another glass of water from my	300.50989876739436
protecting fountain, and drank it.	326.25194786461384
“At the first swallow, it appeared to me not to have the same taste as	293.5298106889828
in the morning. Suspicion instantly seized me. I paused, but I had	178.52594014165388
already drunk half a glass.	296.47960364841333
“I threw the rest away with horror, and waited, with the dew of fear	356.89695682762795
upon my brow.	198.11263568148684
“No doubt some invisible witness had seen me draw the water from that	189.62874278474087
fountain, and had taken advantage of my confidence in it, the better to	345.47798061462237
assure my ruin, so coolly resolved upon, so cruelly pursued.	321.16893632965116
“Half an hour had not passed when the same symptoms began to appear;	287.0293641239456
but as I had only drunk half a glass of the water, I contended longer,	295.8094716549059
and instead of falling entirely asleep, I sank into a state of	257.6177581387781
drowsiness which left me a perception of what was passing around me,	323.27499807179663
while depriving me of the strength either to defend myself or to fly.	350.1257496434305
“I dragged myself toward the bed, to seek the only defense I had	337.2445012306952
left—my saving knife; but I could not reach the bolster. I sank on my	340.7302432926982
knees, my hands clasped round one of the bedposts; then I felt that I	241.2738865769463
was lost.”	289.20880270667976
Felton became frightfully pale, and a convulsive tremor crept through	175.2611276884764
his whole body.	338.3919647926122
“And what was most frightful,” continued Milady, her voice altered, as	346.88570264721585
if she still experienced the same agony as at that awful minute, “was	295.1402262145085
that at this time I retained a consciousness of the danger that	347.23024050392394
threatened me; was that my soul, if I may say so, waked in my sleeping	206.16390411902276
body; was that I saw, that I heard. It is true that all was like a	236.65053961429072
dream, but it was not the less frightful.	352.2918987213051
“I saw the lamp ascend, and leave me in darkness; then I heard the	311.17436506596016
well-known creaking of the door although I had heard that door open but	185.20269887460648
twice.	329.42963896682716
“I felt instinctively that someone approached me; it is said that the	228.81389893990456
doomed wretch in the deserts of America thus feels the approach of the	279.4817950905899
serpent.	302.3053439928974
“I wished to make an effort; I attempted to cry out. By an incredible	323.61036675334674
effort of will I even raised myself up, but only to sink down again	205.6981210059846
immediately, and to fall into the arms of my persecutor.”	238.1379177112167
“Tell me who this man was!” cried the young officer.	263.34812514856975
Milady saw at a single glance all the painful feelings she inspired in	334.67494297261317
Felton by dwelling on every detail of her recital; but she would not	172.50612224439683
spare him a single pang. The more profoundly she wounded his heart, the	235.2291678133125
more certainly he would avenge her. She continued, then, as if she had	183.23724595413194
not heard his exclamation, or as if she thought the moment was not yet	168.75544507754398
come to reply to it.	178.11632165544077
“Only this time it was no longer an inert body, without feeling, that	186.36326615951768
the villain had to deal with. I have told you that without being able	352.96819280373256
to regain the complete exercise of my faculties, I retained the sense	344.3536846797077
of my danger. I struggled, then, with all my strength, and doubtless	313.93060638554635
opposed, weak as I was, a long resistance, for I heard him cry out,	230.06059081655962
‘These miserable Puritans! I knew very well that they tired out their	263.59104250018635
executioners, but I did not believe them so strong against their	229.26403524543116
lovers!’	249.11582509789747
“Alas! this desperate resistance could not last long. I felt my	303.23692651251355
strength fail, and this time it was not my sleep that enabled the	265.4920374089679
coward to prevail, but my swoon.”	291.2112348012839
Felton listened without uttering any word or sound, except an inward	273.8130836238647
expression of agony. The sweat streamed down his marble forehead, and	239.19534141946107
his hand, under his coat, tore his breast.	217.25252091196487
“My first impulse, on coming to myself, was to feel under my pillow for	290.9124052106824
the knife I had not been able to reach; if it had not been useful for	331.9938962723639
defense, it might at least serve for expiation.	273.76543454346483
“But on taking this knife, Felton, a terrible idea occurred to me. I	177.76117790577766
have sworn to tell you all, and I will tell you all. I have promised	289.06367780995157
you the truth; I will tell it, were it to destroy me.”	349.2285786102098
“The idea came into your mind to avenge yourself on this man, did it	231.33566357836074
not?” cried Felton.	234.15339581202355
“Yes,” said Milady. “The idea was not that of a Christian, I knew; but	300.02348841373845
without doubt, that eternal enemy of our souls, that lion roaring	352.0638168033716
constantly around us, breathed it into my mind. In short, what shall I	357.07839356282176
say to you, Felton?” continued Milady, in the tone of a woman accusing	231.07967925537235
herself of a crime. “This idea occurred to me, and did not leave me; it	194.52383029832276
is of this homicidal thought that I now bear the punishment.”	240.5503913182414
“Continue, continue!” said Felton; “I am eager to see you attain your	242.4674893426698
vengeance!”	205.3623610521004
“Oh, I resolved that it should take place as soon as possible. I had no	191.32242460365913
doubt he would return the following night. During the day I had nothing	360.78009425692545
to fear.	307.6511002137049
“When the hour of breakfast came, therefore, I did not hesitate to eat	349.5606420034574
and drink. I had determined to make believe sup, but to eat nothing. I	280.6167808863319
was forced, then, to combat the fast of the evening with the	201.41975782163843
nourishment of the morning.	290.71844146704166
“Only I concealed a glass of water, which remained after my breakfast,	336.48341982530457
thirst having been the chief of my sufferings when I remained	264.62683232246866
forty-eight hours without eating or drinking.	265.32742798111923
“The day passed away without having any other influence on me than to	221.14284710507673
strengthen the resolution I had formed; only I took care that my face	339.0248159719341
should not betray the thoughts of my heart, for I had no doubt I was	315.8365441779319
watched. Several times, even, I felt a smile on my lips. Felton, I dare	214.24092749881248
not tell you at what idea I smiled; you would hold me in horror—”	171.62019259717272
“Go on! go on!” said Felton; “you see plainly that I listen, and that I	176.85576902147136
am anxious to know the end.”	174.35384788750116
“Evening came; the ordinary events took place. During the darkness, as	333.8824280774784
before, my supper was brought. Then the lamp was lighted, and I sat	252.59858456501328
down to table. I only ate some fruit. I pretended to pour out water	294.36165712361395
from the jug, but I only drank that which I had saved in my glass. The	314.14880845875234
substitution was made so carefully that my spies, if I had any, could	344.3491298703009
have no suspicion of it.	255.12023853656433
“After supper I exhibited the same marks of languor as on the preceding	290.71829278216705
evening; but this time, as I yielded to fatigue, or as if I had become	184.48783576858924
familiarized with danger, I dragged myself toward my bed, let my robe	264.665674568482
fall, and lay down.	222.3351513994461
“I found my knife where I had placed it, under my pillow, and while	269.3973606818756
feigning to sleep, my hand grasped the handle of it convulsively.	231.86018560680685
“Two hours passed away without anything fresh happening. Oh, my God!	281.2502031714182
who could have said so the evening before? I began to fear that he	174.8241653045652
would not come.	240.82104594629567
“At length I saw the lamp rise softly, and disappear in the depths of	177.33358196759622
the ceiling; my chamber was filled with darkness and obscurity, but I	315.51544931670816
made a strong effort to penetrate this darkness and obscurity.	183.66917396796146
“Nearly ten minutes passed; I heard no other noise but the beating of	210.06740563713439
my own heart. I implored heaven that he might come.	347.8182965784516
“At length I heard the well-known noise of the door, which opened and	205.72487574303761
shut; I heard, notwithstanding the thickness of the carpet, a step	352.94903439179245
which made the floor creak; I saw, notwithstanding the darkness, a	194.55978810753876
shadow which approached my bed.”	188.4866214018628
“Haste! haste!” said Felton; “do you not see that each of your words	217.09295027905608
burns me like molten lead?”	208.90392938525602
“Then,” continued Milady, “then I collected all my strength; I recalled	344.38965969300006
to my mind that the moment of vengeance, or rather, of justice, had	309.5787588392896
struck. I looked upon myself as another Judith; I gathered myself up,	243.73704690968805
my knife in my hand, and when I saw him near me, stretching out his	177.56253343164758
arms to find his victim, then, with the last cry of agony and despair,	335.618496071007
I struck him in the middle of his breast.	196.14447800299945
“The miserable villain! He had foreseen all. His breast was covered	266.9805673340521
with a coat-of-mail; the knife was bent against it.	243.8878694667726
“‘Ah, ah!’ cried he, seizing my arm, and wresting from me the weapon	202.74915221560138
that had so badly served me, ‘you want to take my life, do you, my	193.34163389248118
pretty Puritan? But that’s more than dislike, that’s ingratitude! Come,	273.35487657155204
come, calm yourself, my sweet girl! I thought you had softened. I am	259.8695129505853
not one of those tyrants who detain women by force. You don’t love me.	331.8832314066566
With my usual fatuity I doubted it; now I am convinced. Tomorrow you	275.52386469017597
shall be free.’	353.51327845606255
“I had but one wish; that was that he should kill me.	226.8938459517465
“‘Beware!’ said I, ‘for my liberty is your dishonor.’	335.8894029553326
“‘Explain yourself, my pretty sibyl!’	238.9994383916958
“‘Yes; for as soon as I leave this place I will tell everything. I will	285.05611237523976
proclaim the violence you have used toward me. I will describe my	259.71773102973907
captivity. I will denounce this place of infamy. You are placed on	197.68853164575438
high, my Lord, but tremble! Above you there is the king; above the king	259.50955164444906
there is God!’	243.69699876774317
“However perfect master he was over himself, my persecutor allowed a	321.5413659901237
movement of anger to escape him. I could not see the expression of his	336.0936923635654
countenance, but I felt the arm tremble upon which my hand was placed.	326.43828989438134
“‘Then you shall not leave this place,’ said he.	293.63714587576175
“‘Very well,’ cried I, ‘then the place of my punishment will be that of	198.14583576690313
my tomb. I will die here, and you will see if a phantom that accuses is	305.21016654565165
not more terrible than a living being that threatens!’	288.0430240247641
“‘You shall have no weapon left in your power.’	238.94910274907718
“‘There is a weapon which despair has placed within the reach of every	267.37769464303824
creature who has the courage to use it. I will allow myself to die with	342.7024930961079
hunger.’	222.92374944801614
“‘Come,’ said the wretch, ‘is not peace much better than such a war as	204.2444171535377
that? I will restore you to liberty this moment; I will proclaim you a	347.2117321052237
piece of immaculate virtue; I will name you the Lucretia of England.’	311.66616401279936
“‘And I will say that you are the Sextus. I will denounce you before	178.90117652850836
men, as I have denounced you before God; and if it be necessary that,	240.1521878342542
like Lucretia, I should sign my accusation with my blood, I will sign	202.8083650767723
it.’	262.41312046865085
“‘Ah!’ said my enemy, in a jeering tone, ‘that’s quite another thing.	306.14969568991216
My faith! everything considered, you are very well off here. You shall	233.2540641327895
want for nothing, and if you let yourself die of hunger that will be	325.79925277296286
your own fault.’	353.6592646446069
“At these words he retired. I heard the door open and shut, and I	178.87447065776
remained overwhelmed, less, I confess it, by my grief than by the	277.70120900330346
mortification of not having avenged myself.	316.0801456382328
“He kept his word. All the day, all the next night passed away without	279.0549980627711
my seeing him again. But I also kept my word with him, and I neither	305.8038985650031
ate nor drank. I was, as I told him, resolved to die of hunger.	335.2365611907836
“I passed the day and the night in prayer, for I hoped that God would	285.93805085736227
pardon me my suicide.	273.48867744848144
“The second night the door opened; I was lying on the floor, for my	200.4558657335485
strength began to abandon me.	229.09895118289785
“At the noise I raised myself up on one hand.	241.01818369546953
“‘Well,’ said a voice which vibrated in too terrible a manner in my ear	253.48233390813425
not to be recognized, ‘well! Are we softened a little? Will we not pay	246.54773806400533
for our liberty with a single promise of silence? Come, I am a good	196.93794215842144
sort of a prince,’ added he, ‘and although I like not Puritans I do	298.74820911997153
them justice; and it is the same with Puritanesses, when they are	355.4170868066449
pretty. Come, take a little oath for me on the cross; I won’t ask	287.2514579935207
anything more of you.’	210.75663696069444
“‘On the cross,’ cried I, rising, for at that abhorred voice I had	239.98342053548754
recovered all my strength, ‘on the cross I swear that no promise, no	363.95959418316863
menace, no force, no torture, shall close my mouth! On the cross I	281.3226548389668
swear to denounce you everywhere as a murderer, as a thief of honor, as	365.99172897215203
a base coward! On the cross I swear, if I ever leave this place, to	329.1261394962279
call down vengeance upon you from the whole human race!’	340.86879526765347
“‘Beware!’ said the voice, in a threatening accent that I had never yet	347.3583661210174
heard. ‘I have an extraordinary means which I will not employ but in	326.62222687799556
the last extremity to close your mouth, or at least to prevent anyone	224.05992579763654
from believing a word you may utter.’	358.0798950520851
“I mustered all my strength to reply to him with a burst of laughter.	281.929136936706
“He saw that it was a merciless war between us—a war to the death.	290.74202406564154
“‘Listen!’ said he. ‘I give you the rest of tonight and all day	271.9574424336061
tomorrow. Reflect: promise to be silent, and riches, consideration,	294.9187992468103
even honor, shall surround you; threaten to speak, and I will condemn	312.2135377404294
you to infamy.’	215.2649429153941
“‘You?’ cried I. ‘You?’	292.98198903653235
“‘To interminable, ineffaceable infamy!’	354.650466849239
“‘You?’ repeated I. Oh, I declare to you, Felton, I thought him mad!	355.1644997377354
“‘Yes, yes, I!’ replied he.	341.5766669108699
“‘Oh, leave me!’ said I. ‘Begone, if you do not desire to see me dash	315.166701205363
my head against that wall before your eyes!’	231.8316194014772
“‘Very well, it is your own doing. Till tomorrow evening, then!’	243.10555143539756
“‘Till tomorrow evening, then!’ replied I, allowing myself to fall, and	174.3447610404726
biting the carpet with rage.”	246.99309656048433
Felton leaned for support upon a piece of furniture; and Milady saw,	351.3523595980651
with the joy of a demon, that his strength would fail him perhaps	264.31143912293214
before the end of her recital.	337.7156386729729
Chapter LVII.	230.90545836376515
MEANS FOR CLASSICAL TRAGEDY	285.93357810155095
After a moment of silence employed by Milady in observing the young man	282.4883768338781
who listened to her, Milady continued her recital.	327.1768767743604
“It was nearly three days since I had eaten or drunk anything. I	312.0651559386637
suffered frightful torments. At times there passed before me clouds	318.4491196625663
which pressed my brow, which veiled my eyes; this was delirium.	336.81182295146397
“When the evening came I was so weak that every time I fainted I	363.21281571195857
thanked God, for I thought I was about to die.	245.69118110596088
“In the midst of one of these swoons I heard the door open. Terror	286.5253275938678
recalled me to myself.	353.04585797280106
“He entered the apartment followed by a man in a mask. He was masked	235.0115342738273
likewise; but I knew his step, I knew his voice, I knew him by that	252.8043167208066
imposing bearing which hell has bestowed upon his person for the curse	208.5107633729167
of humanity.	323.7780522131429
“‘Well,’ said he to me, ‘have you made your mind up to take the oath I	223.5277225192077
requested of you?’	281.3578399932412
“‘You have said Puritans have but one word. Mine you have heard, and	230.133340296467
that is to pursue you—on earth to the tribunal of men, in heaven to the	225.18812004345241
tribunal of God.’	285.0793300626601
“‘You persist, then?’	319.1779518864032
“‘I swear it before the God who hears me. I will take the whole world	232.57898501566697
as a witness of your crime, and that until I have found an avenger.’	224.25068371938949
“‘You are a prostitute,’ said he, in a voice of thunder, ‘and you shall	339.3911326432403
undergo the punishment of prostitutes! Branded in the eyes of the world	267.04327828526226
you invoke, try to prove to that world that you are neither guilty nor	236.91753572822552
mad!’	282.0552428236382
“Then, addressing the man who accompanied him, ‘Executioner,’ said he,	199.42787746888155
‘do your duty.’”	183.14685453222756
“Oh, his name, his name!” cried Felton. “His name, tell it me!”	298.43764409775196
“Then in spite of my cries, in spite of my resistance—for I began to	289.20395941686957
comprehend that there was a question of something worse than death—the	244.78414060198259
executioner seized me, threw me on the floor, fastened me with his	254.95295793561877
bonds, and suffocated by sobs, almost without sense, invoking God, who	332.9990455354564
did not listen to me, I uttered all at once a frightful cry of pain and	206.37099446628577
shame. A burning fire, a red-hot iron, the iron of the executioner, was	344.84447005142624
imprinted on my shoulder.”	207.76329376582368
Felton uttered a groan.	344.31619994140783
“Here,” said Milady, rising with the majesty of a queen, “here, Felton,	227.21002594021488
behold the new martyrdom invented for a pure young girl, the victim of	250.65036459817443
the brutality of a villain. Learn to know the heart of men, and	277.98715947295807
henceforth make yourself less easily the instrument of their unjust	357.4209266449375
vengeance.”	198.21972575694326
Milady, with a rapid gesture, opened her robe, tore the cambric that	302.9841172179739
covered her bosom, and red with feigned anger and simulated shame,	312.8635558353359
showed the young man the ineffaceable impression which dishonored that	320.63979027380054
beautiful shoulder.	327.441029538255
“But,” cried Felton, “that is a _fleur-de-lis_ which I see there.”	245.00222774415693
“And therein consisted the infamy,” replied Milady. “The brand of	328.318770801898
England!—it would be necessary to prove what tribunal had imposed it on	304.64922868889755
me, and I could have made a public appeal to all the tribunals of the	195.46894251264044
kingdom; but the brand of France!—oh, by that, by _that_ I was branded	313.1276287158662
indeed!”	229.57776899368582
This was too much for Felton.	287.16385827136315
Pale, motionless, overwhelmed by this frightful revelation, dazzled by	363.4766309095495
the superhuman beauty of this woman who unveiled herself before him	334.26476690741134
with an immodesty which appeared to him sublime, he ended by falling on	230.6367257307134
his knees before her as the early Christians did before those pure and	273.75832580981324
holy martyrs whom the persecution of the emperors gave up in the circus	182.87111220526342
to the sanguinary sensuality of the populace. The brand disappeared;	358.9862338433097
the beauty alone remained.	242.0061015211595
“Pardon! Pardon!” cried Felton, “oh, pardon!”	230.88562507868704
Milady read in his eyes _love! love!_	273.77502875656614
“Pardon for what?” asked she.	180.32015508746122
“Pardon me for having joined with your persecutors.”	272.33264437937214
Milady held out her hand to him.	190.15043033992984
“So beautiful! so young!” cried Felton, covering that hand with his	199.68059999214313
kisses.	297.55674451505695
Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a	227.9517950641233
king.	206.60313462477885
Felton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her	219.65356633617588
feet.	326.72487583241514
He no longer loved her; he adored her.	236.90184122932808
When this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her	349.70610366433084
self-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her	181.23301680240533
recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were	218.060824871699
only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he	196.45893086993237
said, “Ah, now! I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name	181.46791912820666
of your true executioner. For to me there is but one; the other was an	354.5868469646748
instrument, that was all.”	190.52279559854503
“What, brother!” cried Milady, “must I name him again? Have you not yet	332.9080124484705
divined who he is?”	200.17499742024694
“What?” cried Felton, “he—again he—always he? What—the truly guilty?”	346.09492976167786
“The truly guilty,” said Milady, “is the ravager of England, the	280.48193452667823
persecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many	260.8239865442576
women—he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to	196.62952529480603
make England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and	345.5442398844605
will betray them tomorrow—”	336.29682321286606
“Buckingham! It is, then, Buckingham!” cried Felton, in a high state of	301.8347285602775
excitement.	333.15789776247516
Milady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the	237.93730263300085
shame which this name recalled to her.	313.87438559339625
“Buckingham, the executioner of this angelic creature!” cried Felton.	320.59706767544617
“And thou hast not hurled thy thunder at him, my God! And thou hast	230.62539317453178
left him noble, honored, powerful, for the ruin of us all!”	194.04300526603038
“God abandons him who abandons himself,” said Milady.	230.75560180327466
“But he will draw upon his head the punishment reserved for the	293.90828285731055
damned!” said Felton, with increasing exultation. “He wills that human	271.41431627658216
vengeance should precede celestial justice.”	327.4389206827298
“Men fear him and spare him.”	221.7476452709421
“I,” said Felton, “I do not fear him, nor will I spare him.”	288.94878074555794
The soul of Milady was bathed in an infernal joy.	167.46816686761179
“But how can Lord de Winter, my protector, my father,” asked Felton,	192.32779001656547
“possibly be mixed up with all this?”	258.0823075180548
“Listen, Felton,” resumed Milady, “for by the side of base and	365.9649314701715
contemptible men there are often found great and generous natures. I	277.7777531882724
had an affianced husband, a man whom I loved, and who loved me—a heart	304.9559724103596
like yours, Felton, a man like you. I went to him and told him all; he	278.46839450081035
knew me, that man did, and did not doubt an instant. He was a nobleman,	280.59670083804684
a man equal to Buckingham in every respect. He said nothing; he only	353.57275932213525
girded on his sword, wrapped himself in his cloak, and went straight to	275.6963236160867
Buckingham Palace.	186.17352005342207
“Yes, yes,” said Felton; “I understand how he would act. But with such	336.57455942736146
men it is not the sword that should be employed; it is the poniard.”	188.30605275035722
“Buckingham had left England the day before, sent as ambassador to	302.3331241088092
Spain, to demand the hand of the Infanta for King Charles I., who was	255.78925133665524
then only Prince of Wales. My affianced husband returned.	306.02218686105925
“‘Hear me,’ said he; ‘this man has gone, and for the moment has	296.9548284867995
consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to	335.17359696424023
have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own	245.7463185830942
honor and that of his wife.’”	206.76661615182795
“Lord de Winter!” cried Felton.	190.58818353092406
“Yes,” said Milady, “Lord de Winter; and now you can understand it all,	189.86043759481785
can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before	270.92640339743957
his return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came	280.6755047207173
the blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I	197.9880384074892
accuse nobody.”	335.75700190215184
“Oh, what an abyss; what an abyss!” cried Felton.	335.3070756783957
“Lord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The	322.5173809071654
terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of	233.74178437461177
thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain	355.9460679096186
this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was	199.85894820429704
sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in	312.8562336652363
his hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to	169.25660605781843
remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England.	179.7459297015462
Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I	217.78877750421321
was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at	344.25115548600945
Portsmouth.”	313.8671644455598
“Well?” said Felton.	316.72494213657626
“Well; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke	293.7559733440277
of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him	343.7772864758949
that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman. The noble and	355.46394064150365
pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me. Lord de	336.70283513506513
Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that	207.82068332064432
it was his interest to believe it. He caused me to be arrested, had me	172.93621459426032
conducted hither, and placed me under your guard. You know the rest.	196.84527680509854
The day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after	209.9722498315317
tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous. Oh, the train is well laid;	341.39290780872875
the plot is clever. My honor will not survive it! You see, then,	299.01753385602296
Felton, I can do nothing but die. Felton, give me that knife!”	176.03126693944301
And at these words, as if all her strength was exhausted, Milady sank,	267.5487477519207
weak and languishing, into the arms of the young officer, who,	331.39574945965285
intoxicated with love, anger, and voluptuous sensations hitherto	323.78069657338693
unknown, received her with transport, pressed her against his heart,	353.25393469716687
all trembling at the breath from that charming mouth, bewildered by the	365.71547838446054
contact with that palpitating bosom.	308.627852924487
“No, no,” said he. “No, you shall live honored and pure; you shall live	308.3309458124796
to triumph over your enemies.”	338.69532838247034
Milady put him from her slowly with her hand, while drawing him nearer	272.4586859718772
with her look; but Felton, in his turn, embraced her more closely,	301.6098972964218
imploring her like a divinity.	247.68085782426567
“Oh, death, death!” said she, lowering her voice and her eyelids, “oh,	258.8586956654163
death, rather than shame! Felton, my brother, my friend, I conjure	350.95491022281635
you!”	295.69486407745467
“No,” cried Felton, “no; you shall live and you shall be avenged.”	252.60757281631714
“Felton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me! Felton, abandon me!	320.0286510259018
Felton, let me die!”	217.77265331841824
“Well, then, we will live and die together!” cried he, pressing his	327.414806431806
lips to those of the prisoner.	241.8432620989036
Several strokes resounded on the door; this time Milady really pushed	257.5836462952047
him away from her.	185.43861861998704
“Hark,” said she, “we have been overheard! Someone is coming! All is	365.8178454912078
over! We are lost!”	249.88045186483356
“No,” said Felton; it is only the sentinel warning me that they are	330.33247687212986
about to change the guard.”	301.143806233517
“Then run to the door, and open it yourself.”	234.82780016928064
Felton obeyed; this woman was now his whole thought, his whole soul.	284.3283070295512
He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a	335.07734072088124
watch-patrol.	352.28058709336335
“Well, what is the matter?” asked the young lieutenant.	227.81627397757651
“You told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out,” said the	247.25830880369304
soldier; “but you forgot to leave me the key. I heard you cry out,	358.65610256742735
without understanding what you said. I tried to open the door, but it	204.00314870587457
was locked inside; then I called the sergeant.”	210.23456652809517
“And here I am,” said the sergeant.	166.21980810063172
Felton, quite bewildered, almost mad, stood speechless.	313.4112411916227
Milady plainly perceived that it was now her turn to take part in the	188.90246453257492
scene. She ran to the table, and seizing the knife which Felton had	324.1906764192404
laid down, exclaimed, “And by what right will you prevent me from	303.0819482840283
dying?”	187.50976626379736
“Great God!” exclaimed Felton, on seeing the knife glitter in her hand.	237.70069018404857
At that moment a burst of ironical laughter resounded through the	271.1284491363448
corridor. The baron, attracted by the noise, in his chamber gown, his	215.933183811003
sword under his arm, stood in the doorway.	286.0004422303993
“Ah,” said he, “here we are, at the last act of the tragedy. You see,	231.82850439726525
Felton, the drama has gone through all the phases I named; but be easy,	287.4888838039305
no blood will flow.”	255.04693053955793
Milady perceived that all was lost unless she gave Felton an immediate	276.75688417122495
and terrible proof of her courage.	168.22604852483119
“You are mistaken, my Lord, blood will flow; and may that blood fall	296.58600204976227
back on those who cause it to flow!”	279.08409089835305
Felton uttered a cry, and rushed toward her. He was too late; Milady	313.4067689617425
had stabbed herself.	348.79008984321615
But the knife had fortunately, we ought to say skillfully, come in	327.28874124783044
contact with the steel busk, which at that period, like a cuirass,	242.97432919769568
defended the chests of women. It had glided down it, tearing the robe,	169.89450638457058
and had penetrated slantingly between the flesh and the ribs. Milady’s	333.2264680668262
robe was not the less stained with blood in a second.	215.0503776758686
Milady fell down, and seemed to be in a swoon.	196.15055618000446
Felton snatched away the knife.	324.84584039202343
“See, my Lord,” said he, in a deep, gloomy tone, “here is a woman who	221.10164212194243
was under my guard, and who has killed herself!”	254.13980344329235
“Be at ease, Felton,” said Lord de Winter. “She is not dead; demons do	179.64662915302497
not die so easily. Be tranquil, and go wait for me in my chamber.”	263.4370112003296
“But, my Lord—”	240.2861555594741
“Go, sir, I command you!”	292.4561926509873
At this injunction from his superior, Felton obeyed; but in going out,	364.1789416729281
he put the knife into his bosom.	188.7419211784095
As to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who	347.8332993861346
waited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner,	182.55863907915676
who was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone.	270.55839953172
Meanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions, as	348.01452626010575
the wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to	321.4085020241859
find a physician.	274.3331622894804
Chapter LVIII.	234.94972980426587
ESCAPE	241.69825081951575
As Lord de Winter had thought, Milady’s wound was not dangerous. So	239.99630151103665
soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned	178.5704902175643
to her assistance she opened her eyes.	206.86264937872278
It was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain—not a very	287.80409692175374
difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady. Thus the poor	166.97888977354728
woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner, whom, notwithstanding	319.80818059129257
her hints, she persisted in watching all night.	294.0627560603655
But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking.	236.69067842919833
There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers.	232.70480370672482
If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he	202.79149927631371
would take him, in the mental disposition in which he now found	229.23281093021296
himself, for a messenger sent by the devil.	166.10315819730806
Milady smiled at this thought, for Felton was now her only hope—her	338.17439267231146
only means of safety.	258.003481756986
But Lord de Winter might suspect him; Felton himself might now be	252.31794316568755
watched!	319.4490593366819
Toward four o’clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the	205.10840512677103
time Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The	288.3915370087849
doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of	247.27879753895974
it; he only satisfied himself by Milady’s pulse that the case was not	259.9731589315256
serious.	276.8882376695771
In the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in	233.12390176763483
the night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her.	260.21554098350083
She had one hope, which was that Felton would appear at the breakfast	260.0062513752863
hour; but Felton did not come.	255.60785010595555
Were her fears realized? Was Felton, suspected by the baron, about to	310.0602438555395
fail her at the decisive moment? She had only one day left. Lord de	178.64544434394338
Winter had announced her embarkation for the twenty-third, and it was	206.18710744422663
now the morning of the twenty-second.	184.09871031653879
Nevertheless she still waited patiently till the hour for dinner.	335.87487735669663
Although she had eaten nothing in the morning, the dinner was brought	228.6956633041023
in at its usual time. Milady then perceived, with terror, that the	351.7874628621147
uniform of the soldiers who guarded her was changed.	223.04984898595382
Then she ventured to ask what had become of Felton.	340.507275348618
She was told that he had left the castle an hour before on horseback.	357.3112380489083
She inquired if the baron was still at the castle. The soldier replied	200.98891735159995
that he was, and that he had given orders to be informed if the	216.9126294403102
prisoner wished to speak to him.	169.04137532870067
Milady replied that she was too weak at present, and that her only	272.3514859851699
desire was to be left alone.	195.16119511978562
The soldier went out, leaving the dinner served.	208.82006842472222
Felton was sent away. The marines were removed. Felton was then	248.1634718957356
mistrusted.	260.06100354682525
This was the last blow to the prisoner.	209.8825285240201
Left alone, she arose. The bed, which she had kept from prudence and	169.88250624328077
that they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of	307.3268071420338
fire. She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed	277.19266964119066
over the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might	303.2621011613728
still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards.	330.9701933178579
Milady smiled with joy. She was free now to give way to her transports	225.83297478868667
without being observed. She traversed her chamber with the excitement	211.3439697117622
of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage. _Certes_,	327.770933843026
if the knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought,	182.33459396993513
not of killing herself, but of killing the baron.	331.1190635192671
At six o’clock Lord de Winter came in. He was armed at all points. This	179.989234237971
man, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple	287.33653909095267
gentleman, had become an admirable jailer. He appeared to foresee all,	262.80631120924915
to divine all, to anticipate all.	353.22445595726714
A single look at Milady apprised him of all that was passing in her	207.80938323787763
mind.	198.10229384920234
“Ay!” said he, “I see; but you shall not kill me today. You have no	319.35489012796484
longer a weapon; and besides, I am on my guard. You had begun to	190.18496329106233
pervert my poor Felton. He was yielding to your infernal influence; but	249.81175563657035
I will save him. He will never see you again; all is over. Get your	318.49074972438905
clothes together. Tomorrow you will go. I had fixed the embarkation for	354.8904825416481
the twenty-fourth; but I have reflected that the more promptly the	296.75693505847113
affair takes place the more sure it will be. Tomorrow, by twelve	344.1208904492256
o’clock, I shall have the order for your exile, signed, _Buckingham_.	268.3532006045525
If you speak a single word to anyone before going aboard ship, my	173.20248412244442
sergeant will blow your brains out. He has orders to do so. If when on	323.7446099491825
the ship you speak a single word to anyone before the captain permits	275.226929189426
you, the captain will have you thrown into the sea. That is agreed	166.2020175792347
upon.	269.12789275763987
“_Au revoir_, then; that is all I have to say today. Tomorrow I will	228.2059912942986
see you again, to take my leave.” With these words the baron went out.	280.9925194922919
Milady had listened to all this menacing tirade with a smile of disdain	184.5378214232404
on her lips, but rage in her heart.	212.95144920826814
Supper was served. Milady felt that she stood in need of all her	321.0936661050493
strength. She did not know what might take place during this night	192.32975858737666
which approached so menacingly—for large masses of cloud rolled over	193.01252856481514
the face of the sky, and distant lightning announced a storm.	344.06478927903316
The storm broke about ten o’clock. Milady felt a consolation in seeing	182.63857417223738
nature partake of the disorder of her heart. The thunder growled in the	212.48837458267158
air like the passion and anger in her thoughts. It appeared to her that	192.47615127906775
the blast as it swept along disheveled her brow, as it bowed the	265.72852835350204
branches of the trees and bore away their leaves. She howled as the	181.98991871957395
hurricane howled; and her voice was lost in the great voice of nature,	167.46030640025654
which also seemed to groan with despair.	255.01957078694198
All at once she heard a tap at her window, and by the help of a flash	334.9968654908876
of lightning she saw the face of a man appear behind the bars.	173.42357577713855
She ran to the window and opened it.	190.18873512747763
“Felton!” cried she. “I am saved.”	217.038353646005
“Yes,” said Felton; “but silence, silence! I must have time to file	322.94384358575945
through these bars. Only take care that I am not seen through the	272.3571937315371
wicket.”	190.87372290280393
“Oh, it is a proof that the Lord is on our side, Felton,” replied	364.47922365286274
Milady. “They have closed up the grating with a board.”	169.33150154940907
“That is well; God has made them senseless,” said Felton.	230.2346344189875
“But what must I do?” asked Milady.	337.5954076930699
“Nothing, nothing, only shut the window. Go to bed, or at least lie	319.39631679523814
down in your clothes. As soon as I have done I will knock on one of the	167.58385336467126
panes of glass. But will you be able to follow me?”	184.78478224436745
“Oh, yes!”	232.06030092440733
“Your wound?”	286.99824932667326
“Gives me pain, but will not prevent my walking.”	185.0463421378534
“Be ready, then, at the first signal.”	225.4820774340971
Milady shut the window, extinguished the lamp, and went, as Felton had	333.86071113226177
desired her, to lie down on the bed. Amid the moaning of the storm she	233.23480149369038
heard the grinding of the file upon the bars, and by the light of every	209.98405464720804
flash she perceived the shadow of Felton through the panes.	299.90510777597365
She passed an hour without breathing, panting, with a cold sweat upon	243.79963767760154
her brow, and her heart oppressed by frightful agony at every movement	296.5920037828123
she heard in the corridor.	222.16555913815262
There are hours which last a year.	196.54216401742417
At the expiration of an hour, Felton tapped again.	339.6710327646377
Milady sprang out of bed and opened the window. Two bars removed formed	296.09421618102397
an opening for a man to pass through.	275.86919562598
“Are you ready?” asked Felton.	251.9771165855799
“Yes. Must I take anything with me?”	201.81931889762168
“Money, if you have any.”	248.6310556422917
“Yes; fortunately they have left me all I had.”	265.39881162353953
“So much the better, for I have expended all mine in chartering a	181.83219014701774
vessel.”	338.5696867316999
“Here!” said Milady, placing a bag full of louis in Felton’s hands.	240.33035171651983
Felton took the bag and threw it to the foot of the wall.	201.28124337810272
“Now,” said he, “will you come?”	361.1782716271241
“I am ready.”	181.89459606459445
Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body	356.74225375400874
through the window. She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss	238.8496063295823
by a ladder of ropes. For the first time an emotion of terror reminded	171.56879843862745
her that she was a woman.	261.96154147233676
The dark space frightened her.	222.68171711640355
“I expected this,” said Felton.	211.2352100752406
“It’s nothing, it’s nothing!” said Milady. “I will descend with my eyes	357.25990586181535
shut.”	348.16728578666743
“Have you confidence in me?” said Felton.	196.32481060083893
“You ask that?”	335.6981429185417
“Put your two hands together. Cross them; that’s right!”	192.5963514199842
Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then	217.67899410693465
with a cord over the handkerchief.	247.7394708343135
“What are you doing?” asked Milady, with surprise.	276.53103606964606
“Pass your arms around my neck, and fear nothing.”	282.1733177574166
“But I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to	183.11793089884316
pieces.”	358.5561043687561
“Don’t be afraid. I am a sailor.”	273.92043024491005
Not a second was to be lost. Milady passed her two arms round Felton’s	272.581841311355
neck, and let herself slip out of the window. Felton began to descend	223.23522499405823
the ladder slowly, step by step. Despite the weight of two bodies, the	326.697212105718
blast of the hurricane shook them in the air.	362.11756049097414
All at once Felton stopped.	346.51638846084916
“What is the matter?” asked Milady.	252.17931871824015
“Silence,” said Felton, “I hear footsteps.”	194.56257010213997
“We are discovered!”	203.6690844462313
There was a silence of several seconds.	199.31554426893922
“No,” said Felton, “it is nothing.”	261.4036543619555
“But what, then, is the noise?”	200.61033979106796
“That of the patrol going their rounds.”	314.7940942288176
“Where is their road?”	267.1846044789041
“Just under us.”	178.3774839278824
“They will discover us!”	193.95839019489478
“No, if it does not lighten.”	259.27473997196387
“But they will run against the bottom of the ladder.”	321.66123833610675
“Fortunately it is too short by six feet.”	314.70348768845065
“Here they are! My God!”	256.93431226051956
“Silence!”	235.00230977330992
Both remained suspended, motionless and breathless, within twenty paces	311.48278319484325
of the ground, while the patrol passed beneath them laughing and	322.61228811099863
talking. This was a terrible moment for the fugitives.	265.6254845165649
The patrol passed. The noise of their retreating footsteps and the	222.67626076818115
murmur of their voices soon died away.	301.6046694288424
“Now,” said Felton, “we are safe.”	288.9967330662141
Milady breathed a deep sigh and fainted.	343.674533075746
Felton continued to descend. Near the bottom of the ladder, when he	332.33579789021996
found no more support for his feet, he clung with his hands; at length,	174.3622326248809
arrived at the last step, he let himself hang by the strength of his	304.7919371014626
wrists, and touched the ground. He stooped down, picked up the bag of	198.37445497222802
money, and placed it between his teeth. Then he took Milady in his	291.7548792490519
arms, and set off briskly in the direction opposite to that which the	318.66096187719415
patrol had taken. He soon left the pathway of the patrol, descended	336.8333613314471
across the rocks, and when arrived on the edge of the sea, whistled.	253.52259979830035
A similar signal replied to him; and five minutes after, a boat	343.37724314767496
appeared, rowed by four men.	227.59383709728908
The boat approached as near as it could to the shore; but there was not	210.1021644631471
depth enough of water for it to touch land. Felton walked into the sea	294.0653330974244
up to his middle, being unwilling to trust his precious burden to	345.3371975686869
anybody.	314.1100473426259
Fortunately the storm began to subside, but still the sea was	290.7636049512456
disturbed. The little boat bounded over the waves like a nut-shell.	321.02954433751745
“To the sloop,” said Felton, “and row quickly.”	311.6250472581703
The four men bent to their oars, but the sea was too high to let them	284.60164463808053
get much hold of it.	315.0858407159187
However, they left the castle behind; that was the principal thing. The	197.20163669802122
night was extremely dark. It was almost impossible to see the shore	197.71303031183788
from the boat; they would therefore be less likely to see the boat from	300.30212801497066
the shore.	343.71995500187086
A black point floated on the sea. That was the sloop. While the boat	235.92694060485002
was advancing with all the speed its four rowers could give it, Felton	201.43304635750707
untied the cord and then the handkerchief which bound Milady’s hands	255.03756486443632
together. When her hands were loosed he took some sea water and	322.9848729147001
sprinkled it over her face.	225.30648713129554
Milady breathed a sigh, and opened her eyes.	355.2733811497976
“Where am I?” said she.	258.5994451679379
“Saved!” replied the young officer.	200.24068295062386
“Oh, saved, saved!” cried she. “Yes, there is the sky; here is the sea!	348.6930851819303
The air I breathe is the air of liberty! Ah, thanks, Felton, thanks!”	296.64745901910453
The young man pressed her to his heart.	321.4064715679857
“But what is the matter with my hands!” asked Milady; “it seems as if	314.8387303206581
my wrists had been crushed in a vice.”	269.58878068060784
Milady held out her arms; her wrists were bruised.	229.74004324584635
“Alas!” said Felton, looking at those beautiful hands, and shaking his	315.26210453766134
head sorrowfully.	243.47481786336306
“Oh, it’s nothing, nothing!” cried Milady. “I remember now.”	277.3384683863595
Milady looked around her, as if in search of something.	340.1901662628942
“It is there,” said Felton, touching the bag of money with his foot.	167.12265898571175
They drew near to the sloop. A sailor on watch hailed the boat; the	287.7834392516319
boat replied.	232.61035213916824
“What vessel is that?” asked Milady.	271.07946411594736
“The one I have hired for you.”	310.60661460442293
“Where will it take me?”	217.7670543313375
“Where you please, after you have put me on shore at Portsmouth.”	272.7146782079714
“What are you going to do at Portsmouth?” asked Milady.	195.54122717185024
“Accomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,” said Felton, with a gloomy	257.59140379453476
smile.	356.38590991380624
“What orders?” asked Milady.	358.01398893745716
“You do not understand?” asked Felton.	306.5665350917286
“No; explain yourself, I beg.”	244.99458284466522
“As he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me	178.14761499933508
in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your	280.4955492424027
transportation.”	259.8907769986453
“But if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?”	205.27028371990676
“How could I know what I was the bearer of?”	308.4470117566508
“That’s true! And you are going to Portsmouth?”	210.80044732723618
“I have no time to lose. Tomorrow is the twenty-third, and Buckingham	319.0947341736629
sets sail tomorrow with his fleet.”	256.3633904159236
“He sets sail tomorrow! Where for?”	202.03768359488134
“For La Rochelle.”	349.3033988004921
“He need not sail!” cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of	189.05830807125804
mind.	314.2555328237329
“Be satisfied,” replied Felton; “he will not sail.”	341.25878254148506
Milady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart of	283.16551870436973
this young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full	335.8427618528858
length.	314.84159953141636
“Felton,” cried she, “you are as great as Judas Maccabeus! If you die,	333.4652991877111
I will die with you; that is all I can say to you.”	303.5670656524829
“Silence!” cried Felton; “we are here.”	339.7604913991068
In fact, they touched the sloop.	209.61116045932346
Felton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the	227.45961164625135
sailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated.	279.62545490069283
An instant after they were on the deck.	342.4152443387941
“Captain,” said Felton, “this is the person of whom I spoke to you, and	284.096416502967
whom you must convey safe and sound to France.”	188.94878055788527
“For a thousand pistoles,” said the captain.	344.01269341108843
“I have paid you five hundred of them.”	328.7975114015366
“That’s correct,” said the captain.	179.10949530519113
“And here are the other five hundred,” replied Milady, placing her hand	343.8293171050442
upon the bag of gold.	166.76576293236687
“No,” said the captain, “I make but one bargain; and I have agreed with	245.00066334444153
this young man that the other five hundred shall not be due to me till	198.9190588022263
we arrive at Boulogne.”	209.55308024483188
“And shall we arrive there?”	304.4188119183655
“Safe and sound, as true as my name’s Jack Butler.”	230.27471942988655
“Well,” said Milady, “if you keep your word, instead of five hundred, I	218.715563816829
will give you a thousand pistoles.”	270.04216224968405
“Hurrah for you, then, my beautiful lady,” cried the captain; “and may	335.4629175055672
God often send me such passengers as your Ladyship!”	353.2393481124575
“Meanwhile,” said Felton, “convey me to the little bay of—; you know it	268.48954581449897
was agreed you should put in there.”	262.07340291061263
The captain replied by ordering the necessary maneuvers, and toward	296.4873059093597
seven o’clock in the morning the little vessel cast anchor in the bay	181.9363030032035
that had been named.	222.97808334600404
During this passage, Felton related everything to Milady—how, instead	221.22979111217538
of going to London, he had chartered the little vessel; how he had	186.58616360574516
returned; how he had scaled the wall by fastening cramps in the	324.4291731563138
interstices of the stones, as he ascended, to give him foothold; and	269.94620882836864
how, when he had reached the bars, he fastened his ladder. Milady knew	329.62228130261144
the rest.	343.9247693884775
On her side, Milady tried to encourage Felton in his project; but at	279.0821570712758
the first words which issued from her mouth, she plainly saw that the	225.69379996728418
young fanatic stood more in need of being moderated than urged.	245.82239211086846
It was agreed that Milady should wait for Felton till ten o’clock; if	328.6173701571603
he did not return by ten o’clock she was to sail.	237.23936562809342
In that case, and supposing he was at liberty, he was to rejoin her in	365.42382320672476
France, at the convent of the Carmelites at Béthune.	320.01229584093034
Chapter LIX.	188.5188049531177
WHAT TOOK PLACE AT PORTSMOUTH	314.79583179796055
AUGUST 23, 1628	271.9122177564685
Felton took leave of Milady as a brother about to go for a mere walk	169.73426290119363
takes leave of his sister, kissing her hand.	258.3863439219935
His whole body appeared in its ordinary state of calmness, only an	230.93487591006686
unusual fire beamed from his eyes, like the effects of a fever; his	341.44678827466714
brow was more pale than it generally was; his teeth were clenched, and	181.11553470005472
his speech had a short dry accent which indicated that something dark	203.29433263696222
was at work within him.	271.3436266438678
As long as he remained in the boat which conveyed him to land, he kept	247.13388637939534
his face toward Milady, who, standing on the deck, followed him with	181.8400420703107
her eyes. Both were free from the fear of pursuit; nobody ever came	328.8053374883664
into Milady’s apartment before nine o’clock, and it would require three	190.48553358129618
hours to go from the castle to London.	234.41791421373327
Felton jumped onshore, climbed the little ascent which led to the top	315.82915566875374
of the cliff, saluted Milady a last time, and took his course toward	326.7833217878083
the city.	327.56883095117223
At the end of a hundred paces, the ground began to decline, and he	187.7562711046775
could only see the mast of the sloop.	206.2754752339235
He immediately ran in the direction of Portsmouth, which he saw at	345.20662776145866
nearly half a league before him, standing out in the haze of the	354.9854530864759
morning, with its houses and towers.	170.79224121551843
Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a	195.53747231351406
forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the	203.58716399849894
wind.	211.41857757597415
Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations	304.83777988732845
against the favorite of James I. and Charles I., furnished by two years	172.40132422272356
of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans.	258.38339310069114
When he compared the public crimes of this minister—startling crimes,	237.72190156553353
European crimes, if so we may say—with the private and unknown crimes	213.90216476397143
with which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable	283.4939190327056
of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of	260.7457570647202
whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so	241.38463852263607
strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and	353.1309781589711
imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying	339.858387089448
glass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible	253.66651142186652
by the side of an ant.	347.4968268020351
The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he	197.69697779154225
left behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved,	242.65110061856626
or rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced,	292.4773612329749
present fatigue—all together exalted his mind above human feeling.	249.25194242821323
He entered Portsmouth about eight o’clock in the morning. The whole	302.3158114559866
population was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the	339.1257518043931
port; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.	176.26056265196263
Felton arrived at the palace of the Admiralty, covered with dust, and	237.63240116820378
streaming with perspiration. His countenance, usually so pale, was	316.7055206354251
purple with heat and passion. The sentinel wanted to repulse him; but	324.9240713817247
Felton called to the officer of the post, and drawing from his pocket	316.2491137881657
the letter of which he was the bearer, he said, “A pressing message	363.26295797755154
from Lord de Winter.”	358.6063182484255
At the name of Lord de Winter, who was known to be one of his Grace’s	237.1231440611512
most intimate friends, the officer of the post gave orders to let	189.95015618066287
Felton pass, who, besides, wore the uniform of a naval officer.	284.6360718306262
Felton darted into the palace.	256.7787849366056
At the moment he entered the vestibule, another man was entering	275.5706791750746
likewise, dusty, out of breath, leaving at the gate a post horse,	187.36372997318074
which, on reaching the palace, tumbled on his foreknees.	289.9061350102951
Felton and he addressed Patrick, the duke’s confidential lackey, at the	196.70295054818712
same moment. Felton named Lord de Winter; the unknown would not name	231.79827947850032
anybody, and pretended that it was to the duke alone he would make	280.40629160360385
himself known. Each was anxious to gain admission before the other.	243.69696026194964
Patrick, who knew Lord de Winter was in affairs of the service, and in	255.544016246546
relations of friendship with the duke, gave the preference to the one	253.36083245382653
who came in his name. The other was forced to wait, and it was easily	340.1247394939445
to be seen how he cursed the delay.	247.42350610485767
The valet led Felton through a large hall in which waited the deputies	335.86201690620834
from La Rochelle, headed by the Prince de Soubise, and introduced him	195.30246090613835
into a closet where Buckingham, just out of the bath, was finishing his	295.0784760938876
toilet, upon which, as at all times, he bestowed extraordinary	257.73092945277165
attention.	273.62293831553626
“Lieutenant Felton, from Lord de Winter,” said Patrick.	186.46563973576002
“From Lord de Winter!” repeated Buckingham; “let him come in.”	247.13627197100092
Felton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a	365.2946722119987
rich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet	294.54157252327735
doublet embroidered with pearls.	199.20410679462518
“Why didn’t the baron come himself?” demanded Buckingham. “I expected	235.04203663281328
him this morning.”	290.04042467594144
“He desired me to tell your Grace,” replied Felton, “that he very much	178.08120845455514
regretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard	319.1538100393327
he is obliged to keep at the castle.”	197.5502289673826
“Yes, I know that,” said Buckingham; “he has a prisoner.”	322.00918918885327
“It is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace,” replied	301.3710746066268
Felton.	261.6745681281808
“Well, then, speak!”	356.5689991378474
“That which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself, my	232.62061402951127
Lord!”	325.9331799826808
“Leave us, Patrick,” said Buckingham; “but remain within sound of the	279.58346069777775
bell. I shall call you presently.”	206.86943815626802
Patrick went out.	227.09731977570314
“We are alone, sir,” said Buckingham; “speak!”	241.46798956986328
“My Lord,” said Felton, “the Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day	220.102223177748
to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young	326.9935963172494
woman named Charlotte Backson.”	177.41366422395856
“Yes, sir; and I answered him, to bring or send me that order and I	343.3944504796526
would sign it.”	280.838954132494
“Here it is, my Lord.”	299.0510795986024
“Give it to me,” said the duke.	281.9140353946883
And taking it from Felton, he cast a rapid glance over the paper, and	323.70081195990457
perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him, he	360.5309503211642
placed it on the table, took a pen, and prepared to sign it.	200.31673064140915
“Pardon, my Lord,” said Felton, stopping the duke; “but does your Grace	169.58606178442744
know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this	277.1540586899282
young woman?”	214.9559081164556
“Yes, sir, I know it,” replied the duke, dipping the quill in the ink.	318.23464026134565
“Then your Grace knows her real name?” asked Felton, in a sharp tone.	188.1239615987964
“I know it”; and the duke put the quill to the paper. Felton grew pale.	263.4714796817799
“And knowing that real name, my Lord,” replied Felton, “will you sign	250.62275708324177
it all the same?”	253.98076561885523
“Doubtless,” said Buckingham, “and rather twice than once.”	328.5200849870443
“I cannot believe,” continued Felton, in a voice that became more sharp	322.1517082589842
and rough, “that your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this	278.6209725855729
relates.”	168.8366124960729
“I know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.”	297.0717354511954
“And will your Grace sign that order without remorse?”	263.07312779024613
Buckingham looked at the young man haughtily.	238.90944214260608
“Do you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and	221.67060746909718
that I am very foolish to answer them?”	283.77346554503146
“Reply to them, my Lord,” said Felton; “the circumstances are more	226.86590729975455
serious than you perhaps believe.”	353.35501919711487
Buckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter,	314.5434326829158
undoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened.	327.5425686199443
“Without remorse,” said he. “The baron knows, as well as myself, that	175.64236628197787
Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very	206.26894467580232
favorably to commute her punishment to transportation.” The duke put	353.86613340857605
his pen to the paper.	309.36095712450486
“You will not sign that order, my Lord!” said Felton, making a step	337.4265428802387
toward the duke.	267.16746148556655
“I will not sign this order! And why not?”	263.9230088938509
“Because you will look into yourself, and you will do justice to the	341.1053555430541
lady.”	227.67587304824906
“I should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn,” said Buckingham.	253.96904043046453
“This lady is infamous.”	242.8353062962637
“My Lord, Milady de Winter is an angel; you know that she is, and I	305.7905242758784
demand her liberty of you.”	216.0016873034769
“Bah! Are you mad, to talk to me thus?” said Buckingham.	282.66463242800194
“My Lord, excuse me! I speak as I can; I restrain myself. But, my Lord,	303.0006827442676
think of what you’re about to do, and beware of going too far!”	314.34960185506446
“What do you say? God pardon me!” cried Buckingham, “I really think he	277.2470330652119
threatens me!”	295.19482566975864
“No, my Lord, I still plead. And I say to you: one drop of water	208.22583437547132
suffices to make the full vase overflow; one slight fault may draw down	259.91692268190263
punishment upon the head spared, despite many crimes.”	231.26365675493173
“Mr. Felton,” said Buckingham, “you will withdraw, and place yourself	243.73527092695343
at once under arrest.”	193.06642952548407
“You will hear me to the end, my Lord. You have seduced this young	188.40559466356927
girl; you have outraged, defiled her. Repair your crimes toward her;	187.01029294449765
let her go free, and I will exact nothing else from you.”	290.0891941871239
“You will exact!” said Buckingham, looking at Felton with astonishment,	196.6061484416899
and dwelling upon each syllable of the three words as he pronounced	317.44698561487553
them.	181.36373810500993
“My Lord,” continued Felton, becoming more excited as he spoke, “my	203.7407722170305
Lord, beware! All England is tired of your iniquities; my Lord, you	191.34672897689734
have abused the royal power, which you have almost usurped; my Lord,	183.03263664255653
you are held in horror by God and men. God will punish you hereafter,	264.4863358121394
but I will punish you here!”	310.98299006559625
“Ah, this is too much!” cried Buckingham, making a step toward the	271.7404219456736
door.	216.28145232702576
Felton barred his passage.	345.6018825723795
“I ask it humbly of you, my Lord,” said he; “sign the order for the	176.24594137527004
liberation of Milady de Winter. Remember that she is a woman whom you	195.7085378984644
have dishonored.”	293.5090712721461
“Withdraw, sir,” said Buckingham, “or I will call my attendant, and	281.8348512279639
have you placed in irons.”	365.8518686434935
“You shall not call,” said Felton, throwing himself between the duke	329.20566607481567
and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver. “Beware, my Lord,	175.1583619560924
you are in the hands of God!”	251.5728501990277
“In the hands of the devil, you mean!” cried Buckingham, raising his	196.97823804730712
voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely	294.4052580465304
shouting.	223.73262525180877
“Sign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,” said Felton,	286.1520463028525
holding out a paper to the duke.	248.88739916946557
“By force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!”	224.30653733678156
“Sign, my Lord!”	206.80420602554403
“Never.”	299.3564279491794
“Never?”	242.77314954399537
“Help!” shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his	288.70174806912524
sword.	276.69712057757306
But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with	222.0359137970524
which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he	173.9507219702806
was upon the duke.	336.4089945398655
At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, “A letter from France,	347.314645008633
my Lord.”	175.37942989004722
“From France!” cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from	245.71684316067547
whom that letter came.	236.0346964034592
Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his	273.3361748329247
side up to the handle.	347.57056743963443
“Ah, traitor,” cried Buckingham, “you have killed me!”	286.76198884893483
“Murder!” screamed Patrick.	275.81331266976014
Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door	230.42133609616354
free, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said, the	249.9484301217818
deputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as	267.05044588219795
possible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he	191.96675991988909
met Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained	365.80441923054843
with blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat,	215.85527070731666
crying, “I knew it! I guessed it! But too late by a minute,	314.70567979014925
unfortunate, unfortunate that I am!”	181.58217519793394
Felton made no resistance. Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of	290.0970125612065
the guards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little	225.25926203737941
terrace commanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the duke’s	174.88452436768225
chamber.	223.2766134846202
At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom	244.90109337765915
Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber.	269.94980081474756
He found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the	339.0026308955652
wound.	283.52212288750354
“Laporte,” said the duke, in a dying voice, “Laporte, do you come from	295.98331113790584
her?”	240.4787567533881
“Yes, monseigneur,” replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of	287.4845846972884
Austria, “but too late, perhaps.”	182.31294434786577
“Silence, Laporte, you may be overheard. Patrick, let no one enter. Oh,	219.75027454255024
I cannot tell what she says to me! My God, I am dying!”	296.9219381863264
And the duke swooned.	287.06506735848586
Meanwhile, Lord de Winter, the deputies, the leaders of the expedition,	201.99713860769248
the officers of Buckingham’s household, had all made their way into the	262.40004142458275
chamber. Cries of despair resounded on all sides. The news, which	266.35460599450414
filled the palace with tears and groans, soon became known, and spread	352.5136714747975
itself throughout the city.	270.32469475045065
The report of a cannon announced that something new and unexpected had	361.74870566203333
taken place.	172.02249366291014
Lord de Winter tore his hair.	243.00767193146106
“Too late by a minute!” cried he, “too late by a minute! Oh, my God, my	316.49616800007254
God! what a misfortune!”	352.84982475298915
He had been informed at seven o’clock in the morning that a rope ladder	191.89720715638566
floated from one of the windows of the castle; he had hastened to	174.40341032192185
Milady’s chamber, had found it empty, the window open, and the bars	180.90612982848262
filed, had remembered the verbal caution D’Artagnan had transmitted to	170.66418269878878
him by his messenger, had trembled for the duke, and running to the	207.61798173527785
stable without taking time to have a horse saddled, had jumped upon the	227.77193561930426
first he found, had galloped off like the wind, had alighted below in	343.3156200950353
the courtyard, had ascended the stairs precipitately, and on the top	348.86550512056937
step, as we have said, had encountered Felton.	167.75678471291508
The duke, however, was not dead. He recovered a little, reopened his	269.5928389188909
eyes, and hope revived in all hearts.	289.05241128787964
“Gentlemen,” said he, “leave me alone with Patrick and Laporte—ah, is	185.42169664181682
that you, De Winter? You sent me a strange madman this morning! See the	326.50925624361287
state in which he has put me.”	311.9675376324858
“Oh, my Lord!” cried the baron, “I shall never console myself.”	332.68872008084736
“And you would be quite wrong, my dear De Winter,” said Buckingham,	365.6157306472317
holding out his hand to him. “I do not know the man who deserves being	318.9348844368512
regretted during the whole life of another man; but leave us, I pray	312.5041098009502
you.”	191.01322545793795
The baron went out sobbing.	178.33461292795147
There only remained in the closet of the wounded duke Laporte and	199.52682310387775
Patrick. A physician was sought for, but none was yet found.	303.2125185093098
“You will live, my Lord, you will live!” repeated the faithful servant	245.04458548238824
of Anne of Austria, on his knees before the duke’s sofa.	242.71249961206192
“What has she written to me?” said Buckingham, feebly, streaming with	345.959547174726
blood, and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved, “what has	248.47921558423758
she written to me? Read me her letter.”	172.05522701288425
“Oh, my Lord!” said Laporte.	324.1656097494913
“Obey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?”	219.51120915025734
Laporte broke the seal, and placed the paper before the eyes of the	178.17744176496456
duke; but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing.	177.752270366389
“Read!” said he, “read! I cannot see. Read, then! For soon, perhaps, I	167.58130257782773
shall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to	253.7864715123712
me.”	334.33331810610923
Laporte made no further objection, and read:	193.71805109808108
“MY LORD, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you	274.3435736956741
and for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to	312.182569896142
countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against	276.4995063355758
France, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is	302.80361902854884
the ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your	167.60004641915833
love for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great	317.3799573675942
catastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord,	362.6231619941416
for which I should never console myself.	226.82926948559225
    “Be careful of your life, which is menaced, and which will be dear	337.9403638845208
    to me from the moment I am not obliged to see an enemy in you.	219.89295652155852
“Your affectionate	286.6224964341849
“ANNE”	295.1349657597857
Buckingham collected all his remaining strength to listen to the	185.2416303610466
reading of the letter; then, when it was ended, as if he had met with a	272.2464037344022
bitter disappointment, he asked, “Have you nothing else to say to me by	187.61731023191805
the living voice, Laporte?”	226.53558354419715
“The queen charged me to tell you to watch over yourself, for she had	249.6324021126896
advice that your assassination would be attempted.”	176.3317470153243
“And is that all—is that all?” replied Buckingham, impatiently.	355.36323838498015
“She likewise charged me to tell you that she still loved you.”	291.9512953653528
“Ah,” said Buckingham, “God be praised! My death, then, will not be to	237.68740471616263
her as the death of a stranger!”	274.58286574473743
Laporte burst into tears.	242.6394127918296
“Patrick,” said the duke, “bring me the casket in which the diamond	241.76040351286943
studs were kept.”	260.7653199654733
Patrick brought the object desired, which Laporte recognized as having	327.9767157406929
belonged to the queen.	315.5281004063147
“Now the scent bag of white satin, on which her cipher is embroidered	251.03115560903947
in pearls.”	191.65071740701964
Patrick again obeyed.	218.94930982406623
“Here, Laporte,” said Buckingham, “these are the only tokens I ever	249.50911254719423
received from her—this silver casket and these two letters. You will	258.2028754265245
restore them to her Majesty; and as a last memorial”—he looked round	193.62789855180182
for some valuable object—“you will add—”	324.1038965877209
He still sought; but his eyes, darkened by death, encountered only the	178.85436218751522
knife which had fallen from the hand of Felton, still smoking with the	344.9008104245651
blood spread over its blade.	297.75362474497524
“And you will add to them this knife,” said the duke, pressing the hand	196.85446860534574
of Laporte. He had just strength enough to place the scent bag at the	173.01365995234508
bottom of the silver casket, and to let the knife fall into it, making	226.1975330806775
a sign to Laporte that he was no longer able to speak; then, in a last	290.20044515702716
convulsion, which this time he had not the power to combat, he slipped	340.3968561719918
from the sofa to the floor.	325.5678306731314
Patrick uttered a loud cry.	282.4292156901345
Buckingham tried to smile a last time; but death checked his thought,	192.8611292276275
which remained engraved on his brow like a last kiss of love.	171.01195734138597
At this moment the duke’s surgeon arrived, quite terrified; he was	314.72470534758975
already on board the admiral’s ship, where they had been obliged to	329.07952821733363
seek him.	228.20040833808463
He approached the duke, took his hand, held it for an instant in his	337.79930284166966
own, and letting it fall, “All is useless,” said he, “he is dead.”	194.97147802853422
“Dead, dead!” cried Patrick.	203.94719632881737
At this cry all the crowd re-entered the apartment, and throughout the	283.46518893244166
palace and town there was nothing but consternation and tumult.	282.1708892574253
As soon as Lord de Winter saw Buckingham was dead, he ran to Felton,	241.99912600028225
whom the soldiers still guarded on the terrace of the palace.	321.2234001691637
“Wretch!” said he to the young man, who since the death of Buckingham	311.65197111527476
had regained that coolness and self-possession which never after	306.2583920050524
abandoned him, “wretch! what have you done?”	166.82428519866625
“I have avenged myself!” said he.	292.15526096312226
“Avenged yourself,” said the baron. “Rather say that you have served as	239.96719470643438
an instrument to that accursed woman; but I swear to you that this	168.52391133568045
crime shall be her last.”	180.76538089356265
“I don’t know what you mean,” replied Felton, quietly, “and I am	211.96152329813123
ignorant of whom you are speaking, my Lord. I killed the Duke of	211.8596246257115
Buckingham because he twice refused you yourself to appoint me captain;	189.02592727874253
I have punished him for his injustice, that is all.”	285.4733457177565
De Winter, stupefied, looked on while the soldiers bound Felton, and	182.8492193415851
could not tell what to think of such insensibility.	326.68121064482455
One thing alone, however, threw a shade over the pallid brow of Felton.	218.07517210678566
At every noise he heard, the simple Puritan fancied he recognized the	264.7240844923872
step and voice of Milady coming to throw herself into his arms, to	330.2470247441331
accuse herself, and die with him.	263.1284202343741
All at once he started. His eyes became fixed upon a point of the sea,	226.6021593252484
commanded by the terrace where he was. With the eagle glance of a	290.16972505110016
sailor he had recognized there, where another would have seen only a	246.13488908889985
gull hovering over the waves, the sail of a sloop which was directed	283.1398269654407
toward the coast of France.	223.2946480918293
He grew deadly pale, placed his hand upon his heart, which was	227.91147791202587
breaking, and at once perceived all the treachery.	216.69417670656537
“One last favor, my Lord!” said he to the baron.	222.46549652212656
“What?” asked his Lordship.	346.6083299652097
“What o’clock is it?”	227.05848928502567
The baron drew out his watch. “It wants ten minutes to nine,” said he.	193.18722090337243
Milady had hastened her departure by an hour and a half. As soon as she	352.7616364460641
heard the cannon which announced the fatal event, she had ordered the	255.7286003721769
anchor to be weighed. The vessel was making way under a blue sky, at	317.3821340475405
great distance from the coast.	341.11513664862514
“God has so willed it!” said he, with the resignation of a fanatic; but	258.7261298607615
without, however, being able to take his eyes from that ship, on board	304.15634327328866
of which he doubtless fancied he could distinguish the white outline of	236.06042869701832
her to whom he had sacrificed his life.	215.62779151981684
De Winter followed his look, observed his feelings, and guessed all.	289.48128447974887
“Be punished _alone_, for the first, miserable man!” said Lord de	332.935435922174
Winter to Felton, who was being dragged away with his eyes turned	362.99183737767146
toward the sea; “but I swear to you by the memory of my brother whom I	227.1961012771189
have loved so much that your accomplice is not saved.”	227.97159272068257
Felton lowered his head without pronouncing a syllable.	192.2186352034562
As to Lord de Winter, he descended the stairs rapidly, and went	275.35291982104
straight to the port.	208.47709056630492
Chapter LX.	281.47633890069346
IN FRANCE	209.287366853507
The first fear of the King of England, Charles I., on learning of the	358.79428377780204
death of the duke, was that such terrible news might discourage the	203.18905248902334
Rochellais; he tried, says Richelieu in his _Memoirs_, to conceal it	277.2220617514523
from them as long as possible, closing all the ports of his kingdom,	280.28299441227085
and carefully keeping watch that no vessel should sail until the army	208.56942265524776
which Buckingham was getting together had gone, taking upon himself, in	190.5977617187916
default of Buckingham, to superintend the departure.	359.2938147182144
He carried the strictness of this order so far as to detain in England	218.20054629477747
the ambassadors of Denmark, who had taken their leave, and the regular	186.64337299062885
ambassador of Holland, who was to take back to the port of Flushing the	222.3026508407187
Indian merchantmen of which Charles I. had made restitution to the	320.7219776637956
United Provinces.	252.7861093554372
But as he did not think of giving this order till five hours after the	289.3503011531915
event—that is to say, till two o’clock in the afternoon—two vessels had	178.33368131131638
already left the port, the one bearing, as we know, Milady, who,	339.8636478414215
already anticipating the event, was further confirmed in that belief by	167.61144550506228
seeing the black flag flying at the masthead of the admiral’s ship.	252.4701612889938
As to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and	359.8543275559862
how it set sail.	334.83002517894727
During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only	167.59360450095315
the king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in	193.74855382577752
camp than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of	189.8525878216252
St. Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort	285.8408228942946
of only twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of	298.427055773202
the king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his	184.8284928832137
royal lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of	302.7242387234776
September.	356.4885938196582
M. de Tréville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his	243.6519842947993
portmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire	320.18425349803147
and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris,	259.0627656123803
it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the	219.04607899602723
escort.	286.86233583966657
The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de	198.60907796541215
Tréville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it. It was	170.79879993894693
then that D’Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred	305.54914252781816
upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers—for without that	274.3508160354736
circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his	217.35212584533724
companions left it.	269.94644830542046
It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had	363.0393587797936
for a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the	276.66478837733075
convent of Béthune with Milady, her mortal enemy. Aramis therefore had	239.52424049351742
written immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had	179.45416122475893
such fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme.	168.36944022749324
Bonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or	319.6633921550015
Belgium. They had not long to wait for an answer. Eight or ten days	281.427946268834
afterward Aramis received the following letter:	271.1485211776271
“MY DEAR COUSIN, Here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw	206.64965489062288
our little servant from the convent of Béthune, the air of which you	344.3632099381641
think is bad for her. My sister sends you this authorization with great	241.52082838256058
pleasure, for she is very partial to the little girl, to whom she	359.4909831043397
intends to be more serviceable hereafter.	169.22067106908136
“I salute you,	288.4401004327725
“MARIE MICHON”	207.27946034604787
To this letter was added an order, conceived in these terms:	211.64589783298737
“At the Louvre, August 10, 1628	331.1138107229051
“The superior of the convent of Béthune will place in the hands of the	243.18999054013653
person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the	247.54926376544597
convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage.	340.9601171250905
“ANNE”	228.99795588718317
It may be easily imagined how the relationship between Aramis and a	174.18063961566048
seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but	322.10179779704305
Aramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his	195.96096070189694
eyes at the gross pleasantry of Porthos, begged his friends not to	257.6344449740303
revert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was	179.73215894017247
said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to	316.81597156909305
interfere in such affairs.	188.50668321733116
There was no further question, therefore, about Marie Michon among the	347.09686498018027
four Musketeers, who besides had what they wanted: that was, the order	228.7279738234757
to withdraw Mme. Bonacieux from the convent of the Carmelites of	206.22480746250008
Béthune. It was true that this order would not be of great use to them	190.44357548269383
while they were in camp at La Rochelle; that is to say, at the other	324.84757219277355
end of France. Therefore D’Artagnan was going to ask leave of absence	235.69654310455047
of M. de Tréville, confiding to him candidly the importance of his	246.20130708752686
departure, when the news was transmitted to him as well as to his three	252.3076648413647
friends that the king was about to set out for Paris with an escort of	318.08819356991955
twenty Musketeers, and that they formed part of the escort.	341.2651801943872
Their joy was great. The lackeys were sent on before with the baggage,	318.80119360186916
and they set out on the morning of the sixteenth.	166.0438111039113
The cardinal accompanied his Majesty from Surgères to Mauzes; and there	167.04499470868012
the king and his minister took leave of each other with great	174.97187127013922
demonstrations of friendship.	306.4504459949684
The king, however, who sought distraction, while traveling as fast as	251.78094879085802
possible—for he was anxious to be in Paris by the twenty-third—stopped	187.0000744920887
from time to time to fly the magpie, a pastime for which the taste had	183.5118173547527
been formerly inspired in him by de Luynes, and for which he had always	331.63075676900485
preserved a great predilection. Out of the twenty Musketeers sixteen,	196.8426939929207
when this took place, rejoiced greatly at this relaxation; but the	264.65151390720933
other four cursed it heartily. D’Artagnan, in particular, had a	178.8636605243687
perpetual buzzing in his ears, which Porthos explained thus: “A very	229.0056617886593
great lady has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you	191.40183593453577
somewhere.”	285.95801366304585
At length the escort passed through Paris on the twenty-third, in the	312.7361997439681
night. The king thanked M. de Tréville, and permitted him to distribute	276.34635898720273
furloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should	239.3416606630328
not appear in any public place, under penalty of the Bastille.	238.88956656899057
The first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four	267.9683730626082
friends. Still further, Athos obtained of M. de Tréville six days	312.080093329326
instead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights—for	238.60899573084117
they set out on the twenty-fourth at five o’clock in the evening, and	265.58376621082766
as a further kindness M. de Tréville post-dated the leave to the	316.9928687130516
morning of the twenty-fifth.	169.83412669519558
“Good Lord!” said D’Artagnan, who, as we have often said, never	324.2236988846452
stumbled at anything. “It appears to me that we are making a great	189.61360387009043
trouble of a very simple thing. In two days, and by using up two or	171.29214724589187
three horses (that’s nothing; I have plenty of money), I am at Béthune.	283.75407663403655
I present my letter from the queen to the superior, and I bring back	217.00791749286662
the dear treasure I go to seek—not into Lorraine, not into Belgium, but	260.9565698582512
to Paris, where she will be much better concealed, particularly while	276.9801758176894
the cardinal is at La Rochelle. Well, once returned from the country,	300.30841625722667
half by the protection of her cousin, half through what we have	284.3417364326122
personally done for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire.	249.79502083519532
Remain, then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless	174.1857179957476
fatigue. Myself and Planchet are all that such a simple expedition	234.56003488522413
requires.”	166.4206646304528
To this Athos replied quietly: “We also have money left—for I have not	251.52641387492508
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and Porthos and Aramis have not	312.3059908952726
eaten all theirs. We can therefore use up four horses as well as one.	283.95934868931465
But consider, D’Artagnan,” added he, in a tone so solemn that it made	259.0958510232122
the young man shudder, “consider that Béthune is a city where the	213.83352893068297
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings	272.30785578447814
misery with her. If you had only to deal with four men, D’Artagnan, I	243.58153496651573
would allow you to go alone. You have to do with that woman! We four	220.01322845470847
will go; and I hope to God that with our four lackeys we may be in	317.7519243609685
sufficient number.”	237.78501711398405
“You terrify me, Athos!” cried D’Artagnan. “My God! what do you fear?”	254.29741873169473
“Everything!” replied Athos.	221.7408173261521
D’Artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like	272.8059381961374
that of Athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued	349.37728565034155
their route as fast as their horses could carry them, but without	182.8111162337736
adding another word.	328.5938993678552
On the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering Arras, and as	324.0171686755865
D’Artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the Golden Harrow to drink a	311.4915769416334
glass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just	365.35886724991184
had a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the	300.101757704998
road to Paris. At the moment he passed through the gateway into the	310.50111862511835
street, the wind blew open the cloak in which he was wrapped, although	331.45701096257665
it was in the month of August, and lifted his hat, which the traveler	357.1833597986984
seized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it	344.12502079752016
eagerly over his eyes.	299.5154766298103
D’Artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and	263.9955564405692
let his glass fall.	176.55077542847903
“What is the matter, monsieur?” said Planchet. “Oh, come, gentlemen, my	185.10845673845375
master is ill!”	198.40755522990688
The three friends hastened toward D’Artagnan, who, instead of being	263.4896198383992
ill, ran toward his horse. They stopped him at the door.	226.54173239228817
“Well, where the devil are you going now?” cried Athos.	343.30567296513277
“It is he!” cried D’Artagnan, pale with anger, and with the sweat on	211.91745670065905
his brow, “it is he! let me overtake him!”	238.1803768918382
“He? What he?” asked Athos.	220.73383686268775
“He, that man!”	319.39198209746513
“What man?”	176.09766082178356
“That cursed man, my evil genius, whom I have always met with when	355.9321420442425
threatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman	303.0343469367383
when I met her for the first time, he whom I was seeking when I	334.1190075406314
offended our Athos, he whom I saw on the very morning Madame Bonacieux	347.4311352336216
was abducted. I have seen him; that is he! I recognized him when the	329.686781828732
wind blew upon his cloak.”	334.1294118363456
“The devil!” said Athos, musingly.	197.72560704720772
“To saddle, gentlemen! to saddle! Let us pursue him, and we shall	323.60730568386276
overtake him!”	241.3812989278844
“My dear friend,” said Aramis, “remember that he goes in an opposite	319.8341676411108
direction from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse,	177.88680131328715
and ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without	174.6142196141952
even a chance of overtaking him. Let the man go, D’Artagnan; let us	202.83004453503798
save the woman.”	264.31395726547186
“Monsieur, monsieur!” cried a hostler, running out and looking after	358.13968310587006
the stranger, “monsieur, here is a paper which dropped out of your hat!	348.2467837710516
Eh, monsieur, eh!”	205.66957989445086
“Friend,” said D’Artagnan, “a half-pistole for that paper!”	169.74114633718648
“My faith, monsieur, with great pleasure! Here it is!”	334.42337972691234
The hostler, enchanted with the good day’s work he had done, returned	225.8499045728289
to the yard. D’Artagnan unfolded the paper.	312.0214750062644
“Well?” eagerly demanded all his three friends.	248.19785380148235
“Nothing but one word!” said D’Artagnan.	187.32937081535215
“Yes,” said Aramis, “but that one word is the name of some town or	278.47023607718387
village.”	344.35005504740934
“_Armentières_,” read Porthos; “Armentières? I don’t know such a	178.78833593565216
place.”	288.64056215153283
“And that name of a town or village is written in her hand!” cried	293.97399232507877
Athos.	362.67188164465347
“Come on, come on!” said D’Artagnan; “let us keep that paper carefully,	321.7935145520366
perhaps I have not thrown away my half-pistole. To horse, my friends,	166.31602791595176
to horse!”	284.335581216773
And the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to Béthune.	266.459358706471
Chapter LXI.	345.9032325844262
THE CARMELITE CONVENT AT BÉTHUNE	233.59327724230295
Great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes	215.61915356034848
them surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to	251.15780298582195
the moment which a wearied Providence has marked as the rock of their	340.86627895022093
impious fortunes.	197.17924209618596
It was thus with Milady. She escaped the cruisers of both nations, and	185.26165658724574
arrived at Boulogne without accident.	228.09144254794498
When landing at Portsmouth, Milady was an Englishwoman whom the	320.9370063291789
persecutions of the French drove from La Rochelle; when landing at	280.72238041296146
Boulogne, after a two days’ passage, she passed for a Frenchwoman whom	282.72491319297956
the English persecuted at Portsmouth out of their hatred for France.	223.58840795413312
Milady had, likewise, the best of passports—her beauty, her noble	345.08959029997925
appearance, and the liberality with which she distributed her pistoles.	182.42691436440234
Freed from the usual formalities by the affable smile and gallant	199.3356489869106
manners of an old governor of the port, who kissed her hand, she only	214.67510136226474
remained long enough at Boulogne to put into the post a letter,	308.37047449535555
conceived in the following terms:	252.97694926337462
“_To his Eminence Monseigneur the Cardinal Richelieu, in his camp	279.2334712978944
before La Rochelle_.	265.3385466924343
“MONSEIGNEUR, Let your Eminence be reassured. His Grace the Duke of	285.5626134109675
Buckingham _will not set out_ for France.	270.8320404751866
“MILADY DE ——	290.4418084318438
“BOULOGNE, evening of the twenty-fifth.	201.6507000345694
“P.S.—According to the desire of your Eminence, I report to the convent	188.5170039095858
of the Carmelites at Béthune, where I will await your orders.”	190.21008657786342
Accordingly, that same evening Milady commenced her journey. Night	244.82550985070668
overtook her; she stopped, and slept at an inn. At five o’clock the	277.66608610403335
next morning she again proceeded, and in three hours after entered	318.2252248706179
Béthune. She inquired for the convent of the Carmelites, and went	269.7790617941939
thither immediately.	195.695660869244
The superior met her; Milady showed her the cardinal’s order. The	194.91493086249744
abbess assigned her a chamber, and had breakfast served.	324.9546207276007
All the past was effaced from the eyes of this woman; and her looks,	293.808915952911
fixed on the future, beheld nothing but the high fortunes reserved for	359.7908802349711
her by the cardinal, whom she had so successfully served without his	341.9083405857911
name being in any way mixed up with the sanguinary affair. The ever-new	228.16528928096008
passions which consumed her gave to her life the appearance of those	356.0816206023221
clouds which float in the heavens, reflecting sometimes azure,	189.1498989233847
sometimes fire, sometimes the opaque blackness of the tempest, and	169.04913381874678
which leave no traces upon the earth behind them but devastation and	203.73670585919734
death.	214.60029073180357
After breakfast, the abbess came to pay her a visit. There is very	188.48476135761956
little amusement in the cloister, and the good superior was eager to	182.06272071343037
make the acquaintance of her new boarder.	200.63891434492666
Milady wished to please the abbess. This was a very easy matter for a	357.2690768035463
woman so really superior as she was. She tried to be agreeable, and she	249.0737188794839
was charming, winning the good superior by her varied conversation and	304.44526695995216
by the graces of her whole personality.	187.81167260698507
The abbess, who was the daughter of a noble house, took particular	314.82133464157175
delight in stories of the court, which so seldom travel to the	257.8675386067362
extremities of the kingdom, and which, above all, have so much	346.3811294152897
difficulty in penetrating the walls of convents, at whose threshold the	325.3379055166754
noise of the world dies away.	337.7029992723164
Milady, on the contrary, was quite conversant with all aristocratic	352.95487744555635
intrigues, amid which she had constantly lived for five or six years.	277.7925566996049
She made it her business, therefore, to amuse the good abbess with the	166.20937308566934
worldly practices of the court of France, mixed with the eccentric	262.62683154360514
pursuits of the king; she made for her the scandalous chronicle of the	267.44123152862517
lords and ladies of the court, whom the abbess knew perfectly by name,	190.0506080341019
touched lightly on the amours of the queen and the Duke of Buckingham,	187.80450939148673
talking a great deal to induce her auditor to talk a little.	200.41307250835
But the abbess contented herself with listening and smiling without	290.9677397363942
replying a word. Milady, however, saw that this sort of narrative	195.34640212658778
amused her very much, and kept at it; only she now let her conversation	318.37700718948395
drift toward the cardinal.	242.83261201872634
But she was greatly embarrassed. She did not know whether the abbess	272.26551846854835
was a royalist or a cardinalist; she therefore confined herself to a	270.4292875933007
prudent middle course. But the abbess, on her part, maintained a	283.3520527586187
reserve still more prudent, contenting herself with making a profound	233.06070911942817
inclination of the head every time the fair traveler pronounced the	183.12453554283562
name of his Eminence.	179.25328303673567
Milady began to think she should soon grow weary of a convent life; she	290.68555113974287
resolved, then, to risk something in order that she might know how to	226.21376296205204
act afterward. Desirous of seeing how far the discretion of the good	246.27376759403415
abbess would go, she began to tell a story, obscure at first, but very	249.20466706623523
circumstantial afterward, about the cardinal, relating the amours of	282.3337823711753
the minister with Mme. d’Aiguillon, Marion de Lorme, and several other	233.84575584585878
gay women.	297.67405361356714
The abbess listened more attentively, grew animated by degrees, and	255.3362441812004
smiled.	336.08702163144596
“Good,” thought Milady; “she takes a pleasure in my conversation. If	353.3492586237712
she is a cardinalist, she has no fanaticism, at least.”	324.98797012342186
She then went on to describe the persecutions exercised by the cardinal	278.2694047104388
upon his enemies. The abbess only crossed herself, without approving or	343.1685226138154
disapproving.	358.5794105374912
This confirmed Milady in her opinion that the abbess was rather	340.7664531211786
royalist than cardinalist. Milady therefore continued, coloring her	317.839223748894
narrations more and more.	246.50714612480982
“I am very ignorant of these matters,” said the abbess, at length; “but	340.0982396311841
however distant from the court we may be, however remote from the	272.95000018283554
interests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of	276.6134939284625
what you have related. And one of our boarders has suffered much from	248.37997872791846
the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal!”	194.41206397811564
“One of your boarders?” said Milady; “oh, my God! Poor woman! I pity	352.02519429365236
her, then.”	326.5264334322812
“And you have reason, for she is much to be pitied. Imprisonment,	197.28485232817738
menaces, ill treatment—she has suffered everything. But after all,”	209.41568874781825
resumed the abbess, “Monsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives	331.14946843760686
for acting thus; and though she has the look of an angel, we must not	319.8535604703077
always judge people by the appearance.”	268.90124759804166
“Good!” said Milady to herself; “who knows! I am about, perhaps, to	309.7374443858927
discover something here; I am in the vein.”	258.7998570998989
She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor.	339.5596481638269
“Alas,” said Milady, “I know it is so. It is said that we must not	236.46184548570966
trust to the face; but in what, then, shall we place confidence, if not	271.36970752474804
in the most beautiful work of the Lord? As for me, I shall be deceived	186.68410548243958
all my life perhaps, but I shall always have faith in a person whose	200.9491694089073
countenance inspires me with sympathy.”	321.8793589986698
“You would, then, be tempted to believe,” said the abbess, “that this	320.2180334081353
young person is innocent?”	238.78392647023438
“The cardinal pursues not only crimes,” said she: “there are certain	168.13732165179883
virtues which he pursues more severely than certain offenses.”	230.6666850581907
“Permit me, madame, to express my surprise,” said the abbess.	262.3036756963338
“At what?” said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness.	354.436968884424
“At the language you use.”	266.6250457161871
“What do you find so astonishing in that language?” said Milady,	271.71445797286106
smiling.	234.7180770974101
“You are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet—”	206.1397796122747
“And yet I speak ill of him,” replied Milady, finishing the thought of	332.2452478175155
the superior.	204.74665707313116
“At least you don’t speak well of him.”	293.09273307881426
“That is because I am not his friend,” said she, sighing, “but his	176.17998224996074
victim!”	315.9006077676006
“But this letter in which he recommends you to me?”	265.07042977516875
“Is an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which	231.0122677160148
he will release me by one of his satellites.”	257.0432756581459
“But why have you not fled?”	298.81068948107105
“Whither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which	243.72266406841285
the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his	194.35283027002475
hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a	304.80465520102064
woman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?”	310.3197658578837
“No, that is true; but she—that is another thing; I believe she is	273.19962892793353
detained in France by some love affair.”	169.38247894375255
“Ah,” said Milady, with a sigh, “if she loves she is not altogether	299.00879073188855
wretched.”	286.49894554293877
“Then,” said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, “I	269.78247802624804
behold another poor victim?”	285.8256240529313
“Alas, yes,” said Milady.	227.03939713003354
The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh	173.8752560483935
thought suggested itself to her mind.	267.17727387461986
“You are not an enemy of our holy faith?” said she, hesitatingly.	365.84091647763876
“Who—I?” cried Milady; “I a Protestant? Oh, no! I call to witness the	267.5281614966574
God who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!”	262.78364995186826
“Then, madame,” said the abbess, smiling, “be reassured; the house in	344.98168053628194
which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in	292.5281200525973
our power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here,	253.2008358680435
moreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt,	185.21660129949817
in consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and	199.89462139901346
well-behaved.”	242.79913479255487
“What is her name?”	237.8145400030839
“She was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I	292.92075804847997
have not tried to discover her other name.”	195.49521948027535
“Kitty!” cried Milady. “What? Are you sure?”	326.6205225486223
“That she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?”	195.17451793650517
Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that	286.9149764851635
this might be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the	274.7618163507323
remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of	297.9107454064624
vengeance disordered the features of Milady, which, however,	307.79669298226656
immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this	191.19380995180452
woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose.	361.82845152870505
“And when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a	258.90786210430167
sympathy?” asked Milady.	208.75219718760448
“Why, this evening,” said the abbess; “today even. But you have been	181.8693176399215
traveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you	317.8204663659063
rose at five o’clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and	277.54490620740717
sleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.”	221.13670429625296
Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained	255.27557713104778
as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her	261.2101553053957
heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the	201.4996757298332
offer of the superior. During the last fifteen days she had experienced	271.1744309828225
so many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still	358.39824708060075
capable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.	269.1914510553692
She therefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked	237.39650001901057
by the ideas of vengeance which the name of Kitty had naturally brought	222.56703809477744
to her thoughts. She remembered that almost unlimited promise which the	353.3106242494713
cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. She had	267.59200558093767
succeeded; D’Artagnan was then in her power!	297.6988801891438
One thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her	356.37076115256605
husband, the Comte de la Fère, whom she had believed dead, or at least	306.5419230824622
expatriated, and whom she found again in Athos—the best friend of	178.94872422541974
D’Artagnan.	219.7945413171707
But alas, if he was the friend of D’Artagnan, he must have lent him his	345.55525020522816
assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated	199.38740053053098
the project of his Eminence; if he was the friend of D’Artagnan, he was	307.51013227717647
the enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving	240.77532407617707
him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young Musketeer.	274.15737803401976
All these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for Milady; so, rocked by	322.04688529094034
them, she soon fell asleep.	320.6102831699578
She was awakened by a soft voice which sounded at the foot of her bed.	173.2709173877974
She opened her eyes, and saw the abbess, accompanied by a young woman	326.4584550618864
with light hair and delicate complexion, who fixed upon her a look full	174.9440151900054
of benevolent curiosity.	181.32592438757115
The face of the young woman was entirely unknown to her. Each examined	357.89916163887654
the other with great attention, while exchanging the customary	317.30469260326714
compliments; both were very handsome, but of quite different styles of	271.13382796018055
beauty. Milady, however, smiled in observing that she excelled the	339.1671015729321
young woman by far in her high air and aristocratic bearing. It is true	326.0204673392012
that the habit of a novice, which the young woman wore, was not very	364.8862978697431
advantageous in a contest of this kind.	357.74017816472826
The abbess introduced them to each other. When this formality was	299.43206599472956
ended, as her duties called her to chapel, she left the two young women	226.60926208837682
alone.	323.2598215929024
The novice, seeing Milady in bed, was about to follow the example of	247.77572938263864
the superior; but Milady stopped her.	242.80802980817867
“How, madame,” said she, “I have scarcely seen you, and you already	197.53155929284014
wish to deprive me of your company, upon which I had counted a little,	204.83944626214486
I must confess, for the time I have to pass here?”	320.24447497783433
“No, madame,” replied the novice, “only I thought I had chosen my time	339.6223116086201
ill; you were asleep, you are fatigued.”	313.34573967963547
“Well,” said Milady, “what can those who sleep wish for—a happy	335.026104015338
awakening? This awakening you have given me; allow me, then, to enjoy	188.9594742322827
it at my ease,” and taking her hand, she drew her toward the armchair	316.3935935537521
by the bedside.	324.89543881985514
The novice sat down.	270.85498588242586
“How unfortunate I am!” said she; “I have been here six months without	200.27705554697434
the shadow of recreation. You arrive, and your presence was likely to	268.48415552500387
afford me delightful company; yet I expect, in all probability, to quit	312.1997483793909
the convent at any moment.”	199.8768771914838
“How, you are going soon?” asked Milady.	188.0454986826102
“At least I hope so,” said the novice, with an expression of joy which	316.187417808913
she made no effort to disguise.	228.67583215908854
“I think I learned you had suffered persecutions from the cardinal,”	285.1188415144548
continued Milady; “that would have been another motive for sympathy	301.3619806679294
between us.”	339.1725824821592
“What I have heard, then, from our good mother is true; you have	318.83004122331624
likewise been a victim of that wicked priest.”	172.75663031290182
“Hush!” said Milady; “let us not, even here, speak thus of him. All my	351.44641035241307
misfortunes arise from my having said nearly what you have said before	364.67179163691503
a woman whom I thought my friend, and who betrayed me. Are you also the	222.97392471568278
victim of a treachery?”	173.63095255323645
“No,” said the novice, “but of my devotion—of a devotion to a woman I	191.7468872506033
loved, for whom I would have laid down my life, for whom I would give	209.73289646114046
it still.”	291.9615724836347
“And who has abandoned you—is that it?”	289.2779826650681
“I have been sufficiently unjust to believe so; but during the last two	351.7302382217356
or three days I have obtained proof to the contrary, for which I thank	277.44299086915765
God—for it would have cost me very dear to think she had forgotten me.	358.88066648507026
But you, madame, you appear to be free,” continued the novice; “and if	300.10507517445535
you were inclined to fly it only rests with yourself to do so.”	297.6729766304493
“Whither would you have me go, without friends, without money, in a	196.4219089400492
part of France with which I am unacquainted, and where I have never	283.58821526414636
been before?”	203.05138269260144
“Oh,” cried the novice, “as to friends, you would have them wherever	179.6186512014351
you want, you appear so good and are so beautiful!”	264.48717479872494
“That does not prevent,” replied Milady, softening her smile so as to	172.14369901716358
give it an angelic expression, “my being alone or being persecuted.”	317.5747777880615
“Hear me,” said the novice; “we must trust in heaven. There always	362.3431329673459
comes a moment when the good you have done pleads your cause before	321.55009830695906
God; and see, perhaps it is a happiness for you, humble and powerless	342.7293691803318
as I am, that you have met with me, for if I leave this place, well—I	175.47352491718084
have powerful friends, who, after having exerted themselves on my	179.06725682352533
account, may also exert themselves for you.”	297.885147685139
“Oh, when I said I was alone,” said Milady, hoping to make the novice	285.0745347456702
talk by talking of herself, “it is not for want of friends in high	260.78845653095624
places; but these friends themselves tremble before the cardinal. The	359.08435394861255
queen herself does not dare to oppose the terrible minister. I have	283.1522301705714
proof that her Majesty, notwithstanding her excellent heart, has more	245.39671003357103
than once been obliged to abandon to the anger of his Eminence persons	187.55580159112566
who had served her.”	326.21674534979076
“Trust me, madame; the queen may appear to have abandoned those	236.13307606846922
persons, but we must not put faith in appearances. The more they are	273.3018046769791
persecuted, the more she thinks of them; and often, when they least	352.90683233096485
expect it, they have proof of a kind remembrance.”	224.5447691756835
“Alas!” said Milady, “I believe so; the queen is so good!”	166.20502439736833
“Oh, you know her, then, that lovely and noble queen, that you speak of	178.68231434777894
her thus!” cried the novice, with enthusiasm.	270.66706886060183
“That is to say,” replied Milady, driven into her entrenchment, “that I	279.90600206797575
have not the honor of knowing her personally; but I know a great number	334.600750070354
of her most intimate friends. I am acquainted with Monsieur de Putange;	233.17284762927412
I met Monsieur Dujart in England; I know Monsieur de Tréville.”	241.93575377619493
“Monsieur de Tréville!” exclaimed the novice, “do you know Monsieur de	245.23121275769716
Tréville?”	350.44128019983054
“Yes, perfectly well—intimately even.”	315.55216313363644
“The captain of the king’s Musketeers?”	185.6088870021758
“The captain of the king’s Musketeers.”	262.34112747469885
“Why, then, only see!” cried the novice; “we shall soon be well	169.91492073497065
acquainted, almost friends. If you know Monsieur de Tréville, you must	247.87169024806167
have visited him?”	272.69744855354736
“Often!” said Milady, who, having entered this track, and perceiving	323.4989938543507
that falsehood succeeded, was determined to follow it to the end.	281.9939262290709
“With him, then, you must have seen some of his Musketeers?”	247.82881552765951
“All those he is in the habit of receiving!” replied Milady, for whom	174.09124832610104
this conversation began to have a real interest.	178.53872550018755
“Name a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my	240.22442483571447
friends.”	348.1927374764563
“Well!” said Milady, embarrassed, “I know Monsieur de Louvigny,	180.7955848809222
Monsieur de Courtivron, Monsieur de Ferussac.”	339.0522433287706
The novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, “Don’t	272.5911355469173
you know a gentleman named Athos?”	332.62545881566393
Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and	200.52872246688733
mistress as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing	315.69736557634656
the hand of the novice, and devouring her with looks.	304.7782528192172
“What is the matter? Good God!” asked the poor woman, “have I said	249.55862617237398
anything that has wounded you?”	170.6977643498062
“No; but the name struck me, because I also have known that gentleman,	242.36992936522927
and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know	256.03520152155033
him well.”	311.9330971658131
“Oh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, Messieurs	306.7873883709998
Porthos and Aramis!”	348.9347241420668
“Indeed! you know them likewise? I know them,” cried Milady, who began	269.231337888694
to feel a chill penetrate her heart.	166.840573322725
“Well, if you know them, you know that they are good and free	286.1945069228212
companions. Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of	285.8879824620613
help?”	182.75458836229592
“That is to say,” stammered Milady, “I am not really very intimate with	168.6872796331308
any of them. I know them from having heard one of their friends,	226.4481940905896
Monsieur d’Artagnan, say a great deal about them.”	306.0567863116871
“You know Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried the novice, in her turn seizing	182.64888465908555
the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes.	216.20477696187316
Then remarking the strange expression of Milady’s countenance, she	183.80761335874746
said, “Pardon me, madame; you know him by what title?”	327.7104943265532
“Why,” replied Milady, embarrassed, “why, by the title of friend.”	239.8149101596932
“You deceive me, madame,” said the novice; “you have been his	240.90089730112655
mistress!”	267.15842656017566
“It is you who have been his mistress, madame!” cried Milady, in her	360.5468591826385
turn.	283.01734730480905
“I?” said the novice.	300.0374369588835
“Yes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!”	262.7354484900957
The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror.	356.81386465473486
“Oh, do not deny it! Answer!” continued Milady.	335.78878202509713
“Well, yes, madame,” said the novice, “Are we rivals?”	334.805984287348
The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under	254.73340236185695
any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but	362.363048297407
she was absorbed by jealousy.	170.513481290478
“Speak, madame!” resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she	225.6996217938486
might not have been believed capable. “Have you been, or are you, his	285.76129643899435
mistress?”	317.21114905296326
“Oh, no!” cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her	185.92517770073343
truth. “Never, never!”	214.88691049009185
“I believe you,” said Mme. Bonacieux; “but why, then, did you cry out	260.48102901422
so?”	299.3626301472123
“Do you not understand?” said Milady, who had already overcome her	182.28134390280428
agitation and recovered all her presence of mind.	260.0376661610346
“How can I understand? I know nothing.”	235.72692425041717
“Can you not understand that Monsieur d’Artagnan, being my friend,	361.9656548776113
might take me into his confidence?”	184.12196091532834
“Truly?”	219.87820790156215
“Do you not perceive that I know all—your abduction from the little	353.0711115938691
house at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their	252.2888436992969
useless inquiries up to this moment? How could I help being astonished	353.70025496262997
when, without having the least expectation of such a thing, I meet you	169.21707206114303
face to face—you, of whom we have so often spoken together, you whom he	272.1976569099238
loves with all his soul, you whom he had taught me to love before I had	241.62000233657153
seen you! Ah, dear Constance, I have found you, then; I see you at	226.58776211242883
last!”	168.0958346226841
And Milady stretched out her arms to Mme. Bonacieux, who, convinced by	297.8270933079085
what she had just said, saw nothing in this woman whom an instant	271.7406650870007
before she had believed her rival but a sincere and devoted friend.	235.94213415632674
“Oh, pardon me, pardon me!” cried she, sinking upon the shoulders of	233.74765670877343
Milady. “Pardon me, I love him so much!”	280.48837005611495
These two women held each other for an instant in a close embrace.	265.1434435296998
Certainly, if Milady’s strength had been equal to her hatred, Mme.	255.34144800482247
Bonacieux would never have left that embrace alive. But not being able	358.3358306427899
to stifle her, she smiled upon her.	203.07322693896083
“Oh, you beautiful, good little creature!” said Milady. “How delighted	208.41049471994205
I am to have found you! Let me look at you!” and while saying these	269.3004709177001
words, she absolutely devoured her by her looks. “Oh, yes it is you	305.07925165846177
indeed! From what he has told me, I know you now. I recognize you	319.2620254586849
perfectly.”	318.1246746239751
The poor young woman could not possibly suspect what frightful cruelty	206.46942205749951
was behind the rampart of that pure brow, behind those brilliant eyes	171.66441443041197
in which she read nothing but interest and compassion.	351.6152222930652
“Then you know what I have suffered,” said Mme. Bonacieux, “since he	212.04979150623325
has told you what he has suffered; but to suffer for him is happiness.”	333.4032713935173
Milady replied mechanically, “Yes, that is happiness.” She was thinking	271.08367778814886
of something else.	277.6842142427173
“And then,” continued Mme. Bonacieux, “my punishment is drawing to a	226.96185889808868
close. Tomorrow, this evening, perhaps, I shall see him again; and then	343.17825821863573
the past will no longer exist.”	206.922840679493
“This evening?” asked Milady, roused from her reverie by these words.	300.1001312641501
“What do you mean? Do you expect news from him?”	276.964701158828
“I expect himself.”	324.68346972799833
“Himself? D’Artagnan here?”	169.7038319884615
“Himself!”	289.3865027752284
“But that’s impossible! He is at the siege of La Rochelle with the	222.57670648529916
cardinal. He will not return till after the taking of the city.”	287.7517576159646
“Ah, you fancy so! But is there anything impossible for my D’Artagnan,	240.3560182985881
the noble and loyal gentleman?”	238.3901515775444
“Oh, I cannot believe you!”	268.47125118479573
“Well, read, then!” said the unhappy young woman, in the excess of her	312.8684298840094
pride and joy, presenting a letter to Milady.	227.08664022408936
“The writing of Madame de Chevreuse!” said Milady to herself. “Ah, I	316.8460754281921
always thought there was some secret understanding in that quarter!”	191.9635284320275
And she greedily read the following few lines:	265.377738811919
MY DEAR CHILD, Hold yourself ready. _Our friend_ will see you soon, and	189.08017394490338
he will only see you to release you from that imprisonment in which	296.0464660682718
your safety required you should be concealed. Prepare, then, for your	171.7974731900721
departure, and never despair of us.	170.16616378069253
    Our charming Gascon has just proved himself as brave and faithful	253.86838724853277
    as ever. Tell him that certain parties are grateful for the warning	350.1303907925743
    he has given.	266.7874435351652
“Yes, yes,” said Milady; “the letter is precise. Do you know what that	179.1554968364452
warning was?”	316.52897728239503
“No, I only suspect he has warned the queen against some fresh	364.7765000092355
machinations of the cardinal.”	321.4018060491714
“Yes, that’s it, no doubt!” said Milady, returning the letter to Mme.	289.633075797026
Bonacieux, and letting her head sink pensively upon her bosom.	280.918221226939
At that moment they heard the gallop of a horse.	208.77392193364946
“Oh!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, darting to the window, “can it be he?”	200.59310757619372
Milady remained still in bed, petrified by surprise; so many unexpected	258.6104229167751
things happened to her all at once that for the first time she was at a	285.1117234462266
loss.	194.38321637954516
“He, he!” murmured she; “can it be he?” And she remained in bed with	178.9993360437788
her eyes fixed.	213.33720561995295
“Alas, no!” said Mme. Bonacieux; “it is a man I don’t know, although he	230.08264341387348
seems to be coming here. Yes, he checks his pace; he stops at the gate;	224.46510126184114
he rings.”	181.28284292701903
Milady sprang out of bed.	327.3573042226825
“You are sure it is not he?” said she.	217.38707667656212
“Yes, yes, very sure!”	211.18338465767187
“Perhaps you did not see well.”	173.48473346883742
“Oh, if I were to see the plume of his hat, the end of his cloak, I	312.1027103398328
should know _him!_”	172.6160381790669
Milady was dressing herself all the time.	356.96875938144365
“Yes, he has entered.”	285.41044141761176
“It is for you or me!”	360.76534088316396
“My God, how agitated you seem!”	350.7095823010261
“Yes, I admit it. I have not your confidence; I fear the cardinal.”	309.6251161494107
“Hush!” said Mme. Bonacieux; “somebody is coming.”	197.04029160048245
Immediately the door opened, and the superior entered.	333.92207561653197
“Did you come from Boulogne?” demanded she of Milady.	316.0756022456261
“Yes,” replied she, trying to recover her self-possession. “Who wants	362.07578507465075
me?”	222.22752824474105
“A man who will not tell his name, but who comes from the cardinal.”	345.27751939100006
“And who wishes to speak with me?”	207.4021368505974
“Who wishes to speak to a lady recently come from Boulogne.”	187.8912322247399
“Then let him come in, if you please.”	245.37137139979484
“Oh, my God, my God!” cried Mme. Bonacieux. “Can it be bad news?”	293.79093085540717
“I fear it.”	289.73636722744425
“I will leave you with this stranger; but as soon as he is gone, if you	258.56135342278174
will permit me, I will return.”	210.3264655298554
“_Permit_ you? I _beseech_ you.”	222.8914802173443
The superior and Mme. Bonacieux retired.	221.81380803808204
Milady remained alone, with her eyes fixed upon the door. An instant	250.22820278688832
later, the jingling of spurs was heard upon the stairs, steps drew	360.4281016253981
near, the door opened, and a man appeared.	336.8103210560173
Milady uttered a cry of joy; this man was the Comte de Rochefort—the	293.26565549172204
demoniacal tool of his Eminence.	247.16472017643576
Chapter LXII.	214.83245845212153
TWO VARIETIES OF DEMONS	331.24232935277405
Ah,” cried Milady and Rochefort together, “it is you!”	344.8899424903343
“Yes, it is I.”	299.57091463964525
“And you come?” asked Milady.	340.7156219835723
“From La Rochelle; and you?”	173.33048479669606
“From England.”	280.13229313336103
“Buckingham?”	306.7607083672715
“Dead or desperately wounded, as I left without having been able to	187.7026473368286
hear anything of him. A fanatic has just assassinated him.”	183.27080974109205
“Ah,” said Rochefort, with a smile; “this is a fortunate chance—one	207.74472746807396
that will delight his Eminence! Have you informed him of it?”	344.8329349857004
“I wrote to him from Boulogne. But what brings you here?”	345.7667226095572
“His Eminence was uneasy, and sent me to find you.”	277.16913673094535
“I only arrived yesterday.”	270.3809167653144
“And what have you been doing since yesterday?”	316.43433857226046
“I have not lost my time.”	254.0282639088748
“Oh, I don’t doubt that.”	207.93462889394817
“Do you know whom I have encountered here?”	178.44827633554397
“No.”	213.4730395135618
“Guess.”	193.86648559220532
“How can I?”	277.743247553504
“That young woman whom the queen took out of prison.”	219.17716569132506
“The mistress of that fellow D’Artagnan?”	333.1620602970725
“Yes; Madame Bonacieux, with whose retreat the cardinal was	195.48657659900212
unacquainted.”	228.42105731605537
“Well, well,” said Rochefort, “here is a chance which may pair off with	206.7567657087979
the other! Monsieur Cardinal is indeed a privileged man!”	267.88600084308155
“Imagine my astonishment,” continued Milady, “when I found myself face	365.2312199669788
to face with this woman!”	209.41161784855558
“Does she know you?”	258.75483806463586
“No.”	302.3203612666864
“Then she looks upon you as a stranger?”	240.85126067642784
Milady smiled. “I am her best friend.”	250.9750864287796
“Upon my honor,” said Rochefort, “it takes you, my dear countess, to	268.8032949512443
perform such miracles!”	209.1665910584219
“And it is well I can, Chevalier,” said Milady, “for do you know what	175.76970195923744
is going on here?”	255.42503216000352
“No.”	315.28523707065233
“They will come for her tomorrow or the day after, with an order from	206.2093983254418
the queen.”	316.89307487900675
“Indeed! And who?”	243.59964196529495
“D’Artagnan and his friends.”	190.48816294780784
“Indeed, they will go so far that we shall be obliged to send them to	217.80223240957466
the Bastille.”	176.00769414718724
“Why is it not done already?”	189.6134068044202
“What would you? The cardinal has a weakness for these men which I	360.5490829679312
cannot comprehend.”	222.35068533609098
“Indeed!”	290.6624502279193
“Yes.”	310.38234596942175
“Well, then, tell him this, Rochefort. Tell him that our conversation	301.91381518178315
at the inn of the Red Dovecot was overheard by these four men; tell him	274.5223439602892
that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by	272.03878293106675
violence the safe-conduct which he had given me; tell him they warned	349.1697263871928
Lord de Winter of my journey to England; that this time they nearly	330.73869784494855
foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs; tell him that	329.3768153392549
among these four men two only are to be feared—D’Artagnan and Athos;	311.9193182093853
tell him that the third, Aramis, is the lover of Madame de Chevreuse—he	300.2199982012793
may be left alone, we know his secret, and it may be useful; as to the	347.1427556149847
fourth, Porthos, he is a fool, a simpleton, a blustering booby, not	331.4752111194582
worth troubling himself about.”	166.2406169870558
“But these four men must be now at the siege of La Rochelle?”	330.30256436881587
“I thought so, too; but a letter which Madame Bonacieux has received	251.2801497363327
from Madame the Constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show	224.94621633353592
me, leads me to believe that these four men, on the contrary, are on	335.02675377240246
the road hither to take her away.”	363.68333818457745
“The devil! What’s to be done?”	242.46416317755575
“What did the cardinal say about me?”	243.0738635428632
“I was to take your dispatches, written or verbal, and return by post;	237.44926340053064
and when he shall know what you have done, he will advise what you have	275.7548381708557
to do.”	291.8908869424501
“I must, then, remain here?”	269.0740361532461
“Here, or in the neighborhood.”	214.8039527779681
“You cannot take me with you?”	310.3799358883655
“No, the order is imperative. Near the camp you might be recognized;	286.7230573792815
and your presence, you must be aware, would compromise the cardinal.”	283.48730530919573
“Then I must wait here, or in the neighborhood?”	188.88074291822068
“Only tell me beforehand where you will wait for intelligence from the	315.3029283067618
cardinal; let me know always where to find you.”	307.51063163369423
“Observe, it is probable that I may not be able to remain here.”	192.11167931512566
“Why?”	284.0294971713374
“You forget that my enemies may arrive at any minute.”	356.68435636683375
“That’s true; but is this little woman, then, to escape his Eminence?”	208.90875971621963
“Bah!” said Milady, with a smile that belonged only to herself; “you	175.95242211875816
forget that I am her best friend.”	357.5725470766406
“Ah, that’s true! I may then tell the cardinal, with respect to this	321.1969920342279
little woman—”	247.81001480796766
“That he may be at ease.”	291.7501256283049
“Is that all?”	230.19993731263526
“He will know what that means.”	297.9234860836907
“He will guess, at least. Now, then, what had I better do?”	185.2131698144995
“Return instantly. It appears to me that the news you bear is worth the	268.52767115223094
trouble of a little diligence.”	202.95754528847013
“My chaise broke down coming into Lilliers.”	222.75317639081152
“Capital!”	337.9432264279077
“What, _capital?_”	329.4122513312915
“Yes, I want your chaise.”	289.25603459988486
“And how shall I travel, then?”	301.2524552282265
“On horseback.”	309.6390310682062
“You talk very comfortably,—a hundred and eighty leagues!”	329.28692359137256
“What’s that?”	275.3683464094278
“One can do it! Afterward?”	234.90639551842025
“Afterward? Why, in passing through Lilliers you will send me your	216.1595766336125
chaise, with an order to your servant to place himself at my disposal.”	281.382691428658
“Well.”	259.6934980867063
“You have, no doubt, some order from the cardinal about you?”	198.80596248711004
“I have my _full power_.”	328.15416032756605
“Show it to the abbess, and tell her that someone will come and fetch	318.59506641941636
me, either today or tomorrow, and that I am to follow the person who	353.3068579545343
presents himself in your name.”	177.40653453636168
“Very well.”	188.73974935943704
“Don’t forget to treat me harshly in speaking of me to the abbess.”	197.0882910715135
“To what purpose?”	283.3977646130194
“I am a victim of the cardinal. It is necessary to inspire confidence	280.0168114501065
in that poor little Madame Bonacieux.”	312.5780696016534
“That’s true. Now, will you make me a report of all that has happened?”	345.39056923745335
“Why, I have related the events to you. You have a good memory; repeat	240.4626638935094
what I have told you. A paper may be lost.”	306.87707236346944
“You are right; only let me know where to find you that I may not run	232.12172229605596
needlessly about the neighborhood.”	302.21732831128077
“That’s correct; wait!”	203.99789795618386
“Do you want a map?”	321.37230822154083
“Oh, I know this country marvelously!”	264.3568481717386
“You? When were you here?”	327.4864640092682
“I was brought up here.”	224.75833684263364
“Truly?”	206.67480436093456
“It is worth something, you see, to have been brought up somewhere.”	304.9059003262661
“You will wait for me, then?”	330.7217405822106
“Let me reflect a little! Ay, that will do—at Armentières.”	301.2352407366502
“Where is that Armentières?”	304.5602541728516
“A little town on the Lys; I shall only have to cross the river, and I	321.78627878696864
shall be in a foreign country.”	277.069484737193
“Capital! but it is understood you will only cross the river in case of	246.90133795695806
danger.”	189.18431586241744
“That is well understood.”	292.81291598724204
“And in that case, how shall I know where you are?”	334.4246568427027
“You do not want your lackey?”	236.5728581333441
“Is he a sure man?”	318.0527417420292
“To the proof.”	257.2640680997183
“Give him to me. Nobody knows him. I will leave him at the place I	225.85203330008864
quit, and he will conduct you to me.”	319.4713805212943
“And you say you will wait for me at Armentières?”	288.0880638357354
“At Armentières.”	222.24909895612743
“Write that name on a bit of paper, lest I should forget it. There is	341.7369378706744
nothing compromising in the name of a town. Is it not so?”	190.55067897200394
“Eh, who knows? Never mind,” said Milady, writing the name on half a	353.40333673439716
sheet of paper; “I will compromise myself.”	299.31203853286286
“Well,” said Rochefort, taking the paper from Milady, folding it, and	216.37476085361703
placing it in the lining of his hat, “you may be easy. I will do as	203.00893392219155
children do, for fear of losing the paper—repeat the name along the	356.4354650705233
route. Now, is that all?”	320.8129691315938
“I believe so.”	227.26064905847977
“Let us see: Buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation	273.1439178413236
with the cardinal overheard by the four Musketeers; Lord de Winter	316.4371778455085
warned of your arrival at Portsmouth; D’Artagnan and Athos to the	270.37205372505065
Bastille; Aramis the lover of Madame de Chevreuse; Porthos an ass;	242.14845340929412
Madame Bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as	198.12532326879617
possible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim	199.21732401825406
of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;	251.9664165579267
Armentières, on the banks of the Lys. Is that all, then?”	354.09000191528287
“In truth, my dear Chevalier, you are a miracle of memory. _A propos_,	211.1965355768433
add one thing—”	231.1067591882602
“What?”	280.2402637956785
“I saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent garden.	291.50324643064874
Say that I am permitted to walk in those woods. Who knows? Perhaps I	320.2754598451052
shall stand in need of a back door for retreat.”	287.04497569702505
“You think of everything.”	195.30518751742585
“And you forget one thing.”	200.60648863701556
“What?”	296.7095181095075
“To ask me if I want money.”	252.1073909897865
“That’s true. How much do you want?”	221.4357903736226
“All you have in gold.”	249.545561770985
“I have five hundred pistoles, or thereabouts.”	174.10619649832444
“I have as much. With a thousand pistoles one may face everything.	178.3378773925309
Empty your pockets.”	298.36284312520104
“There.”	186.7093364609779
“Right. And you go—”	169.78639752593483
“In an hour—time to eat a morsel, during which I shall send for a post	281.4072512143175
horse.”	206.6358966068758
“Capital! Adieu, Chevalier.”	299.22850511083124
“Adieu, Countess.”	191.0849204289919
“Commend me to the cardinal.”	360.5990943697227
“Commend me to Satan.”	248.43166089827614
Milady and Rochefort exchanged a smile and separated. An hour afterward	296.3098263956051
Rochefort set out at a grand gallop; five hours after that he passed	299.77599743581936
through Arras.	229.92632338938074
Our readers already know how he was recognized by D’Artagnan, and how	349.70215196589317
that recognition by inspiring fear in the four Musketeers had given	351.037623789808
fresh activity to their journey.	278.0634631146402
Chapter LXIII.	336.5167742106979
THE DROP OF WATER	304.8537952133015
Rochefort had scarcely departed when Mme. Bonacieux re-entered. She	222.81468643354165
found Milady with a smiling countenance.	252.79614726431976
“Well,” said the young woman, “what you dreaded has happened. This	234.0909195105885
evening, or tomorrow, the cardinal will send someone to take you away.”	338.4125115409181
“Who told you that, my dear?” asked Milady.	190.01840157516796
“I heard it from the mouth of the messenger himself.”	221.58676623877304
“Come and sit down close to me,” said Milady.	274.2613340176637
“Here I am.”	335.8527953685243
“Wait till I assure myself that nobody hears us.”	356.0324039946091
“Why all these precautions?”	201.7360623803533
“You shall know.”	316.2608474125815
Milady arose, went to the door, opened it, looked in the corridor, and	257.2668084598598
then returned and seated herself close to Mme. Bonacieux.	227.23287497255166
“Then,” said she, “he has well played his part.”	348.13621969807093
“Who has?”	238.39174316471906
“He who just now presented himself to the abbess as a messenger from	224.98721599826624
the cardinal.”	260.80399410673283
“It was, then, a part he was playing?”	325.1915843883106
“Yes, my child.”	232.7891024343134
“That man, then, was not—”	278.9743253439008
“That man,” said Milady, lowering her voice, “is my brother.”	357.2771427009503
“Your brother!” cried Mme. Bonacieux.	350.96163099298485
“No one must know this secret, my dear, but yourself. If you reveal it	226.48108610580016
to anyone in the world, I shall be lost, and perhaps yourself	332.159162740664
likewise.”	251.54416055368893
“Oh, my God!”	309.3526098279619
“Listen. This is what has happened: My brother, who was coming to my	267.0138874548444
assistance to take me away by force if it were necessary, met with the	192.97084351053508
emissary of the cardinal, who was coming in search of me. He followed	189.4520812587131
him. At a solitary and retired part of the road he drew his sword, and	277.10493131674014
required the messenger to deliver up to him the papers of which he was	254.03596964440928
the bearer. The messenger resisted; my brother killed him.”	261.16310439463183
“Oh!” said Mme. Bonacieux, shuddering.	206.92875151676128
“Remember, that was the only means. Then my brother determined to	349.1010151610124
substitute cunning for force. He took the papers, and presented himself	299.7116896275348
here as the emissary of the cardinal, and in an hour or two a carriage	343.56893696375244
will come to take me away by the orders of his Eminence.”	359.71265438295313
“I understand. It is your brother who sends this carriage.”	231.69950931668444
“Exactly; but that is not all. That letter you have received, and which	196.90225740709573
you believe to be from Madame de Chevreuse—”	303.7486019749458
“Well?”	348.4176947993691
“It is a forgery.”	267.7470823954159
“How can that be?”	345.4195712648559
“Yes, a forgery; it is a snare to prevent your making any resistance	325.87319736831375
when they come to fetch you.”	290.50476968812507
“But it is D’Artagnan that will come.”	347.14634078545095
“Do not deceive yourself. D’Artagnan and his friends are detained at	362.08579630175973
the siege of La Rochelle.”	206.1857014209688
“How do you know that?”	248.92636023853308
“My brother met some emissaries of the cardinal in the uniform of	168.40852082079766
Musketeers. You would have been summoned to the gate; you would have	323.3795621601102
believed yourself about to meet friends; you would have been abducted,	182.41588382091524
and conducted back to Paris.”	300.8472787286853
“Oh, my God! My senses fail me amid such a chaos of iniquities. I feel,	212.26924932862238
if this continues,” said Mme. Bonacieux, raising her hands to her	280.26384901314555
forehead, “I shall go mad!”	186.716040645566
“Stop—”	212.52499434383503
“What?”	212.0991802266526
“I hear a horse’s steps; it is my brother setting off again. I should	361.18518864452824
like to offer him a last salute. Come!”	357.95166215113994
Milady opened the window, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to join	296.45822714191576
her. The young woman complied.	218.20876276306853
Rochefort passed at a gallop.	182.31367560045632
“Adieu, brother!” cried Milady.	279.1900525795562
The chevalier raised his head, saw the two young women, and without	259.7379460514579
stopping, waved his hand in a friendly way to Milady.	299.5032194469753
“The good George!” said she, closing the window with an expression of	302.46994725139757
countenance full of affection and melancholy. And she resumed her seat,	174.9900669982349
as if plunged in reflections entirely personal.	263.2548371139171
“Dear lady,” said Mme. Bonacieux, “pardon me for interrupting you; but	183.63519444706486
what do you advise me to do? Good heaven! You have more experience than	280.64287692454883
I have. Speak; I will listen.”	321.1653058729067
“In the first place,” said Milady, “it is possible I may be deceived,	272.5920043169487
and that D’Artagnan and his friends may really come to your	279.92125991225794
assistance.”	338.97939554141954
“Oh, that would be too much!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “so much happiness	312.22032273228257
is not in store for me!”	233.3301797160818
“Then you comprehend it would be only a question of time, a sort of	176.74139136405685
race, which should arrive first. If your friends are the more speedy,	230.2387408203224
you are to be saved; if the satellites of the cardinal, you are lost.”	355.77417899420766
“Oh, yes, yes; lost beyond redemption! What, then, to do? What to do?”	166.0747184221023
“There would be a very simple means, very natural—”	293.4060378481592
“Tell me what!”	207.49411374365073
“To wait, concealed in the neighborhood, and assure yourself who are	258.45444434136243
the men who come to ask for you.”	327.2154624574418
“But where can I wait?”	168.4775908446172
“Oh, there is no difficulty in that. I shall stop and conceal myself a	323.3606110877125
few leagues hence until my brother can rejoin me. Well, I take you with	190.37524114240762
me; we conceal ourselves, and wait together.”	194.18274474669195
“But I shall not be allowed to go; I am almost a prisoner.”	263.4622182428849
“As they believe that I go in consequence of an order from the	351.4068050662928
cardinal, no one will believe you anxious to follow me.”	313.3741494219911
“Well?”	351.76799940868324
“Well! The carriage is at the door; you bid me adieu; you mount the	291.84015460615615
step to embrace me a last time; my brother’s servant, who comes to	174.88019607854278
fetch me, is told how to proceed; he makes a sign to the postillion,	166.83891464002784
and we set off at a gallop.”	296.20095320816506
“But D’Artagnan! D’Artagnan! if he comes?”	317.40992643213315
“Shall we not know it?”	210.737725164461
“How?”	308.71215210240183
“Nothing easier. We will send my brother’s servant back to Béthune,	293.6869706818472
whom, as I told you, we can trust. He shall assume a disguise, and	307.6553288030947
place himself in front of the convent. If the emissaries of the	334.6207084278923
cardinal arrive, he will take no notice; if it is Monsieur d’Artagnan	177.49269702256808
and his friends, he will bring them to us.”	317.8794222852914
“He knows them, then?”	229.97239960650157
“Doubtless. Has he not seen Monsieur d’Artagnan at my house?”	355.84021904335555
“Oh, yes, yes; you are right. Thus all may go well—all may be for the	229.54970694015373
best; but we do not go far from this place?”	219.7563755190912
“Seven or eight leagues at the most. We will keep on the frontiers, for	279.6666004625054
instance; and at the first alarm we can leave France.”	260.45062103172063
“And what can we do there?”	284.71917081145244
“Wait.”	240.44555891009912
“But if they come?”	169.28983084776704
“My brother’s carriage will be here first.”	219.79008677105168
“If I should happen to be any distance from you when the carriage comes	354.10443647494736
for you—at dinner or supper, for instance?”	192.4048287242402
“Do one thing.”	247.5006008910773
“What is that?”	258.8202847023037
“Tell your good superior that in order that we may be as much together	309.3472943804527
as possible, you ask her permission to share my repast.”	342.18011625731833
“Will she permit it?”	214.77105452551388
“What inconvenience can it be?”	199.31427860814372
“Oh, delightful! In this way we shall not be separated for an instant.”	355.2761054078833
“Well, go down to her, then, to make your request. I feel my head a	249.0474107292341
little confused; I will take a turn in the garden.”	237.48389832412857
“Go; and where shall I find you?”	278.6416105849994
“Here, in an hour.”	358.3890314526533
“Here, in an hour. Oh, you are so kind, and I am so grateful!”	214.28711756115416
“How can I avoid interesting myself for one who is so beautiful and so	283.3790212755126
amiable? Are you not the beloved of one of my best friends?”	279.2883440321691
“Dear D’Artagnan! Oh, how he will thank you!”	260.0049908692271
“I hope so. Now, then, all is agreed; let us go down.”	191.57478592048892
“You are going into the garden?”	286.5784411677705
“Yes.”	356.2782109293229
“Go along this corridor, down a little staircase, and you are in it.”	229.20212805204164
“Excellent; thank you!”	227.94055964192893
And the two women parted, exchanging charming smiles.	211.4178603632194
Milady had told the truth—her head was confused, for her ill-arranged	211.06911710295003
plans clashed one another like chaos. She required to be alone that she	208.78727968103217
might put her thoughts a little into order. She saw vaguely the future;	236.01727258703954
but she stood in need of a little silence and quiet to give all her	266.57756349499033
ideas, as yet confused, a distinct form and a regular plan.	238.7207339389335
What was most pressing was to get Mme. Bonacieux away, and convey her	365.0640720532751
to a place of safety, and there, if matters required, make her a	200.45527756175431
hostage. Milady began to have doubts of the issue of this terrible	236.45368547413705
duel, in which her enemies showed as much perseverance as she did	222.49811582866528
animosity.	196.8484811125721
Besides, she felt as we feel when a storm is coming on—that this issue	304.5006679802399
was near, and could not fail to be terrible.	220.93212843646558
The principal thing for her, then, was, as we have said, to keep Mme.	256.88970834055755
Bonacieux in her power. Mme. Bonacieux was the very life of D’Artagnan.	277.2232093797263
This was more than his life, the life of the woman he loved; this was,	193.166827763597
in case of ill fortune, a means of temporizing and obtaining good	235.43097191897945
conditions.	184.4520270412216
Now, this point was settled; Mme. Bonacieux, without any suspicion,	297.8600896315004
accompanied her. Once concealed with her at Armentières, it would be	167.78732611941635
easy to make her believe that D’Artagnan had not come to Béthune. In	310.6824574766576
fifteen days at most, Rochefort would be back; besides, during that	181.012656101339
fifteen days she would have time to think how she could best avenge	250.74427259028744
herself on the four friends. She would not be weary, thank God! for she	243.23719357258358
should enjoy the sweetest pastime such events could accord a woman of	286.1107449445956
her character—perfecting a beautiful vengeance.	168.5366361279322
Revolving all this in her mind, she cast her eyes around her, and	320.5752034936785
arranged the topography of the garden in her head. Milady was like a	208.25803955448615
good general who contemplates at the same time victory and defeat, and	280.8944827146929
who is quite prepared, according to the chances of the battle, to march	339.2058991809015
forward or to beat a retreat.	278.6465352965062
At the end of an hour she heard a soft voice calling her; it was Mme.	272.95658446043296
Bonacieux’s. The good abbess had naturally consented to her request;	254.84031275452725
and as a commencement, they were to sup together.	251.73756373612065
On reaching the courtyard, they heard the noise of a carriage which	303.60767736918797
stopped at the gate.	239.28869242069007
Milady listened.	306.3479193741786
“Do you hear anything?” said she.	311.82478492239477
“Yes, the rolling of a carriage.”	352.9388278987981
“It is the one my brother sends for us.”	302.6129437446459
“Oh, my God!”	245.13054654113552
“Come, come! courage!”	334.41382324567155
The bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken.	212.42195217734348
“Go to your chamber,” said she to Mme. Bonacieux; “you have perhaps	338.18139056684123
some jewels you would like to take.”	302.16632345258665
“I have his letters,” said she.	285.3535750711842
“Well, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some	246.5315059143339
supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our	269.1695701164
strength up.”	169.25896440985946
“Great God!” said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, “my	327.1463952091403
heart beats so I cannot walk.”	345.9656505909301
“Courage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be	301.94324612648745
safe; and think that what you are about to do is for _his_ sake.”	213.73330231314756
“Yes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single	182.75243659308748
word; go, I will rejoin you.”	275.6412273582148
Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort’s	327.8588567242873
lackey, and gave him his instructions.	243.839473980219
He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear,	304.05238947997736
the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the	363.218220368204
convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was	212.98210022026035
situated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross	195.4058050291378
the garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said,	187.26481169049092
Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France.	359.868313939425
If the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been	246.7364966970355
agreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her	206.55483235046037
adieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux.	345.5572365030342
Mme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any,	167.45140616879632
Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her	167.98459623311277
instructions.	200.08149072961655
Milady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn	274.7964579403865
by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort’s lackey would	321.50884351552327
precede it, as courier.	211.68351005431896
Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any	272.22656889537427
suspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female	196.17794440431086
could be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de	359.92184199472393
Winter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown to	216.55549995080926
her, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so	220.75855437600114
fatal a share in the misfortune of her life.	328.70405280848877
“You see,” said she, when the lackey had gone out, “everything is	340.3542686259054
ready. The abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by	275.3648072760871
order of the cardinal. This man goes to give his last orders; take the	341.5170855719763
least thing, drink a finger of wine, and let us be gone.”	347.259934895533
“Yes,” said Mme. Bonacieux, mechanically, “yes, let us be gone.”	220.29790085464464
Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite, poured her a small glass	278.688937796577
of Spanish wine, and helped her to the wing of a chicken.	201.52110895288388
“See,” said she, “if everything does not second us! Here is night	249.537708858316
coming on; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody	324.84880972163256
can guess where we are. Come, courage! take something.”	264.3608769872694
Mme. Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically, and just touched the	345.20678886405
glass with her lips.	308.78813453452415
“Come, come!” said Milady, lifting hers to her mouth, “do as I do.”	266.6249706269354
But at the moment the glass touched her lips, her hand remained	282.26784033075916
suspended; she heard something on the road which sounded like the	303.5245253600209
rattling of a distant gallop. Then it grew nearer, and it seemed to	325.00554012548804
her, almost at the same time, that she heard the neighing of horses.	200.41768835271742
This noise acted upon her joy like the storm which awakens the sleeper	178.1310416628637
in the midst of a happy dream; she grew pale and ran to the window,	336.0293208174266
while Mme. Bonacieux, rising all in a tremble, supported herself upon	225.29161227467324
her chair to avoid falling. Nothing was yet to be seen, only they heard	355.47336300177517
the galloping draw nearer.	195.4411561473096
“Oh, my God!” said Mme. Bonacieux, “what is that noise?”	303.19597998493487
“That of either our friends or our enemies,” said Milady, with her	319.8803022025651
terrible coolness. “Stay where you are, I will tell you.”	231.7914937524882
Mme. Bonacieux remained standing, mute, motionless, and pale as a	188.0244579566119
statue.	245.15637371589418
The noise became louder; the horses could not be more than a hundred	309.4828793262216
and fifty paces distant. If they were not yet to be seen, it was	296.0055773624717
because the road made an elbow. The noise became so distinct that the	217.54389956973552
horses might be counted by the rattle of their hoofs.	269.2489650493645
Milady gazed with all the power of her attention; it was just light	342.821009004385
enough for her to see who was coming.	286.9744901009091
All at once, at the turning of the road she saw the glitter of laced	216.8247331003626
hats and the waving of feathers; she counted two, then five, then eight	259.25457281535705
horsemen. One of them preceded the rest by double the length of his	228.7535913398372
horse.	297.8006362881838
Milady uttered a stifled groan. In the first horseman she recognized	200.02268636591452
D’Artagnan.	342.80026876981265
“Oh, my God, my God,” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “what is it?”	170.82834638629905
“It is the uniform of the cardinal’s Guards. Not an instant to be lost!	195.10580465504546
Fly, fly!”	350.91711810072275
“Yes, yes, let us fly!” repeated Mme. Bonacieux, but without being able	327.4938014596926
to make a step, glued as she was to the spot by terror.	172.37654391278818
They heard the horsemen pass under the windows.	314.79200582104437
“Come, then, come, then!” cried Milady, trying to drag the young woman	186.10887664132366
along by the arm. “Thanks to the garden, we yet can flee; I have the	261.3227446155302
key, but make haste! in five minutes it will be too late!”	227.2907049083273
Mme. Bonacieux tried to walk, made two steps, and sank upon her knees.	277.50633116196263
Milady tried to raise and carry her, but could not do it.	259.067070427845
At this moment they heard the rolling of the carriage, which at the	192.9094283971508
approach of the Musketeers set off at a gallop. Then three or four	221.4819253468386
shots were fired.	194.92017114839825
“For the last time, will you come?” cried Milady.	363.02517186537665
“Oh, my God, my God! you see my strength fails me; you see plainly I	228.62184833359797
cannot walk. Flee alone!”	278.7291549307761
“Flee alone, and leave you here? No, no, never!” cried Milady.	359.6639439033487
All at once she paused, a livid flash darted from her eyes; she ran to	305.8338665823993
the table, emptied into Mme. Bonacieux’s glass the contents of a ring	331.23841176242564
which she opened with singular quickness. It was a grain of a reddish	245.73001523707507
color, which dissolved immediately.	291.38602301562014
Then, taking the glass with a firm hand, she said, “Drink. This wine	316.2691610003068
will give you strength, drink!” And she put the glass to the lips of	180.5970170926198
the young woman, who drank mechanically.	178.66640091643646
“This is not the way that I wished to avenge myself,” said Milady,	260.30299891058485
replacing the glass upon the table, with an infernal smile, “but, my	214.20069993504143
faith! we do what we can!” And she rushed out of the room.	364.5887494361228
Mme. Bonacieux saw her go without being able to follow her; she was	229.07790404665468
like people who dream they are pursued, and who in vain try to walk.	305.55500017335504
A few moments passed; a great noise was heard at the gate. Every	294.2304253985135
instant Mme. Bonacieux expected to see Milady, but she did not return.	225.68554310051948
Several times, with terror, no doubt, the cold sweat burst from her	244.82698538888548
burning brow.	253.14114709022684
At length she heard the grating of the hinges of the opening gates; the	273.20022078715596
noise of boots and spurs resounded on the stairs. There was a great	172.5698760651971
murmur of voices which continued to draw near, amid which she seemed to	292.15513049979927
hear her own name pronounced.	333.57945886002517
All at once she uttered a loud cry of joy, and darted toward the door;	327.38703402673696
she had recognized the voice of D’Artagnan.	229.56864174919568
“D’Artagnan! D’Artagnan!” cried she, “is it you? This way! this way!”	356.19215167212997
“Constance? Constance?” replied the young man, “where are you? where	269.3647170056703
are you? My God!”	247.12752083169943
At the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than	191.3633922663228
opened; several men rushed into the chamber. Mme. Bonacieux had sunk	264.6574954909959
into an armchair, without the power of moving.	329.3070073522969
D’Artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,	262.3713697002834
and fell on his knees before his mistress. Athos replaced his in his	334.2520691207082
belt; Porthos and Aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,	290.9258500883961
returned them to their scabbards.	316.63093694894087
“Oh, D’Artagnan, my beloved D’Artagnan! You have come, then, at last!	273.47252590981225
You have not deceived me! It is indeed thee!”	298.26858047816154
“Yes, yes, Constance. Reunited!”	337.3405369354832
“Oh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! I hoped in silence.	297.11339646101874
I was not willing to fly. Oh, I have done well! How happy I am!”	355.8845861283581
At this word _she_, Athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.	277.46524216292016
“_She!_ What she?” asked D’Artagnan.	348.2853541815539
“Why, my companion. She who out of friendship for me wished to take me	312.04042853725036
from my persecutors. She who, mistaking you for the cardinal’s Guards,	225.67835033066433
has just fled away.”	316.26314223191673
“Your companion!” cried D’Artagnan, becoming more pale than the white	232.62602171754915
veil of his mistress. “Of what companion are you speaking, dear	245.33008221019315
Constance?”	340.1914669864801
“Of her whose carriage was at the gate; of a woman who calls herself	202.47948132727112
your friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything.”	218.01636495164402
“Her name, her name!” cried D’Artagnan. “My God, can you not remember	261.3460967041737
her name?”	314.3465286083558
“Yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. Stop—but—it is very	284.4758483434135
strange—oh, my God, my head swims! I cannot see!”	228.4928742672895
“Help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold,” cried D’Artagnan.	239.9369559415814
“She is ill! Great God, she is losing her senses!”	353.67877813177245
While Porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong	258.35303746603137
voice, Aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped	284.6140785492199
at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the	263.48182624684534
countenance of Athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising	282.7018076851315
from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the	322.4680137141698
glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.	192.79069910181278
“Oh!” said Athos, “oh, no, it is impossible! God would not permit such	333.07308789563416
a crime!”	277.34734486820116
“Water, water!” cried D’Artagnan. “Water!”	364.8959838549398
“Oh, poor woman, poor woman!” murmured Athos, in a broken voice.	319.40285755429625
Mme. Bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of D’Artagnan.	261.4903179156996
“She revives!” cried the young man. “Oh, my God, my God, I thank thee!”	183.3850829359496
“Madame!” said Athos, “madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass	200.70320369978185
is this?”	353.23461706946205
“Mine, monsieur,” said the young woman, in a dying voice.	245.73578383607057
“But who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?”	227.55812335258975
“She.”	238.2787928926137
“But who is _she?_”	179.2312708874699
“Oh, I remember!” said Mme. Bonacieux, “the Comtesse de Winter.”	169.91147835415103
The four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of Athos	245.1610890705599
dominated all the rest.	349.2312266255508
At that moment the countenance of Mme. Bonacieux became livid; a	248.41288806345796
fearful agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of	194.29610011560123
Porthos and Aramis.	247.15955842399637
D’Artagnan seized the hands of Athos with an anguish difficult to be	267.3459266572607
described.	338.88043842056675
“And what do you believe?” His voice was stifled by sobs.	198.16410836415918
“I believe everything,” said Athos, biting his lips till the blood	321.88277443260324
sprang to avoid sighing.	196.82740541191566
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan!” cried Mme. Bonacieux, “where art thou? Do not	220.03650983629635
leave me! You see I am dying!”	275.25536930593614
D’Artagnan released the hands of Athos which he still held clasped in	315.5100602303712
both his own, and hastened to her. Her beautiful face was distorted	236.77498576148804
with agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive	235.61130379955688
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.	344.02438253967694
“In the name of heaven, run, call! Aramis! Porthos! Call for help!”	202.31254080646357
“Useless!” said Athos, “useless! For the poison which _she_ pours there	358.6589240524878
is no antidote.”	363.59634302486904
“Yes, yes! Help, help!” murmured Mme. Bonacieux; “help!”	283.42857354162305
Then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man	184.61479384161166
between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul	287.090088414933
passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.	321.40180338838246
“Constance, Constance!” cried D’Artagnan.	222.91471213999716
A sigh escaped from the mouth of Mme. Bonacieux, and dwelt for an	265.73185728395197
instant on the lips of D’Artagnan. That sigh was the soul, so chaste	240.98049009499385
and so loving, which reascended to heaven.	255.79606043291082
D’Artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. The young man	199.75587856018623
uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy	191.26827710894398
as herself.	234.64740237879113
Porthos wept; Aramis pointed toward heaven; Athos made the sign of the	350.8006711624522
cross.	291.92521902604415
At that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those	332.2169459514463
in the chamber. He looked around him and saw Mme. Bonacieux dead, and	235.71729789758095
D’Artagnan in a swoon. He appeared just at that moment of stupor which	259.26952393859983
follows great catastrophes.	209.05560395226507
“I was not deceived,” said he; “here is Monsieur d’Artagnan; and you	355.2797056833417
are his friends, Messieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.”	212.88039472642825
The persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger	246.28777890509303
with astonishment. It seemed to all three that they knew him.	260.9609720885182
“Gentlemen,” resumed the newcomer, “you are, as I am, in search of a	317.0180947958229
woman who,” added he, with a terrible smile, “must have passed this	234.34543140369203
way, for I see a corpse.”	302.20220751210127
The three friends remained mute—for although the voice as well as the	220.69085418096614
countenance reminded them of someone they had seen, they could not	206.04457944875742
remember under what circumstances.	174.3243361346372
“Gentlemen,” continued the stranger, “since you do not recognize a man	245.18403794505767
who probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself. I am Lord	334.67587036287716
de Winter, brother-in-law of that _woman_.”	220.60944475076695
The three friends uttered a cry of surprise.	351.0858372308818
Athos rose, and offering him his hand, “Be welcome, my Lord,” said he,	231.67799061654995
“you are one of us.”	342.68206173507633
“I set out five hours after her from Portsmouth,” said Lord de Winter.	190.80574422636894
“I arrived three hours after her at Boulogne. I missed her by twenty	355.34650880574475
minutes at St. Omer. Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her. I	240.19850749162322
was going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you	258.84308062195475
gallop past. I recognized Monsieur d’Artagnan. I called to you, but you	360.22922233590344
did not answer me; I wished to follow you, but my horse was too much	175.37734575001957
fatigued to go at the same pace with yours. And yet it appears, in	323.26695404701024
spite of all your diligence, you have arrived too late.”	217.34761396499061
“You see!” said Athos, pointing to Mme. Bonacieux dead, and to	251.33663674935977
D’Artagnan, whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life.	267.9866577510694
“Are they both dead?” asked Lord de Winter, sternly.	292.34206475593294
“No,” replied Athos, “fortunately Monsieur d’Artagnan has only	272.05569206616366
fainted.”	249.24690970455703
“Ah, indeed, so much the better!” said Lord de Winter.	334.2683484952171
At that moment D’Artagnan opened his eyes. He tore himself from the	209.8986789128391
arms of Porthos and Aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the	205.52096572767405
corpse of his mistress.	236.13920320237042
Athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,	212.49193551239514
embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to	196.84106008912295
him with his noble and persuasive voice, “Friend, be a man! Women weep	182.0317606514096
for the dead; men avenge them!”	333.80216161892224
“Oh, yes!” cried D’Artagnan, “yes! If it be to avenge her, I am ready	271.6127882380335
to follow you.”	351.6636401477255
Athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance	266.3676237579319
restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to Porthos and Aramis	297.9764049304542
to go and fetch the superior.	300.75307736585853
The two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much	326.23643016791976
upset by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against	234.08897181804667
all monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.	214.07611223055594
“Madame,” said Athos, passing his arm under that of D’Artagnan, “we	317.6615107022005
abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. She was	285.63443775347434
an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. Treat her as one of	194.56303303752546
your sisters. We will return someday to pray over her grave.”	221.65374603080863
D’Artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of Athos, and sobbed aloud.	254.13752149646325
“Weep,” said Athos, “weep, heart full of love, youth, and life! Alas,	252.59474442874617
would I could weep like you!”	344.37493318326244
And he drew away his friend, as affectionate as a father, as consoling	332.0666153036086
as a priest, noble as a man who has suffered much.	246.1620344152072
All five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their	241.66737918785074
way to the town of Béthune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped	281.40613945390686
before the first inn they came to.	340.15591057813947
“But,” said D’Artagnan, “shall we not pursue that woman?”	257.5412013110163
“Later,” said Athos. “I have measures to take.”	202.38951768102444
“She will escape us,” replied the young man; “she will escape us, and	271.6647216596765
it will be your fault, Athos.”	286.3469528082129
“I will be accountable for her,” said Athos.	193.57857467041984
D’Artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he	289.1271645379532
lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.	206.19381994225654
Porthos and Aramis regarded each other, not understanding this	199.1502202905561
assurance of Athos.	287.6978724083632
Lord de Winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of	183.11396738583625
D’Artagnan.	360.54624178827225
“Now, gentlemen,” said Athos, when he had ascertained there were five	343.9043313188349
chambers free in the hôtel, “let everyone retire to his own apartment.	345.60699612884235
D’Artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. I take charge of	343.0548763997321
everything; be easy.”	189.97769382997262
“It appears, however,” said Lord de Winter, “if there are any measures	329.6410656787986
to take against the countess, it concerns me; she is my sister-in-law.”	292.59314359059454
“And me,” said Athos, “—she is my wife!”	340.1847795359155
D’Artagnan smiled—for he understood that Athos was sure of his	171.42675287867885
vengeance when he revealed such a secret. Porthos and Aramis looked at	306.91129042744376
each other, and grew pale. Lord de Winter thought Athos was mad.	186.93614402930277
“Now, retire to your chambers,” said Athos, “and leave me to act. You	241.92744387871505
must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. Only,	364.8287858717329
D’Artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from	266.0404045673731
that man’s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of—”	351.60031347869676
“Ah,” said D’Artagnan, “I comprehend! that name written in her hand.”	355.212234999698
“You see, then,” said Athos, “there is a god in heaven still!”	277.8581300465011
Chapter LXIV.	282.90893232662023
THE MAN IN THE RED CLOAK	329.5096666950632
The despair of Athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only	230.04176941574593
rendered more lucid the brilliant mental faculties of that	274.9245609306348
extraordinary man.	293.63608667401263
Possessed by one single thought—that of the promise he had made, and of	351.5845714179843
the responsibility he had taken—he retired last to his chamber, begged	330.5236600278017
the host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined	350.8455030489944
every line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different	180.45563770879676
roads from Béthune to Armentières, and summoned the lackeys.	358.02350085557913
Planchet, Grimaud, Bazin, and Mousqueton presented themselves, and	201.3099289309539
received clear, positive, and serious orders from Athos.	220.60358594016145
They must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to	321.3439621492089
Armentières—each by a different route. Planchet, the most intelligent	171.84918616347318
of the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon	192.07336292358443
which the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be	183.66796005167475
remembered, by Rochefort’s servant.	198.875268945487
Athos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been	236.6122793454724
in the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of	274.817320767253
them different and essential qualities. Then, lackeys who ask questions	277.48617795319996
inspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among	205.0719727451703
those to whom they address themselves. Besides, Milady knew the	299.84711669481146
masters, and did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys	252.42315407213215
knew Milady perfectly.	268.67068936124565
All four were to meet the next day at eleven o’clock. If they had	281.5740839924562
discovered Milady’s retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth	308.4638797506276
was to return to Béthune in order to inform Athos and serve as a guide	288.27433024230345
to the four friends. These arrangements made, the lackeys retired.	278.0094202091974
Athos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself	345.5483474238568
in his cloak, and left the hôtel. It was nearly ten o’clock. At ten	238.92296179895436
o’clock in the evening, it is well known, the streets in provincial	349.9066400941608
towns are very little frequented. Athos nevertheless was visibly	213.22021827511776
anxious to find someone of whom he could ask a question. At length he	214.81855502771998
met a belated passenger, went up to him, and spoke a few words to him.	279.9440290456985
The man he addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few	250.88042710449164
words of the Musketeer by pointing. Athos offered the man half a	218.0602921479578
pistole to accompany him, but the man refused.	324.96939479949424
Athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his	179.786056443978
finger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly	351.3282681153007
embarrassed. Nevertheless, as the crossroads offered him a better	246.25681851577775
chance than any other place of meeting somebody, he stood still. In a	177.33237306708793
few minutes a night watch passed. Athos repeated to him the same	329.38930549846566
question he had asked the first person he met. The night watch evinced	306.54173550269
the same terror, refused, in his turn, to accompany Athos, and only	335.029253596311
pointed with his hand to the road he was to take.	180.4890045728543
Athos walked in the direction indicated, and reached the suburb	319.6302502982389
situated at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he	352.07075728538166
and his friends had entered it. There he again appeared uneasy and	290.0397696355091
embarrassed, and stopped for the third time.	169.97479176856828
Fortunately, a mendicant passed, who, coming up to Athos to ask	319.9624255590542
charity, Athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was	262.240907991296
going. The mendicant hesitated at first, but at the sight of the piece	229.78601706124425
of silver which shone in the darkness he consented, and walked on	234.8019239260367
before Athos.	321.7143807800418
Arrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house,	319.6647054723372
isolated, solitary, and dismal. Athos went toward the house, while the	285.3625518145373
mendicant, who had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could	314.15303906253155
carry him.	201.02707752813677
Athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid	321.0147165901643
the red color in which the house was painted. No light appeared through	184.4480414365619
the chinks of the shutters; no noise gave reason to believe that it was	218.87559475670753
inhabited. It was dark and silent as the tomb.	217.93453789452073
Three times Athos knocked without receiving an answer. At the third	219.34108771632657
knock, however, steps were heard inside. The door at length was opened,	277.3020095268604
and a man appeared, of high stature, pale complexion, and black hair	332.21013838346244
and beard.	305.8644609930974
Athos and he exchanged some words in a low voice, then the tall man	332.94436723890885
made a sign to the Musketeer that he might come in. Athos immediately	304.49692512367426
profited by the permission, and the door was closed behind him.	333.0608360353982
The man whom Athos had come so far to seek, and whom he had found with	320.42081311175684
so much trouble, introduced him into his laboratory, where he was	332.1001759824892
engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a	345.05220630997087
skeleton. All the frame was adjusted except the head, which lay on the	330.392027150242
table.	229.07099760073714
All the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house	262.99272248971835
occupied himself with the study of natural science. There were large	171.65019355534153
bottles filled with serpents, ticketed according to their species;	206.73688070502507
dried lizards shone like emeralds set in great squares of black wood,	218.54513624933045
and bunches of wild odoriferous herbs, doubtless possessed of virtues	257.11684414982267
unknown to common men, were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in	264.5481070019888
the corners of the apartment. There was no family, no servant; the tall	232.41276940233598
man alone inhabited this house.	322.8688786357087
Athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have	339.41236245936943
described, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down	207.1460595776399
near him.	256.1389569857854
Then he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he	292.83239611387586
required of him. But scarcely had he expressed his request when the	365.04001941106833
unknown, who remained standing before the Musketeer, drew back with	190.31064778594475
signs of terror, and refused. Then Athos took from his pocket a small	263.7294168126479
paper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and	195.5433184418032
a seal, and presented them to him who had made too prematurely these	242.27077193057244
signs of repugnance. The tall man had scarcely read these lines, seen	218.5850258120967
the signature, and recognized the seal, when he bowed to denote that he	272.64451826438074
had no longer any objection to make, and that he was ready to obey.	194.8834919018045
Athos required no more. He arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same	287.74040380687336
way he came, re-entered the hôtel, and went to his apartment.	318.1236378252172
At daybreak D’Artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be	251.88227434425636
done.	181.66054596914768
“To wait,” replied Athos.	244.8383842230692
Some minutes after, the superior of the convent sent to inform the	357.43706907803914
Musketeers that the burial would take place at midday. As to the	234.2821220259142
poisoner, they had heard no tidings of her whatever, only that she must	197.12702599937404
have made her escape through the garden, on the sand of which her	234.3489939711205
footsteps could be traced, and the door of which had been found shut.	182.95897869116254
As to the key, it had disappeared.	172.56609639486555
At the hour appointed, Lord de Winter and the four friends repaired to	183.58631168974622
the convent; the bells tolled, the chapel was open, the grating of the	191.26148838685484
choir was closed. In the middle of the choir the body of the victim,	276.9710595486214
clothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed. On each side of the choir	335.3652117100586
and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the	248.7872878540913
whole community of the Carmelites, who listened to the divine service,	195.76372253466252
and mingled their chant with the chant of the priests, without seeing	233.43716531050615
the profane, or being seen by them.	320.73834894106886
At the door of the chapel D’Artagnan felt his courage fall anew, and	230.84705281370105
returned to look for Athos; but Athos had disappeared.	298.9766930459451
Faithful to his mission of vengeance, Athos had requested to be	171.3740942455141
conducted to the garden; and there upon the sand following the light	194.94915887341364
steps of this woman, who left sharp tracks wherever she went, he	257.46819328612673
advanced toward the gate which led into the wood, and causing it to be	197.801533733793
opened, he went out into the forest.	203.80567898123937
Then all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage	296.3995749594232
had disappeared encircled the forest. Athos followed the road for some	273.10233409403526
time, his eyes fixed upon the ground; slight stains of blood, which	300.1839207617312
came from the wound inflicted upon the man who accompanied the carriage	297.57060368031443
as a courier, or from one of the horses, dotted the road. At the end of	340.2066099989816
three-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of Festubert, a larger	254.2004210335541
bloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. Between the	330.1349037635998
forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was	265.77545543471257
the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped	306.7906582528618
here. At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the	235.38974569357217
carriage.	191.69915840708993
Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos	243.27227467748625
returned to the hôtel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him.	238.43319930381784
Everything was as Athos had foreseen.	177.64342078623972
Planchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the	321.5288953599804
stains of blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had	199.95242436818648
halted. But he had gone farther than Athos—for at the village of	208.00780040244263
Festubert, while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to	323.09847582585314
ask a question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded	260.6033101841199
man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged	286.4190960286154
to stop, unable to go further. The accident was set down to the account	199.78597824180545
of robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood. The man remained in	337.1702803810282
the village; the woman had had a relay of horses, and continued her	311.77066045295885
journey.	317.6706458215481
Planchet went in search of the postillion who had driven her, and found	260.7652735683958
him. He had taken the lady as far as Fromelles; and from Fromelles she	328.54500104766396
had set out for Armentières. Planchet took the crossroad, and by seven	207.2459731795882
o’clock in the morning he was at Armentières.	238.4676630518661
There was but one tavern, the Post. Planchet went and presented himself	254.67656915051515
as a lackey out of a place, who was in search of a situation. He had	310.6569389238489
not chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned	195.18176910173136
that a woman had come there alone about eleven o’clock the night	288.2766142942612
before, had engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hôtel,	311.98081689065873
and told him she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.	197.22734846163954
Planchet had no need to learn more. He hastened to the rendezvous,	339.76344645371114
found the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the	184.98952604054332
outlets of the hôtel, and came to find Athos, who had just received	344.6735593866879
this information when his friends returned.	207.47870224176
All their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild	337.77992693947186
countenance of Aramis.	274.30603878970874
“What is to be done?” asked D’Artagnan.	290.66767867181113
“To wait!” replied Athos.	258.90707472699194
Each retired to his own apartment.	239.93302367772722
At eight o’clock in the evening Athos ordered the horses to be saddled,	297.8116271149054
and Lord de Winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for	325.58206038529215
the expedition.	320.95267953013604
In an instant all five were ready. Each examined his arms, and put them	273.82209544513387
in order. Athos came down last, and found D’Artagnan already on	214.54954857822787
horseback, and growing impatient.	317.5297549015018
“Patience!” cried Athos; “one of our party is still wanting.”	182.76843918895668
The four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought	171.1466553155598
vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.	287.0216161978593
At this moment Planchet brought out Athos’s horse; the Musketeer leaped	219.0030684337886
lightly into the saddle.	233.80825116678534
“Wait for me,” cried he, “I will soon be back,” and he set off at a	251.25944040859883
gallop.	296.0234765384117
In a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,	202.3441956818637
and wrapped in a large red cloak.	358.1486913919393
Lord de Winter and the three Musketeers looked at one another	259.48832533496943
inquiringly. Neither could give the others any information, for all	323.644811924938
were ignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced	207.4955840165506
that all was as it should be, as it was done by the order of Athos.	305.15964883632114
At nine o’clock, guided by Planchet, the little cavalcade set out,	235.6375659804891
taking the route the carriage had taken.	272.3173804461116
It was a melancholy sight—that of these six men, traveling in silence,	318.9129252421839
each plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as	282.1433024875977
chastisement.	251.5921539591783
Chapter LXV.	313.10865859733417
TRIAL	341.7089712366277
It was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,	189.71084022272711
concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.	170.3847377848873
Occasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along	199.56139201451322
the horizon, the road stretched itself before them, white and solitary;	293.1619177791482
the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.	176.4847513498122
Every minute Athos was forced to restrain D’Artagnan, constantly in	233.48924942326883
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which	257.315989268516
in an instant he again departed from. He had but one thought—to go	316.74704458984485
forward; and he went.	348.8651904683593
They passed in silence through the little village of Festubert, where	304.1951955642381
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of Richebourg. At	252.49668283155614
Herlier, Planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.	261.2640628000245
Several times Lord de Winter, Porthos, or Aramis tried to talk with the	262.28919345627594
man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him	300.7515994494072
he bowed, without response. The travelers then comprehended that there	227.07363231459843
must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and	238.501767079305
ceased to address themselves to him.	362.90632590259065
The storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly,	354.6867126674671
the thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,	334.1649991871193
whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.	339.76677932873145
The cavalcade trotted on more sharply.	241.78399652819937
A little before they came to Fromelles the storm burst. They spread	206.32830107534363
their cloaks. There remained three leagues to travel, and they did it	235.4974076793257
amid torrents of rain.	222.68884102784108
D’Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of	284.2827798468441
his cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his	282.8104865041261
burning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.	259.09013592704133
The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the	233.3340972225324
Post, a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk	319.9919170251811
with which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into	325.913405985069
the middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.	237.14646372776133
Athos recognized Grimaud.	297.57381187206386
“What’s the manner?” cried Athos. “Has she left Armentières?”	318.76245526617834
Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D’Artagnan ground his teeth.	212.10075156554126
“Silence, D’Artagnan!” said Athos. “I have charged myself with this	284.32089525420224
affair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.”	174.82078118350705
“Where is she?” asked Athos.	188.72157038300054
Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys. “Far from	204.83721295439875
here?” asked Athos.	311.63518460664693
Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.	315.4802970869523
“Alone?” asked Athos.	272.5478173573507
Grimaud made the sign yes.	203.64944542641348
“Gentlemen,” said Athos, “she is alone within half a league of us, in	295.1901828797596
the direction of the river.”	194.8897847735197
“That’s well,” said D’Artagnan. “Lead us, Grimaud.”	360.2615665034763
Grimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the	233.26331420730207
cavalcade.	210.12149778947213
At the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet,	350.1633488240114
which they forded.	218.581645149376
By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim.	349.8058110727463
“Is she there, Grimaud?” asked Athos.	196.0344413608648
Grimaud shook his head negatively.	279.0962238116616
“Silence, then!” cried Athos.	343.4627144797297
And the troop continued their route.	279.4966790123301
Another flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm,	211.59104475678316
and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a	183.2486124702071
little isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces	326.2909617437627
of a ferry.	359.9133674143584
One window was lighted.	345.54357608441444
“Here we are!” said Athos.	205.74211441331147
At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and	178.56783942473055
came towards them. It was Mousqueton. He pointed his finger to the	219.51324587197644
lighted window.	279.45626319605594
“She is there,” said he.	305.0758092983175
“And Bazin?” asked Athos.	311.7203943013883
“While I watched the window, he guarded the door.”	209.67824883874226
“Good!” said Athos. “You are good and faithful servants.”	295.7917143458161
Athos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to Grimaud, and advanced	240.1925168592379
toward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to	263.9371444610274
go toward the door.	235.65549894679293
The little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three	295.0739892755938
feet high. Athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which	284.1847057782962
was without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.	352.84695415912995
He mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the	230.00823476318521
curtain.	187.77506579412113
By the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated	292.39852431236045
upon a stool near a dying fire. Her elbows were placed upon a mean	274.62167418455
table, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as	252.9216192987429
ivory.	241.37636793910508
He could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed	264.129442360653
over the lips of Athos. He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.	240.23670807786797
At this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to	348.3965253183519
the panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed.	278.9957578974261
Athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee	286.0136804698755
and hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and	197.05300481808857
Athos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.	263.4430548239001
Milady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than	209.19679947094681
Athos, D’Artagnan stood on the threshold.	350.92241945737373
Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D’Artagnan, believing she might have	362.41965293784904
means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his	360.73518594119975
belt; but Athos raised his hand.	249.44107543765801
“Put back that weapon, D’Artagnan!” said he; “this woman must be tried,	356.64522017414504
not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be	255.87941359400193
satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.”	338.3510970050653
D’Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful	307.31771954103857
gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind D’Artagnan entered	225.5452255384053
Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak.	359.38959882496044
The four lackeys guarded the door and the window.	321.8103470763084
Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure	341.6630328908749
this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a	200.11445499492294
terrible cry.	252.5083336059448
“What do you want?” screamed Milady.	306.69003638814183
“We want,” said Athos, “Charlotte Backson, who first was called	314.31739601092954
Comtesse de la Fère, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of	217.28594754306604
Sheffield.”	261.77152221273445
“That is I! that is I!” murmured Milady, in extreme terror; “what do	250.36983138403488
you want?”	177.45141357994686
“We wish to judge you according to your crime,” said Athos; “you shall	175.7786220631507
be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d’Artagnan,	350.1551865810906
it is for you to accuse her first.”	201.1738396900198
D’Artagnan advanced.	289.7072643050756
“Before God and before men,” said he, “I accuse this woman of having	311.8439091106692
poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.”	297.5794002251421
He turned towards Porthos and Aramis.	300.2691679879764
“We bear witness to this,” said the two Musketeers, with one voice.	197.87022576141516
D’Artagnan continued: “Before God and before men, I accuse this woman	325.74588517356597
of having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from	271.02649314341534
Villeroy, with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends.	266.8074923147811
God preserved me, but a man named Brisemont died in my place.”	265.6126923564373
“We bear witness to this,” said Porthos and Aramis, in the same manner	289.06095095256813
as before.	236.3462879578731
“Before God and before men, I accuse this woman of having urged me to	194.43109678135062
the murder of the Baron de Wardes; but as no one else can attest the	364.0668990451726
truth of this accusation, I attest it myself. I have done.” And	303.84700838738706
D’Artagnan passed to the other side of the room with Porthos and	304.6282292744395
Aramis.	263.8941484171429
“Your turn, my Lord,” said Athos.	174.09891158701842
The baron came forward.	259.9147689129594
“Before God and before men,” said he, “I accuse this woman of having	210.03914255449737
caused the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham.”	349.02654324168196
“The Duke of Buckingham assassinated!” cried all present, with one	334.1062719257525
voice.	221.5304053114229
“Yes,” said the baron, “assassinated. On receiving the warning letter	354.28328999986604
you wrote to me, I had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a	267.2362251098227
loyal servant. She corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his	229.87704649598513
hand; she made him kill the duke. And at this moment, perhaps, Felton	301.80449585431904
is paying with his head for the crime of this fury!”	330.27291402987566
A shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown	259.4796467914169
crimes.	328.3045742253764
“That is not all,” resumed Lord de Winter. “My brother, who made you	277.8843097120041
his heir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid	182.02817258064155
traces all over the body. My sister, how did your husband die?”	224.68155676462985
“Horror!” cried Porthos and Aramis.	217.919723031137
“Assassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I	229.84191334328327
demand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I	312.87184233619763
will execute it myself.”	302.0341291812081
And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of D’Artagnan, leaving	249.00688941205885
the place free for another accuser.	334.97060709055654
Milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her	188.99066257931824
ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.	353.40184556705066
“My turn,” said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the	307.57018891719895
sight of the serpent—“my turn. I married that woman when she was a	233.53593630150718
young girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family;	343.5717010251004
I gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that	353.9879869945676
this woman was branded—this woman was marked with a _fleur-de-lis_ on	358.7055388342196
her left shoulder.”	347.37305312320115
“Oh,” said Milady, raising herself, “I defy you to find any tribunal	312.2632984156693
which pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find	281.09510830176845
him who executed it.”	219.205921658652
“Silence!” said a hollow voice. “It is for me to reply to that!” And	247.27335810647372
the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn.	332.4738039112649
“What man is that? What man is that?” cried Milady, suffocated by	314.16452931812887
terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid	254.21871734946097
countenance as if alive.	307.0108724718598
All eyes were turned towards this man—for to all except Athos he was	349.6470016333048
unknown.	199.42882802078955
Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for	332.9242920309893
he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the	335.8462410057217
horrible drama then unfolded.	329.69442958097306
After approaching Milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table	211.3489318779949
alone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.	335.8584247702783
Milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face,	324.8710886024359
framed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was	288.1546176110736
icy impassibility. Then she suddenly cried, “Oh, no, no!” rising and	305.9790239315565
retreating to the very wall. “No, no! it is an infernal apparition! It	352.01740502260714
is not he! Help, help!” screamed she, turning towards the wall, as if	361.55638967507593
she would tear an opening with her hands.	294.4277747259896
“Who are you, then?” cried all the witnesses of this scene.	184.97619545142754
“Ask that woman,” said the man in the red cloak, “for you may plainly	270.09008647799874
see she knows me!”	193.94694074514877
“The executioner of Lille, the executioner of Lille!” cried Milady, a	345.16054801911594
prey to insensate terror, and clinging with her hands to the wall to	300.2244482919721
avoid falling.	233.36263076191753
Everyone drew back, and the man in the red cloak remained standing	337.5657521124771
alone in the middle of the room.	276.0478003758555
“Oh, grace, grace, pardon!” cried the wretch, falling on her knees.	276.2015756781717
The unknown waited for silence, and then resumed, “I told you well that	363.42444831753573
she would know me. Yes, I am the executioner of Lille, and this is my	229.98170603368953
history.”	178.8160962132103
All eyes were fixed upon this man, whose words were listened to with	275.9725493193399
anxious attention.	336.30885297467137
“That woman was once a young girl, as beautiful as she is today. She	282.4308618098694
was a nun in the convent of the Benedictines of Templemar. A young	300.6554284791061
priest, with a simple and trustful heart, performed the duties of the	337.52312076429945
church of that convent. She undertook his seduction, and succeeded; she	168.25759967139678
would have seduced a saint.	264.8789884447627
“Their vows were sacred and irrevocable. Their connection could not	307.32434675383183
last long without ruining both. She prevailed upon him to leave the	194.11110157891454
country; but to leave the country, to fly together, to reach another	327.3888165887481
part of France, where they might live at ease because unknown, money	327.5659364097104
was necessary. Neither had any. The priest stole the sacred vases, and	179.66645113042492
sold them; but as they were preparing to escape together, they were	228.4505597478835
both arrested.	241.35088446260073
“Eight days later she had seduced the son of the jailer, and escaped.	232.26921282920614
The young priest was condemned to ten years of imprisonment, and to be	300.1227204734489
branded. I was executioner of the city of Lille, as this woman has	298.22392415973366
said. I was obliged to brand the guilty one; and he, gentlemen, was my	338.23759837567843
brother!	218.34803277458153
“I then swore that this woman who had ruined him, who was more than his	331.3282901713027
accomplice, since she had urged him to the crime, should at least share	344.191074501059
his punishment. I suspected where she was concealed. I followed her, I	209.34168360062176
caught her, I bound her; and I imprinted the same disgraceful mark upon	261.056446308466
her that I had imprinted upon my poor brother.	351.3154002961103
“The day after my return to Lille, my brother in his turn succeeded in	336.54842962313444
making his escape; I was accused of complicity, and was condemned to	250.96456965471629
remain in his place till he should be again a prisoner. My poor brother	196.85209915865752
was ignorant of this sentence. He rejoined this woman; they fled	205.63620252045456
together into Berry, and there he obtained a little curacy. This woman	354.42975959360217
passed for his sister.	196.95100160686627
“The Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated	219.33717530407534
saw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her—amorous to such a	300.1268662279318
degree that he proposed to marry her. Then she quitted him she had	220.77823412793563
ruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the Comtesse de la	192.68397513547527
Fère—”	172.84544940575458
All eyes were turned towards Athos, whose real name that was, and who	215.6219167084397
made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had	203.10854841561292
said.	351.68093367278937
“Then,” resumed he, “mad, desperate, determined to get rid of an	287.8374102839291
existence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness, my	283.56335586907977
poor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had	325.76956073669845
condemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that	269.9211809282907
same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.	274.48331266910014
“To do justice to them who had condemned me, they kept their word. As	273.8923048545347
soon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty.	348.18616646604164
“That is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which	321.01584932985753
she was branded.”	254.15866979943272
“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Athos, “what is the penalty you demand	358.6791662456242
against this woman?”	320.28969299073117
“The punishment of death,” replied D’Artagnan.	270.490741439922
“My Lord de Winter,” continued Athos, “what is the penalty you demand	277.23755060704156
against this woman?”	281.2716094598959
“The punishment of death,” replied Lord de Winter.	351.14510770179083
“Messieurs Porthos and Aramis,” repeated Athos, “you who are her	191.21219495425734
judges, what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?”	171.62489050955105
“The punishment of death,” replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice.	236.61011801854784
Milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several	222.642613554873
paces upon her knees toward her judges.	173.2381415083513
Athos stretched out his hand toward her.	324.3527993933695
“Charlotte Backson, Comtesse de la Fère, Milady de Winter,” said he,	309.04833283781375
“your crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven. If you know a	296.3537569025118
prayer, say it—for you are condemned, and you shall die.”	246.97697555574427
At these words, which left no hope, Milady raised herself in all her	192.35164890110926
pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. She felt that	305.09737543413837
a powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her	316.94362483185716
away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. She did not, therefore,	259.8191175207229
even attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.	315.53579181335016
Lord de Winter, D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, went out close	349.5341071825379
behind her. The lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was	336.0675467358567
left solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky	181.5804165058707
lamp burning sadly on the table.	301.33437086875415
Chapter LXVI.	168.8640142820143
EXECUTION	323.45910769106973
It was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened	228.14571418745217
by the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of	321.86813420951125
Armentières, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of	277.9884289148638
its houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. In front of them the	167.36324764670647
Lys rolled its waters like a river of molten tin; while on the other	298.7456879504309
side was a black mass of trees, profiled on a stormy sky, invaded by	308.30690000538954
large coppery clouds which created a sort of twilight amid the night.	308.1900838425646
On the left was an old abandoned mill, with its motionless wings, from	210.27002271550438
the ruins of which an owl threw out its shrill, periodical, and	347.71320833425364
monotonous cry. On the right and on the left of the road, which the	209.8862567543913
dismal procession pursued, appeared a few low, stunted trees, which	186.02402309237925
looked like deformed dwarfs crouching down to watch men traveling at	350.63647319174834
this sinister hour.	264.3990166731955
From time to time a broad sheet of lightning opened the horizon in its	363.68593130118234
whole width, darted like a serpent over the black mass of trees, and	222.7839683170523
like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two	270.3014771467018
parts. Not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. A	210.76892850201676
deathlike silence oppressed all nature. The soil was humid and	213.41515982682802
glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed	210.8645935358073
herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.	214.536322082644
Two lackeys dragged Milady, whom each held by one arm. The executioner	304.8531940516249
walked behind them, and Lord de Winter, D’Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis	174.31619594894818
walked behind the executioner. Planchet and Bazin came last.	275.9306554184791
The two lackeys conducted Milady to the bank of the river. Her mouth	227.98364261455183
was mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,	358.8514265554145
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.	197.73308312013572
Being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, “A thousand	347.84181707773416
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you	310.4099685941957
deliver me up to your masters, I have near at hand avengers who will	311.03404587005525
make you pay dearly for my death.”	351.16744349332873
Grimaud hesitated. Mousqueton trembled in all his members.	325.5356008001491
Athos, who heard Milady’s voice, came sharply up. Lord de Winter did	321.28905627430913
the same.	168.2234895014448
“Change these lackeys,” said he; “she has spoken to them. They are no	336.4495806998134
longer sure.”	342.3443411526399
Planchet and Bazin were called, and took the places of Grimaud and	293.7545497412881
Mousqueton.	228.00266664489433
On the bank of the river the executioner approached Milady, and bound	232.59895677007762
her hands and feet.	315.0560674580677
Then she broke the silence to cry out, “You are cowards, miserable	279.7972396364931
assassins—ten men combined to murder one woman. Beware! If I am not	173.8757011645223
saved I shall be avenged.”	341.52091911919143
“You are not a woman,” said Athos, coldly and sternly. “You do not	270.6694609172237
belong to the human species; you are a demon escaped from hell, whither	327.7026965064937
we send you back again.”	346.4772575428741
“Ah, you virtuous men!” said Milady; “please to remember that he who	294.34898572194834
shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin.”	190.54331663158206
“The executioner may kill, without being on that account an assassin,”	262.3209949319201
said the man in the red cloak, rapping upon his immense sword. “This is	283.4861490900489
the last judge; that is all. _Nachrichter_, as say our neighbors, the	184.88787679442922
Germans.”	266.5942609199138
And as he bound her while saying these words, Milady uttered two or	266.41331489974186
three savage cries, which produced a strange and melancholy effect in	202.42861272851943
flying away into the night, and losing themselves in the depths of the	256.0398023721761
woods.	275.8291634393004
“If I am guilty, if I have committed the crimes you accuse me of,”	296.6800984636511
shrieked Milady, “take me before a tribunal. You are not judges! You	196.1469109013083
cannot condemn me!”	250.63402152253377
“I offered you Tyburn,” said Lord de Winter. “Why did you not accept	358.5799495981205
it?”	314.1630416092815
“Because I am not willing to die!” cried Milady, struggling. “Because I	251.41460308940083
am too young to die!”	311.2531552003379
“The woman you poisoned at Béthune was still younger than you, madame,	242.2000823205293
and yet she is dead,” said D’Artagnan.	331.52575783915995
“I will enter a cloister; I will become a nun,” said Milady.	315.9814890479736
“You were in a cloister,” said the executioner, “and you left it to	351.44622873843775
ruin my brother.”	277.1771563324546
Milady uttered a cry of terror and sank upon her knees. The executioner	204.8217624714199
took her up in his arms and was carrying her toward the boat.	219.7018223384516
“Oh, my God!” cried she, “my God! are you going to drown me?”	357.07439263874073
These cries had something so heartrending in them that M. d’Artagnan,	349.543802704883
who had been at first the most eager in pursuit of Milady, sat down on	221.9303718495957
the stump of a tree and hung his head, covering his ears with the palms	364.5559584969547
of his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and	360.1957682063518
threaten.	285.1700756983038
D’Artagnan was the youngest of all these men. His heart failed him.	167.95832179284417
“Oh, I cannot behold this frightful spectacle!” said he. “I cannot	242.17340924545329
consent that this woman should die thus!”	285.4774286641051
Milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope.	268.881673087856
“D’Artagnan, D’Artagnan!” cried she; “remember that I loved you!”	251.03035524720417
The young man rose and took a step toward her.	234.5090551643322
But Athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.	187.37904159062222
“If you take one step farther, D’Artagnan,” said he, “we shall cross	360.0577815339486
swords together.”	319.8236595518081
D’Artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.	231.8168432978568
“Come,” continued Athos, “executioner, do your duty.”	322.9809245844884
“Willingly, monseigneur,” said the executioner; “for as I am a good	229.5672329016029
Catholic, I firmly believe I am acting justly in performing my	300.5482878525688
functions on this woman.”	264.6139067294707
“That’s well.”	309.5664554101836
Athos made a step toward Milady.	341.7315840703798
“I pardon you,” said he, “the ill you have done me. I pardon you for my	183.6368691707499
blasted future, my lost honor, my defiled love, and my salvation	358.52663654966796
forever compromised by the despair into which you have cast me. Die in	315.99801995382415
peace!”	258.61440927547034
Lord de Winter advanced in his turn.	257.89745477135733
“I pardon you,” said he, “for the poisoning of my brother, and the	206.34683248058496
assassination of his Grace, Lord Buckingham. I pardon you for the death	271.4118342328608
of poor Felton; I pardon you for the attempts upon my own person. Die	254.80656134030403
in peace!”	181.26447533021718
“And I,” said M. d’Artagnan. “Pardon me, madame, for having by a trick	199.75733788727564
unworthy of a gentleman provoked your anger; and I, in exchange, pardon	287.20515561644675
you the murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me. I	189.9827731035338
pardon you, and I weep for you. Die in peace!”	219.01905869602862
“I am lost!” murmured Milady in English. “I must die!”	340.08311470832024
Then she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing	299.03491920985465
looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.	168.0862210358239
She saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.	305.7700277775064
“Where am I to die?” said she.	270.7027733890872
“On the other bank,” replied the executioner.	232.9944678216862
Then he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it	232.92609377077378
himself, Athos handed him a sum of silver.	335.5030062951562
“Here,” said he, “is the price of the execution, that it may be plain	184.07458823721092
we act as judges.”	360.05365153000366
“That is correct,” said the executioner; “and now in her turn, let this	351.00728341523586
woman see that I am not fulfilling my trade, but my debt.”	199.44439556208633
And he threw the money into the river.	292.7664461928691
The boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the Lys, bearing the	345.6956799390254
guilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the	226.92298442379928
right-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.	230.72761592365663
The boat glided along the ferry rope under the shadow of a pale cloud	257.8768373227043
which hung over the water at that moment.	305.4298448915066
The troop of friends saw it gain the opposite bank; the figures were	241.80269094835546
defined like black shadows on the red-tinted horizon.	334.79560971303835
Milady, during the passage had contrived to untie the cord which	264.8651694191792
fastened her feet. On coming near the bank, she jumped lightly on shore	269.69848883620335
and took to flight. But the soil was moist; on reaching the top of the	204.10574042219616
bank, she slipped and fell upon her knees.	351.2134484406014
She was struck, no doubt, with a superstitious idea; she conceived that	172.61851562480814
heaven denied its aid, and she remained in the attitude in which she	290.7295282480824
had fallen, her head drooping and her hands clasped.	355.2105595689503
Then they saw from the other bank the executioner raise both his arms	302.80589195809176
slowly; a moonbeam fell upon the blade of the large sword. The two arms	324.09580636500834
fell with a sudden force; they heard the hissing of the scimitar and	228.47642695892628
the cry of the victim, then a truncated mass sank beneath the blow.	322.3512938289517
The executioner then took off his red cloak, spread it upon the ground,	223.79242334685512
laid the body in it, threw in the head, tied all up by the four	318.37140347098307
corners, lifted it on his back, and entered the boat again.	336.9039498618242
In the middle of the stream he stopped the boat, and suspending his	325.80091434484206
burden over the water cried in a loud voice, “Let the justice of God be	211.36098812555366
done!” and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters, which	173.23781455390687
closed over it.	336.42515331428484
Three days afterward the four Musketeers were in Paris; they had not	330.3565182639927
exceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay	223.63474775747497
their customary visit to M. de Tréville.	214.33886382584433
“Well, gentlemen,” said the brave captain, “I hope you have been well	166.80031859730454
amused during your excursion.”	209.07568649398735
“Prodigiously,” replied Athos in the name of himself and his comrades.	184.44385901498842
Chapter LXVII.	333.0048962258168
CONCLUSION	221.55702051237435
On the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the	320.8447433612512
promise he had made the cardinal to return to La Rochelle, left his	365.5460327419612
capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of	327.56487132038546
Buckingham’s assassination.	321.78327149732905
Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger,	234.32824719138927
the queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the	226.98209856464976
fact, and even imprudently exclaimed, “it is false; he has just written	324.915686301275
to me!”	219.21860605581108
But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence;	310.20852102354024
Laporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders	238.33434474572422
of Charles I., arrived, and was the bearer of the duke’s dying gift to	180.55622734372682
the queen.	187.922517974852
The joy of the king was lively. He did not even give himself the	296.6508475914061
trouble to dissemble, and displayed it with affectation before the	188.02332650751427
queen. Louis XIII., like every weak mind, was wanting in generosity.	331.8494209671688
But the king soon again became dull and indisposed; his brow was not	233.75815172890754
one of those that long remain clear. He felt that in returning to camp	261.86100674482077
he should re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.	322.066340984563
The cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird	261.7252598198173
which flies from branch to branch without power to escape.	354.9129160769211
The return to La Rochelle, therefore, was profoundly dull. Our four	298.0792778767743
friends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled	223.8087115631841
together, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered. Athos alone	331.3533787582488
from time to time raised his expansive brow; a flash kindled in his	181.02101272277224
eyes, and a bitter smile passed over his lips, then, like his comrades,	171.55749284512675
he sank again into reverie.	352.6669051920714
As soon as the escort arrived in a city, when they had conducted the	323.9707042013279
king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to	272.7754992891394
some secluded cabaret, where they neither drank nor played; they only	238.38156090801576
conversed in a low voice, looking around attentively to see that no one	195.72469939844427
overheard them.	334.764503529277
One day, when the king had halted to fly the magpie, and the four	227.58035631008593
friends, according to their custom, instead of following the sport had	299.7615632196994
stopped at a cabaret on the high road, a man coming from la Rochelle on	338.68690684871467
horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine, and darted a	348.70620352323505
searching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting.	245.76958699833617
“Holloa, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” said he, “is not that you whom I see	224.05694980798341
yonder?”	279.0004180220359
D’Artagnan raised his head and uttered a cry of joy. It was the man he	330.97606837311275
called his phantom; it was his stranger of Meung, of the Rue des	259.8698371680615
Fossoyeurs and of Arras.	172.71970203744726
D’Artagnan drew his sword, and sprang toward the door.	223.9481566057035
But this time, instead of avoiding him the stranger jumped from his	226.5737197942339
horse, and advanced to meet D’Artagnan.	243.1874214671929
“Ah, monsieur!” said the young man, “I meet you, then, at last! This	187.46373351246103
time you shall not escape me!”	221.49242276186322
“Neither is it my intention, monsieur, for this time I was seeking you;	201.8938892894606
in the name of the king, I arrest you.”	266.5837610958316
“How! what do you say?” cried D’Artagnan.	344.4413713168063
“I say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that	271.79863174723545
without resistance. This concerns your head, I warn you.”	255.95289048506547
“Who are you, then?” demanded D’Artagnan, lowering the point of his	179.58626114645284
sword, but without yet surrendering it.	219.43823478853017
“I am the Chevalier de Rochefort,” answered the other, “the equerry of	312.5732012828764
Monsieur le Cardinal Richelieu, and I have orders to conduct you to his	233.88047097225092
Eminence.”	281.9437628206257
“We are returning to his Eminence, monsieur the Chevalier,” said Athos,	172.0290704489228
advancing; “and you will please to accept the word of Monsieur	274.5463247694607
d’Artagnan that he will go straight to La Rochelle.”	188.00988474993687
“I must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp.”	252.5357433577965
“We will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but	213.8316650723672
likewise, upon our word as gentlemen,” added Athos, knitting his brow,	326.1357870938671
“Monsieur d’Artagnan shall not leave us.”	341.2375949475428
The Chevalier de Rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that Porthos	268.9794839099288
and Aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he	261.674437312708
understood that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.	216.311210888118
“Gentlemen,” said he, “if Monsieur d’Artagnan will surrender his sword	256.9922534730044
to me and join his word to yours, I shall be satisfied with your	188.85123403016416
promise to convey Monsieur d’Artagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur	197.60476240604854
the Cardinal.”	219.73146585505765
“You have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword.”	352.7253060170789
“This suits me the better,” said Rochefort, “as I wish to continue my	323.5544796947347
journey.”	337.36687634842605
“If it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady,” said Athos, coolly, “it	316.2533309638055
is useless; you will not find her.”	262.0547712804924
“What has become of her, then?” asked Rochefort, eagerly.	299.06214827597563
“Return to camp and you shall know.”	351.5821598796492
Rochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a	247.3950205921646
day’s journey from Surgères, whither the cardinal was to come to meet	365.4366632215043
the king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them.	244.8048011117064
Besides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his	306.036931098844
prisoner.	244.4744071694061
They resumed their route.	261.6585137728941
On the morrow, at three o’clock in the afternoon, they arrived at	285.32884526366996
Surgères. The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the	255.4197143605105
king exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the	197.5253255210619
fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who	180.7378664474436
set all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been	310.88659412042546
informed that D’Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him,	325.54344433802135
took leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the	275.51915437358434
work already done upon the dyke.	252.42605790212346
On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre,	345.2632289427431
the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, D’Artagnan,	332.0315933545494
without his sword, and the three Musketeers armed.	286.20923681129193
This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made	350.3413259395808
a sign with his eye and hand for D’Artagnan to follow him.	259.1172709036566
D’Artagnan obeyed.	324.5484567403239
“We shall wait for you, D’Artagnan,” said Athos, loud enough for the	220.76021011702028
cardinal to hear him.	222.61358755054385
His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on	324.689009414016
his way without uttering a single word.	287.69092879647786
D’Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind D’Artagnan the door	231.9322362849059
was guarded.	290.6830758722352
His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made	287.91652090958655
a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer.	240.28764972883832
Rochefort obeyed and retired.	246.121779721881
D’Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second	310.38950602024806
interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well	257.4797655132617
assured it would be his last.	327.3373618259237
Richelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table	305.4180181557457
was between him and D’Artagnan.	244.27132524336568
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “you have been arrested by my orders.”	309.90539486074965
“So they tell me, monseigneur.”	231.6980882021077
“Do you know why?”	261.2067198200069
“No, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is	250.12002144867057
still unknown to your Eminence.”	211.37934858772113
Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man.	219.95376191720268
“Holloa!” said he, “what does that mean?”	284.3728065299989
“If Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place,	298.34569921753973
what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have	242.9517390067508
really done.”	211.63815584993768
“Crimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads	290.334782109286
than yours, monsieur,” said the cardinal.	301.2242539772392
“What, monseigneur?” said D’Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished	190.5887200524455
the cardinal himself.	267.61665272623424
“You are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the	354.90994280514803
kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are	237.97519349675918
charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.”	204.59831674703736
“And who charges me with this, monseigneur?” said D’Artagnan, who had	293.3341174324725
no doubt the accusation came from Milady, “a woman branded by the	227.94400034590365
justice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and	349.0902060905905
another in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who	259.25571509283833
attempted both to poison and assassinate me!”	267.1298108845456
“What do you say, monsieur?” cried the cardinal, astonished; “and of	291.16363915211895
what woman are you speaking thus?”	233.01999021557765
“Of Milady de Winter,” replied D’Artagnan, “yes, of Milady de Winter,	244.63675790564378
of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have	179.32812308021016
honored her with your confidence.”	316.33870853373037
“Monsieur,” said the cardinal, “if Milady de Winter has committed the	179.32698735319173
crimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.”	353.6925864145844
“She has been punished, monseigneur.”	241.40957594212267
“And who has punished her?”	295.56597305130504
“We.”	303.035419148193
“She is in prison?”	296.81767233051914
“She is dead.”	314.62354993886146
“Dead!” repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard,	360.6188255440289
“dead! Did you not say she was dead?”	213.10279208682292
“Three times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she	263.53861465898717
murdered the woman I loved. Then my friends and I took her, tried her,	279.9299902709764
and condemned her.”	309.3940695615849
D’Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme. Bonacieux in the convent	338.09490951435123
of the Carmelites at Béthune, the trial in the isolated house, and the	238.67724093526996
execution on the banks of the Lys.	174.23569663521582
A shudder crept through the body of the cardinal, who did not shudder	264.3471594667012
readily.	306.1359219106007
But all at once, as if undergoing the influence of an unspoken thought,	176.3696946660876
the countenance of the cardinal, till then gloomy, cleared up by	363.0655001774195
degrees, and recovered perfect serenity.	251.0248224983794
“So,” said the cardinal, in a tone that contrasted strongly with the	270.8652799576967
severity of his words, “you have constituted yourselves judges, without	238.28622330104048
remembering that they who punish without license to punish are	340.4159571956748
assassins?”	197.49075870853943
“Monseigneur, I swear to you that I never for an instant had the	326.6132259494005
intention of defending my head against you. I willingly submit to any	174.02914118519996
punishment your Eminence may please to inflict upon me. I do not hold	197.38403389455408
life dear enough to be afraid of death.”	215.08466401572747
“Yes, I know you are a man of a stout heart, monsieur,” said the	340.55435043108525
cardinal, with a voice almost affectionate; “I can therefore tell you	351.42712508704483
beforehand you shall be tried, and even condemned.”	285.7947129205326
“Another might reply to your Eminence that he had his pardon in his	330.48497285847
pocket. I content myself with saying: Command, monseigneur; I am	216.2504839056867
ready.”	195.2813988815708
“Your pardon?” said Richelieu, surprised.	311.2151519696331
“Yes, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan.	213.94367978611132
“And signed by whom—by the king?” And the cardinal pronounced these	357.7899942343327
words with a singular expression of contempt.	330.8138613314753
“No, by your Eminence.”	286.4042116380336
“By me? You are insane, monsieur.”	255.39061371060725
“Monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting.”	229.00913301900965
And D’Artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper	351.1638460937197
which Athos had forced from Milady, and which he had given to	167.83234823293552
D’Artagnan to serve him as a safeguard.	286.68001640726527
His Eminence took the paper, and read in a slow voice, dwelling upon	356.69966678727485
every syllable:	282.97464401501907
“Dec. 3, 1627	178.46078432276047
“It is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of	356.5175925196537
this has done what he has done.	242.510985189395
“RICHELIEU”	357.50854935704876
The cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound	317.39520462932774
reverie; but he did not return the paper to D’Artagnan.	294.6885806439068
“He is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me to die,”	338.6684848497418
said the Gascon to himself. “Well, my faith! he shall see how a	257.0939760838922
gentleman can die.”	301.37735428594385
The young Musketeer was in excellent disposition to die heroically.	335.2353934873228
Richelieu still continued thinking, rolling and unrolling the paper in	259.92804790485053
his hands.	168.1786630354127
At length he raised his head, fixed his eagle look upon that loyal,	234.55723906171013
open, and intelligent countenance, read upon that face, furrowed with	279.0974338745134
tears, all the sufferings its possessor had endured in the course of a	207.81724817477334
month, and reflected for the third or fourth time how much there was in	348.61937269676116
that youth of twenty-one years before him, and what resources his	270.73323052069094
activity, his courage, and his shrewdness might offer to a good master.	195.26094180632458
On the other side, the crimes, the power, and the infernal genius of	310.395075327429
Milady had more than once terrified him. He felt something like a	308.6563713433894
secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice.	278.8960381554016
Richelieu slowly tore the paper which D’Artagnan had generously	233.29067646808147
relinquished.	310.0833151609859
“I am lost!” said D’Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before	335.62966588677097
the cardinal, like a man who says, “Lord, Thy will be done!”	317.0464559412926
The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a	261.52642392078724
few lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and	313.85982889268763
affixed his seal.	346.17513097557526
“That is my condemnation,” thought D’Artagnan; “he will spare me the	270.3324191711062
_ennui_ of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That’s very	336.23018125864337
kind of him.”	352.0291744273289
“Here, monsieur,” said the cardinal to the young man. “I have taken	229.16844134156588
from you one _carte blanche_ to give you another. The name is wanting	335.7598734746001
in this commission; you can write it yourself.”	168.64127883468845
D’Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it	283.5317049906093
was a lieutenant’s commission in the Musketeers.	292.43305193840183
D’Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal.	318.64299562225943
“Monseigneur,” said he, “my life is yours; henceforth dispose of it.	228.03068452231952
But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three	255.21960142971852
friends who are more meritorious and more worthy—”	166.65109032826717
“You are a brave youth, D’Artagnan,” interrupted the cardinal, tapping	348.48915793979734
him familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this	248.20949820038524
rebellious nature. “Do with this commission what you will; only	347.5529229116873
remember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.”	329.9137811637302
“I shall never forget it,” replied D’Artagnan. “Your Eminence may be	206.93774821094638
certain of that.”	264.06343529546757
The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice, “Rochefort!” The	234.09103217344295
chevalier, who no doubt was near the door, entered immediately.	167.10686700855172
“Rochefort,” said the cardinal, “you see Monsieur d’Artagnan. I receive	343.1493988396023
him among the number of my friends. Greet each other, then; and be wise	196.0635747043092
if you wish to preserve your heads.”	289.66386709251714
Rochefort and D’Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but	249.8858366628611
the cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.	217.47581029367288
They left the chamber at the same time.	307.66596246068565
“We shall meet again, shall we not, monsieur?”	343.98589271061695
“When you please,” said D’Artagnan.	214.56730056351668
“An opportunity will come,” replied Rochefort.	236.886368906925
“Hey?” said the cardinal, opening the door.	248.96582778325148
The two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his	361.38974364676983
Eminence.	257.52813745414517
“We were beginning to grow impatient,” said Athos.	277.0451332464787
“Here I am, my friends,” replied D’Artagnan; “not only free, but in	181.50483404509515
favor.”	267.31667577790375
“Tell us about it.”	300.7823797535166
“This evening; but for the moment, let us separate.”	356.88415617467695
Accordingly, that same evening D’Artagnan repaired to the quarters of	194.49879665603075
Athos, whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of Spanish wine—an	265.69696929915983
occupation which he religiously accomplished every night.	203.66926153427247
D’Artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and	354.02481253307343
himself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, “Here, my	210.76541042956612
dear Athos, this naturally belongs to you.”	225.4350010937298
Athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles.	359.5774124578267
“Friend,” said he, “for Athos this is too much; for the Comte de la	344.916762073643
Fère it is too little. Keep the commission; it is yours. Alas! you have	288.3258731573619
purchased it dearly enough.”	181.97245330606262
D’Artagnan left Athos’s chamber and went to that of Porthos. He found	253.708729934901
him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,	354.8031651948101
admiring himself before a glass.	219.50339106311546
“Ah, ah! is that you, dear friend?” exclaimed Porthos. “How do you	280.1159832221009
think these garments fit me?”	192.4388602774907
“Wonderfully,” said D’Artagnan; “but I come to offer you a dress which	359.8081480430644
will become you still better.”	261.91867657545123
“What?” asked Porthos.	360.34874133431555
“That of a lieutenant of Musketeers.”	282.8114472543165
D’Artagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the	343.06962600087337
cardinal, and said, taking the commission from his pocket, “Here, my	221.19765785031217
friend, write your name upon it and become my chief.”	300.67056848952456
Porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to	249.74399595554036
D’Artagnan, to the great astonishment of the young man.	305.6511524071642
“Yes,” said he, “yes, that would flatter me very much; but I should not	290.7887404083582
have time enough to enjoy the distinction. During our expedition to	295.607000649322
Béthune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the	249.5042133346638
defunct holding out its arms to me, I shall marry the widow. Look here!	216.15174259236156
I was trying on my wedding suit. Keep the lieutenancy, my dear, keep	270.7423945688796
it.”	199.16409101892538
The young man then entered the apartment of Aramis. He found him	323.84012342978997
kneeling before a _priedieu_, with his head leaning on an open prayer	352.202829124968
book.	208.1742011556193
He described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the	258.7833243715041
third time drawing his commission from his pocket, “You, our friend,	308.2147435521878
our intelligence, our invisible protector, accept this commission. You	194.34504189969783
have merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels,	212.70378126295446
always followed by such happy results.”	175.4262056288063
“Alas, dear friend!” said Aramis, “our late adventures have disgusted	180.5619853941995
me with military life. This time my determination is irrevocably taken.	245.6765896612875
After the siege I shall enter the house of the Lazarists. Keep the	351.66853746765094
commission, D’Artagnan; the profession of arms suits you. You will be a	216.7932103899757
brave and adventurous captain.”	215.75931524917854
D’Artagnan, his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy, went	342.62121660641606
back to Athos, whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of	249.4283056536286
his last glass of Malaga by the light of his lamp.	310.59944306173014
“Well,” said he, “they likewise have refused me.”	313.37181581444065
“That, dear friend, is because nobody is more worthy than yourself.”	316.54042569510557
He took a quill, wrote the name of D’Artagnan in the commission, and	363.5418268870736
returned it to him.	222.15932076691254
“I shall then have no more friends,” said the young man. “Alas! nothing	194.00646034892424
but bitter recollections.”	358.80372680316304
And he let his head sink upon his hands, while two large tears rolled	331.38466947756046
down his cheeks.	283.5404123097709
“You are young,” replied Athos; “and your bitter recollections have	332.3535085827965
time to change themselves into sweet remembrances.”	214.46815356790486
EPILOGUE	205.87344508035028
La Rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the English fleet and of the	306.5977884927437
diversion promised by Buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.	214.00280770153455
On the twenty-eighth of October, 1628, the capitulation was signed.	191.15642925904504
The king made his entrance into Paris on the twenty-third of December	201.27509493659358
of the same year. He was received in triumph, as if he came from	193.1995320560827
conquering an enemy and not Frenchmen. He entered by the Faubourg St.	228.6971166752355
Jacques, under verdant arches.	179.14906807111643
D’Artagnan took possession of his command. Porthos left the service,	250.15041636372314
and in the course of the following year married Mme. Coquenard; the	309.36846789097694
coffer so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.	282.7662945318658
Mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of	167.2964371651138
which he had been ambitious all his life—that of standing behind a	289.86394712028107
gilded carriage.	184.96165631083178
Aramis, after a journey into Lorraine, disappeared all at once, and	301.6805746838808
ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through	177.91984268314212
Mme. de Chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,	329.78705924226404
yielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent—only into	239.0022756870829
which, nobody knew.	218.59298344243442
Bazin became a lay brother.	337.74577991010943
Athos remained a Musketeer under the command of D’Artagnan till the	191.65604312803194
year 1633, at which period, after a journey he made to Touraine, he	356.47189961187473
also quit the service, under the pretext of having inherited a small	284.887126371763
property in Roussillon.	232.73308841620891
Grimaud followed Athos.	283.3628110250154
D’Artagnan fought three times with Rochefort, and wounded him three	285.67688979640377
times.	340.862659106978
“I shall probably kill you the fourth,” said he to him, holding out his	346.53739377389513
hand to assist him to rise.	332.56855941292883
“It is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are,”	281.43130893227504
answered the wounded man. “_Corbleu!_ I am more your friend than you	207.71481985300608
think—for after our very first encounter, I could by saying a word to	315.86889515077064
the cardinal have had your throat cut!”	351.3481916294256
They this time embraced heartily, and without retaining any malice.	355.7974527288267
Planchet obtained from Rochefort the rank of sergeant in the Piedmont	356.7431529096976
regiment.	284.2295167313179
M. Bonacieux lived on very quietly, wholly ignorant of what had become	268.8892817846095
of his wife, and caring very little about it. One day he had the	208.0926692392019
imprudence to recall himself to the memory of the cardinal. The	243.7013009890233
cardinal had him informed that he would provide for him so that he	189.97774456250465
should never want for anything in future. In fact, M. Bonacieux, having	173.83916290519346
left his house at seven o’clock in the evening to go to the Louvre,	179.1883647517558
never appeared again in the Rue des Fossoyeurs; the opinion of those	255.32665137644102
who seemed to be best informed was that he was fed and lodged in some	186.7569216153058
royal castle, at the expense of his generous Eminence.	190.18062031903025

public support and donations to carry out its mission of	364.63930729481723

freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest	226.3966242007386
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations	358.82593825585036

status with the IRS.	331.4700692964425
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating	320.3718868942208
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United	289.69335108332945
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a	286.35523171690687
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	298.1848258664584
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations	334.595959941157
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND	278.6467140293553

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition	220.84039682209328
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who	229.7335294401896
approach us with offers to donate.	185.93409023622903
