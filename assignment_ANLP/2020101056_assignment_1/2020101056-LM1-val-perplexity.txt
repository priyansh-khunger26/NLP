“Adieu till then.”	178.7510861299023
Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of Monte Cristo, whose	337.3474382650328
lips turned pale, but who preserved his ceremonious smile, Andrea	179.7092382129864
seized the count’s hand, pressed it, jumped into his phaeton, and	210.17020554236
disappeared.	239.17436950190557
The four or five remaining hours before nine o’clock arrived, Andrea	217.22530613828133
employed in riding, paying visits,—designed to induce those of whom he	213.68344338098487
had spoken to appear at the banker’s in their gayest	351.82427558166444
equipages,—dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have	360.1557013968281
since turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the	229.07362179819677
initiative.	176.98305286595146
In fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon, the gallery	186.50967229187276
adjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same floor, were	245.5811600466419
filled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little in the event,	326.78654875683816
but who all participated in that love of being present wherever there	352.23391213461565
is anything fresh to be seen. An Academician would say that the	364.496275754506
entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers	358.83428637173273
which attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing	308.2973166104519
drones.	294.6688619608568
50025m	238.6182797774741
No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light	179.93041039060853
streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the	210.33855741167747
bad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of,	297.75860704016236
shone in its splendor. Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant	263.5434868426931
simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half	301.37770342523027
concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by	312.62347061114826
a single jewel. Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence	347.15839116592207
which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire.	266.79357095027626
Madame Danglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray,	297.61577928651
Beauchamp, and Château-Renaud. Debray was admitted to the house for	366.46058245445573
this grand ceremony, but on the same plane with everyone else, and	227.24243523350484
without any particular privilege. M. Danglars, surrounded by deputies	276.73739376781214
and men connected with the revenue, was explaining a new theory of	322.8381342591079
taxation which he intended to adopt when the course of events had	322.6519282408685
compelled the government to call him into the ministry. Andrea, on	351.9023299858077
whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies of the Opera, was	335.4512125701383
explaining to him rather cleverly, since he was obliged to be bold to	242.5855487539023
appear at ease, his future projects, and the new luxuries he meant to	205.341242818461
introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy-five	220.92348570927587
thousand livres per annum.	286.56203603069207
The crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of	326.22540331188395
turquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds. As usual, the oldest	266.8201384725104
women were the most decorated, and the ugliest the most conspicuous. If	295.9744277777646
there was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it,	256.21772922796805
concealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with	300.5932954388405
a bird-of-paradise.	316.71468896308664
At each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the	295.24584939530166
laughter, the door-keeper’s voice was heard announcing some name well	207.04081444034009
known in the financial department, respected in the army, or	348.7409992776993
illustrious in the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a	235.25907703740916
slight movement in the different groups. But for one whose privilege it	220.40164810078412
was to agitate that ocean of human waves, how many were received with a	326.1011156203487
look of indifference or a sneer of disdain!	328.52037673507385
At the moment when the hand of the massive time-piece, representing	266.6760990938874
Endymion asleep, pointed to nine on its golden face, and the hammer,	247.18633413650142
the faithful type of mechanical thought, struck nine times, the name of	293.4164762555704
the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in its turn, and as if by an	303.1544955141048
electric shock all the assembly turned towards the door. The count was	276.48915507792833
dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his white waistcoat	228.87562213935195
displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly	243.18882311520582
noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his	232.47986947568745
face. His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the slender gold	295.66199478300746
thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat.	283.6186063241007
A circle was immediately formed around the door. The count perceived at	324.2479712206921
one glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars	348.64411085780165
at the other, and Eugénie in front of him. He first advanced towards	227.13346659988395
the baroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come	217.66309584300018
alone, Valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so	173.0082410303791
clear was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to	229.18773279576038
Eugénie, whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that	255.121544314503
the proud artist was quite struck. Near her was Mademoiselle Louise	263.2755392814613
d’Armilly, who thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had	196.04365669482033
so kindly given her for Italy, which she intended immediately to make	304.25455342356156
use of. On leaving these ladies he found himself with Danglars, who had	233.76121281041398
advanced to meet him.	294.72606500081145
Having accomplished these three social duties, Monte Cristo stopped,	177.61934559383633
looking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class,	240.58915286285645
which seems to say, “I have done my duty, now let others do theirs.”	355.37896826061103
Andrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation	190.02519683083258
caused by the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his	259.7686816176882
respects to the count. He found him completely surrounded; all were	257.3887567516807
eager to speak to him, as is always the case with those whose words are	339.11052914296886
few and weighty. The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged	220.31368999145087
their scrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which	212.04707539308083
covered the table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table	259.82813678592885
supported on lions’ claws. One of the notaries sat down, the other	234.5521414174039
remained standing. They were about to proceed to the reading of the	190.45266010969416
contract, which half Paris assembled was to sign. All took their	195.34842389602795
places, or rather the ladies formed a circle, while the gentlemen (more	248.90771675412714
indifferent to the restraints of what Boileau calls the _style	348.8357164815048
énergique_) commented on the feverish agitation of Andrea, on M.	229.36472010598362
Danglars’ riveted attention, Eugénie’s composure, and the light and	359.46281699024337
sprightly manner in which the baroness treated this important affair.	265.2435414086135
The contract was read during a profound silence. But as soon as it was	178.1676113066724
finished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the	231.8848161050728
brilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command of	342.75182077994316
the two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding	176.04862996609543
presents and the young lady’s diamonds, which had been made in a room	258.82675080908496
entirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their	264.29987783384684
delusions over the envious assembly.	215.6833689993555
Mademoiselle Danglars’ charms were heightened in the opinion of the	253.25571365874825
young men, and for the moment seemed to outvie the sun in splendor. As	256.5572960732743
for the ladies, it is needless to say that while they coveted the	237.7287389156403
millions, they thought they did not need them for themselves, as they	227.02773323633426
were beautiful enough without them. Andrea, surrounded by his friends,	247.1528723533649
complimented, flattered, beginning to believe in the reality of his	218.974407159904
dream, was almost bewildered. The notary solemnly took the pen,	188.52012527882442
flourished it above his head, and said:	279.4140347779308
“Gentlemen, we are about to sign the contract.”	220.0606986385729
The baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti,	301.8293921342772
senior, then the baroness, afterwards the “future couple,” as they are	220.92254924754997
styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents.	179.85852324129146
The baron took the pen and signed, then the representative. The	328.3500173039952
baroness approached, leaning on Madame de Villefort’s arm.	251.47763423739605
“My dear,” said she, as she took the pen, “is it not vexatious? An	222.40150987780922
unexpected incident, in the affair of murder and theft at the Count of	348.23930589599524
Monte Cristo’s, in which he nearly fell a victim, deprives us of the	270.1224481198019
pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort.”	243.7924904440972
“Indeed?” said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have	291.398485834705
said, “Oh, well, what do I care?”	185.13996552933784
“As a matter of fact,” said Monte Cristo, approaching, “I am much	312.613763880078
afraid that I am the involuntary cause of his absence.”	233.1747567355313
“What, you, count?” said Madame Danglars, signing; “if you are, take	225.43242137389444
care, for I shall never forgive you.”	283.8570155420109
Andrea pricked up his ears.	358.23255273961644
“But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.”	281.76850796148386
Everyone listened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips,	319.74067321365715
was about to speak.	254.3659328889745
“You remember,” said the count, during the most profound silence, “that	244.4663785904561
the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house; the supposition	365.87814825014755
is that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting to leave it.”	233.99258199029148
“Yes,” said Danglars.	359.4715976896821
“In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his	251.1987350206166
clothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up,	204.99124362149627
with the exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked.”	345.3656829386869
Andrea turned pale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in	328.6672831558848
the horizon, which appeared to forebode a coming storm.	237.7439306018797
“Well, this waistcoat was discovered today, covered with blood, and	255.0541313501448
with a hole over the heart.” The ladies screamed, and two or three	281.88055785121105
prepared to faint. “It was brought to me. No one could guess what the	176.48801551967324
dirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the	246.4630849849161
murdered man. My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper	245.0864419258349
in the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you,	285.1387014425974
baron.”	336.7097549614741
“To me?” cried Danglars.	233.15364804987232
“Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the	317.79058235580806
blood with which the letter was stained,” replied Monte Cristo, amid	211.57978890627945
the general outburst of amazement.	359.4943919428621
“But,” asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness,	244.27221810035138
“how could that prevent M. de Villefort——”	231.02272528860823
“In this simple way, madame,” replied Monte Cristo; “the waistcoat and	294.00094589818093
the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I	225.27402711026787
therefore sent them to the king’s attorney. You understand, my dear	228.38127282277588
baron, that legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was,	205.35952371450142
perhaps, some plot against you.” Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo	191.83225872329547
and disappeared in the second drawing-room.	348.7414502596307
“Possibly,” said Danglars; “was not this murdered man an old	210.87814653307908
galley-slave?”	174.2317063120305
50025m	368.1234122963556
“Yes,” replied the count; “a felon named Caderousse.” Danglars turned	301.25967418144216
slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little	250.2942723826426
drawing-room.	299.1143702363506
“But go on signing,” said Monte Cristo; “I perceive that my story has	187.06315287882882
caused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and	237.6138668888794
to Mademoiselle Danglars.”	303.21989465407677
The baroness, who had signed, returned the pen to the notary.	304.6530525258816
“Prince Cavalcanti,” said the latter; “Prince Cavalcanti, where are	356.5014297032002
you?”	343.96360714792803
“Andrea, Andrea,” repeated several young people, who were already on	362.77298778654153
sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.	328.7066841507106
“Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign,” cried	200.28431583364375
Danglars to one of the floorkeepers.	199.45739140414915
But at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the	237.69983903557312
principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the	325.0511918546398
apartments, _quærens quem devoret_. There was, indeed, reason to	344.0385954448617
retreat, to be alarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two	246.29905031761996
soldiers at the door of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards	289.35621804278236
Danglars, preceded by a commissary of police, girded with his scarf.	310.4903009633306
Madame Danglars uttered a scream and fainted. Danglars, who thought	364.81283947919934
himself threatened (certain consciences are never calm),—Danglars even	282.715756486368
before his guests showed a countenance of abject terror.	270.7364610813985
“What is the matter, sir?” asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the	271.33676278551195
commissioner.	175.26201408698512
“Which of you gentlemen,” asked the magistrate, without replying to the	199.36046504582515
count, “answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?”	233.17310575045562
A cry of astonishment was heard from all parts of the room. They	173.45430396912255
searched; they questioned.	264.4199191465819
“But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti?” asked Danglars in amazement.	356.5521901388893
“A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon.”	191.71823225556173
“And what crime has he committed?”	260.51286740118695
“He is accused,” said the commissary with his inflexible voice, “of	186.0769712683151
having assassinated the man named Caderousse, his former companion in	319.62119434881356
prison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the	212.31050349467856
Count of Monte Cristo.”	260.95314676508497
Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him. Andrea was gone.	280.46304945275403
 Chapter 97. The Departure for Belgium	251.4703102017039
A few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M.	319.3194891099275
Danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and	344.8383172966651
by the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as	367.9891032671071
much rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken	195.70344849108724
out among the guests.	331.213805893619
In a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the staircases, by	320.86321549725756
every exit, everyone hastened to retire, or rather to fly; for it was a	262.4688498218969
situation where the ordinary condolences,—which even the best friends	280.77948462962195
are so eager to offer in great catastrophes,—were seen to be utterly	201.27082008238426
futile. There remained in the banker’s house only Danglars, closeted in	189.01434275858372
his study, and making his statement to the officer of gendarmes; Madame	248.1705539608413
Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we are acquainted; and	368.66816267028645
Eugénie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had retired to her	278.69785407957386
room with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.	314.30002823588086
As for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than usual,	265.50684961040804
for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Café de	311.65725480631903
Paris), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the	269.1621089774689
insult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups in	245.93360563381196
the hall, in the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of	210.89779183285592
their duty, which was thus naturally interrupted. Of all this	296.9858228335306
household, only two persons deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle	327.71350694655706
Eugénie Danglars and Mademoiselle Louise d’Armilly.	300.99252532801455
The betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful	312.2459751969847
lip, and the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion,	351.5613184348033
who was paler and more disturbed than herself. On reaching her room	334.13929192718706
Eugénie locked her door, while Louise fell on a chair.	277.9150129134005
“Ah, what a dreadful thing,” said the young musician; “who would have	290.1093087756369
suspected it? M. Andrea Cavalcanti a murderer—a galley-slave escaped—a	339.98994684434683
convict!”	331.79141626930397
An ironical smile curled the lip of Eugénie. “In truth, I was fated,”	332.0308167024808
said she. “I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti.”	346.16206050186213
“Oh, do not confound the two, Eugénie.”	245.97828661899217
“Hold your tongue! The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be able	256.0420048964312
now to do more than detest them—I despise them.”	304.6927219713775
“What shall we do?” asked Louise.	179.88974009826106
“What shall we do?”	270.24133777130913
“Yes.”	236.13371620923778
“Why, the same we had intended doing three days since—set off.”	173.274714886566
“What?—although you are not now going to be married, you intend	242.27978089311722
still——”	260.0339368959477
“Listen, Louise. I hate this life of the fashionable world, always	309.5589730853716
ordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper. What I have always	247.01194953480768
wished for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and	255.71835336416962
independent, relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to	234.18903661719418
myself. Remain here? What for?—that they may try, a month hence, to	186.71339043647419
marry me again; and to whom?—M. Debray, perhaps, as it was once	296.26618257792984
proposed. No, Louise, no! This evening’s adventure will serve for my	324.1374822931208
excuse. I did not seek one, I did not ask for one. God sends me this,	317.9614101918541
and I hail it joyfully!”	177.17309461680858
“How strong and courageous you are!” said the fair, frail girl to her	328.93861005676854
brunette companion.	208.45903346921557
“Did you not yet know me? Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs. The	241.65798152969793
post-chaise——”	192.09922603380156
“Was happily bought three days since.”	320.038276784932
“Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?”	364.68676578330167
“Yes.”	187.26388098062256
“Our passport?”	233.07979351011653
“Here it is.”	355.6546880739472
And Eugénie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and	368.82752307888927
read:	198.2878020362888
“M. Léon d’Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist; hair	362.7183663325869
black, eyes black; travelling with his sister.”	219.43780114205248
“Capital! How did you get this passport?”	239.2395727322885
“When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of	261.5567963486182
the theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as	361.07605104057626
a woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me	271.94941357477325
a man’s passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have	278.83933122309105
added with my own hand, ‘travelling with his sister.’”	208.99900805104727
50035m	204.00080658429223
“Well,” said Eugénie cheerfully, “we have then only to pack up our	292.5310377703873
trunks; we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract,	321.1379860222895
instead of the evening of the wedding—that is all.”	221.45362694883065
“But consider the matter seriously, Eugénie!”	188.9130037415919
“Oh, I am done with considering! I am tired of hearing only of market	248.88758516450332
reports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish	172.7252173848022
funds, of Haitian bonds. Instead of that, Louise—do you	328.90761137481803
understand?—air, liberty, melody of birds, plains of Lombardy, Venetian	193.6974206155029
canals, Roman palaces, the Bay of Naples. How much have we, Louise?”	274.5771805981539
The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid	257.43521611988893
secretaire a small portfolio with a lock, in which she counted	339.40738100063135
twenty-three bank-notes.	345.9046999047282
“Twenty-three thousand francs,” said she.	257.25123721443083
“And as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels,” said Eugénie.	291.7409246918691
“We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs we can live like	261.2124991086003
princesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six	221.31271949696497
months—you with your music, and I with my voice—we shall double our	185.8517987075828
capital. Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the jewel-box;	329.33874039792136
so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other	194.00887533642913
would still have hers left. Now, the portmanteau—let us make haste—the	298.34420184364166
portmanteau!”	229.42922165133254
“Stop!” said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars’ door.	172.21082534204703
“What do you fear?”	215.7858082099909
“That we may be discovered.”	290.6663927667682
“The door is locked.”	311.8962974181594
“They may tell us to open it.”	255.86865878682374
“They may if they like, but we will not.”	188.65811853781224
“You are a perfect Amazon, Eugénie!” And the two young girls began to	312.2402810777701
heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.	255.55058042337703
“There now,” said Eugénie, “while I change my costume do you lock the	327.7752250868457
portmanteau.” Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands	346.65730539998555
on the top of the portmanteau.	230.50759744800982
“But I cannot,” said she; “I am not strong enough; do you shut it.”	331.8802711301503
“Ah, you do well to ask,” said Eugénie, laughing; “I forgot that I was	344.95721816716207
Hercules, and you only the pale Omphale!”	338.1256577650612
And the young girl, kneeling on the top, pressed the two parts of the	357.7661654109339
portmanteau together, and Mademoiselle d’Armilly passed the bolt of the	237.64212070625726
padlock through. When this was done, Eugénie opened a drawer, of which	362.8179415571137
she kept the key, and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling	318.5957186208679
cloak.	225.0210761354811
“Here,” said she, “you see I have thought of everything; with this	202.66283845341823
cloak you will not be cold.”	353.67842612593506
“But you?”	303.0248180071324
“Oh, I am never cold, you know! Besides, with these men’s clothes——”	318.86641625463125
“Will you dress here?”	215.98366676629095
“Certainly.”	275.31023666093483
“Shall you have time?”	296.811646552651
“Do not be uneasy, you little coward! All our servants are busy,	181.31164961250585
discussing the grand affair. Besides, what is there astonishing, when	184.0290474506278
you think of the grief I ought to be in, that I shut myself up?—tell	190.01296411576138
me!”	246.14807729306585
“No, truly—you comfort me.”	370.10485405626594
“Come and help me.”	252.58798679553576
From the same drawer she took a man’s complete costume, from the boots	259.27283146649626
to the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing	361.8654644316499
superfluous, but every requisite. Then, with a promptitude which	364.059944083261
indicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by	282.8540887759457
adopting the garb of the opposite sex, Eugénie drew on the boots and	261.7128174343785
pantaloons, tied her cravat, buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat,	210.35447491708806
and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure.	210.0793444917751
“Oh, that is very good—indeed, it is very good!” said Louise, looking	312.78323959087913
at her with admiration; “but that beautiful black hair, those	224.2902196116311
magnificent braids, which made all the ladies sigh with envy,—will they	322.21034334559243
go under a man’s hat like the one I see down there?”	241.50814114720868
“You shall see,” said Eugénie. And with her left hand seizing the thick	328.68609976217397
mass, which her long fingers could scarcely grasp, she took in her	306.2497775216042
right hand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel met through the	249.61588417782116
rich and splendid hair, which fell in a cluster at her feet as she	329.5977104187167
leaned back to keep it from her coat. Then she grasped the front hair,	252.15618125119443
which she also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the	215.82833767631794
contrary, her eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her	365.3263368721524
ebony eyebrows.	296.52768993671015
50039m	172.584220383033
“Oh, the magnificent hair!” said Louise, with regret.	273.47860951796554
“And am I not a hundred times better thus?” cried Eugénie, smoothing	298.3871367585999
the scattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine	275.8993960151503
appearance; “and do you not think me handsomer so?”	257.7418103530612
“Oh, you are beautiful—always beautiful!” cried Louise. “Now, where are	269.8577758950987
you going?”	247.80415222143216
“To Brussels, if you like; it is the nearest frontier. We can go to	309.61584987770857
Brussels, Liège, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasbourg. We	286.6318798278123
will cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard.	257.36735788057405
Will that do?”	328.7000196790998
“Yes.”	301.7545367051686
“What are you looking at?”	321.24991644176146
“I am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! One would say	242.74144129691734
you were carrying me off.”	325.19590244696235
“And they would be right, _pardieu!_”	297.91085995753457
“Oh, I think you swore, Eugénie.”	362.8591992902194
And the two young girls, whom everyone might have thought plunged in	282.5109307677383
grief, the one on her own account, the other from interest in her	258.40537925968374
friend, burst out laughing, as they cleared away every visible trace of	355.86492684640723
the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their	189.69983999632353
escape. Then, having blown out the lights, the two fugitives, looking	289.2762016806725
and listening eagerly, with outstretched necks, opened the door of a	236.17640248924064
dressing-room which led by a side staircase down to the yard,—Eugénie	172.79578239583566
going first, and holding with one arm the portmanteau, which by the	203.69295239227483
opposite handle Mademoiselle d’Armilly scarcely raised with both hands.	239.1415229364001
The yard was empty; the clock was striking twelve. The porter was not	263.3147371491194
yet gone to bed. Eugénie approached softly, and saw the old man	333.62178087870575
sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge. She returned to Louise,	222.59246682726632
took up the portmanteau, which she had placed for a moment on the	294.0623880431176
ground, and they reached the archway under the shadow of the wall.	185.45618361478606
Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway, so that if the	200.20128006588175
porter chanced to awake he might see but one person. Then placing	185.707426493726
herself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard:	192.11936942295702
“Gate!” cried she, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping at the	309.1051582375359
window.	283.0393227413289
The porter got up as Eugénie expected, and even advanced some steps to	303.1510725593729
recognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking	268.1016601748224
his boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.	178.80399911068335
Louise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded	264.1318765186216
lightly forward. Eugénie, apparently calm, although in all probability	213.138962722397
her heart beat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn.	195.83056018217778
A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two	369.60074092694686
young girls, having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire,	277.7104065931932
walked behind this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for	343.0388049433244
Eugénie, she was as strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at	284.96929525598995
the appointed spot. Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the	181.60238350562065
portmanteau, gave him some pieces of money, and having rapped at the	238.0161098800499
shutter sent him away. The shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of	350.9573046522637
a little laundress, who had been previously warned, and was not yet	330.63566643660295
gone to bed. She opened the door.	340.0034460742879
“Mademoiselle,” said Eugénie, “let the porter get the post-chaise from	222.1340308788379
the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel. Here are	331.0304478009202
five francs for his trouble.”	262.8947611434535
“Indeed,” said Louise, “I admire you, and I could almost say respect	197.6036353282074
you.” The laundress looked on in astonishment, but as she had been	369.2076550052668
promised twenty louis, she made no remark.	184.64000905472705
In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses,	220.76457425270291
which were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the	257.6114317841232
porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and	217.31427899139476
strap.	255.28028694733536
“Here is the passport,” said the postilion, “which way are we going,	184.15889676525092
young gentleman?”	187.21813460027548
“To Fontainebleau,” replied Eugénie with an almost masculine voice.	292.90069883330614
“What do you say?” said Louise.	368.58366942429177
“I am giving them the slip,” said Eugénie; “this woman to whom we have	216.29871001711246
given twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our	310.5771443004701
direction.”	254.1474424009516
And the young girl jumped into the britzka, which was admirably	173.7164542014003
arranged for sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.	219.82220489342842
“You are always right,” said the music teacher, seating herself by the	273.18830855490563
side of her friend.	336.52577680135033
A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion, having been put in the	275.222541259222
right road, passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the	354.6677735461741
Barrière Saint-Martin.	282.3955182516277
“Ah,” said Louise, breathing freely, “here we are out of Paris.”	291.8026633887673
“Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact,” replied Eugénie.	237.09528515907311
“Yes, and without violence,” said Louise.	235.90801780324307
“I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance,” replied	362.1501686388267
Eugénie.	186.2828759391132
These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling	179.26122632789858
over the pavement of La Villette. M. Danglars no longer had a daughter.	315.20789392761117
 Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern	365.0742960894607
And now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing	312.3225752294152
their way to Brussels, and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so	370.1684028123012
inopportunely interrupted in his rise to fortune. Notwithstanding his	174.08546983498422
youth, Master Andrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy. We have	269.3609297529152
seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually	295.4048444502502
approached the door, and crossing two or three rooms at last	239.61621533523584
disappeared. But we have forgotten to mention one circumstance, which	270.99433072347784
nevertheless ought not to be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed,	331.4073261375322
the _trousseau_ of the bride-elect was on exhibition. There were	211.49582701223946
caskets of diamonds, cashmere shawls, Valenciennes lace, English veils,	218.14565351987034
and in fact all the tempting things, the bare mention of which makes	239.0302778497056
the hearts of young girls bound with joy, and which is called the	261.4676667754278
_corbeille_.22 Now, in passing through this room, Andrea proved himself	208.70760689954193
not only to be clever and intelligent, but also provident, for he	324.73599406740465
helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him.	337.4672693925231
Furnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from	233.02214249265768
the window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes. Tall	305.24806329842204
and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a	243.91954284210962
Spartan, he walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to	341.33816176025846
direct his steps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the	192.65479648774715
spot where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken. Having	290.75451575954276
passed through the Rue du Mont-Blanc, guided by the instinct which	304.7173816498827
leads thieves always to take the safest path, he found himself at the	260.58688426614174
end of the Rue La Fayette. There he stopped, breathless and panting. He	369.48277438266985
was quite alone; on one side was the vast wilderness of the	221.94821639962024
Saint-Lazare, on the other, Paris enshrouded in darkness.	289.3406862057699
“Am I to be captured?” he cried; “no, not if I can use more activity	207.3773509661021
than my enemies. My safety is now a mere question of speed.”	255.6906247900618
At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnière.	192.9635103438175
The dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits	211.0653583453635
of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his	288.6489962799985
station.	368.1464984834032
“Ho, friend!” said Benedetto.	219.81759810071475
“What do you want, sir?” asked the driver.	320.2560564936356
“Is your horse tired?”	321.7595777239821
“Tired? oh, yes, tired enough—he has done nothing the whole of this	258.1113920519693
blessed day! Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all	347.64614613684444
seven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to	175.9794703673501
the owner.”	305.2712553653017
“Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?”	334.10739414329896
“With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. Tell me what	279.1520053787937
I am to do for this.”	214.31039581768363
“A very easy thing, if your horse isn’t tired.”	178.0080232347997
“I tell you he’ll go like the wind,—only tell me which way to drive.”	234.3721611207038
“Towards the Louvres.”	284.75630049767494
“Ah, I know the way—you get good sweetened rum over there.”	237.96161106367492
“Exactly so; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom I	296.3383967477491
am going to hunt tomorrow at Chapelle-en-Serval. He should have waited	173.6200472760184
for me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and,	364.5668756228424
tired of waiting, he must have gone on.”	256.9486728838979
“It is likely.”	228.20653765024622
“Well, will you try and overtake him?”	201.9471616403199
“Nothing I should like better.”	323.799249004413
“If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have	191.0107850731965
twenty francs; if not before Louvres, thirty.”	201.53780646868051
“And if we do overtake him?”	190.02773085558465
“Forty,” said Andrea, after a moment’s hesitation, at the end of which	268.69911991294885
he remembered that he might safely promise.	194.65076938684302
“That’s all right,” said the man; “hop in, and we’re off! Who-o-o-pla!”	217.86317323442086
Andrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the Faubourg	235.39076609048257
Saint-Denis, along the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and	302.5133270008798
threaded its way through the interminable Villette. They never overtook	216.2779626629522
the chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot	191.14037414658281
whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green	199.92990184707114
cabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be	213.81759185084127
seen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are	234.0124521675128
green, the inquiries increased at every step. Everyone had just seen it	255.5067554516979
pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in	192.5230812766985
advance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend. Once the	324.4443716197959
cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two	286.51329428645226
post-horses.	331.1542051466176
“Ah,” said Cavalcanti to himself, “if I only had that britzka, those	279.05424755926185
two good post-horses, and above all the passport that carries them on!”	354.1133383803441
And he sighed deeply.	189.44752949399162
The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d’Armilly.	290.6704621834967
“Hurry, hurry!” said Andrea, “we must overtake him soon.”	321.6828064838529
And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since	305.34041755739815
leaving the barrier, and arrived steaming at Louvres.	259.7807039233278
“Certainly,” said Andrea, “I shall not overtake my friend, but I shall	216.37882986693097
kill your horse, therefore I had better stop. Here are thirty francs; I	336.8120465977331
will sleep at the _Cheval Rouge_, and will secure a place in the first	285.21170419858794
coach. Good-night, friend.”	350.9523806616951
And Andrea, after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man’s	357.61692969014643
hand, leaped lightly on to the pathway. The cabman joyfully pocketed	283.9036723299765
the sum, and turned back on his road to Paris. Andrea pretended to go	230.52307125922616
towards the hotel of the _Cheval Rouge_, but after leaning an instant	171.16662702884466
against the door, and hearing the last sound of the cab, which was	238.59477520571684
disappearing from view, he went on his road, and with a lusty stride	226.35621801482637
soon traversed the space of two leagues. Then he rested; he must be	239.41650799342005
near Chapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going.	248.60876792274115
It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form	294.984765464858
some resolution, adopt some plan. It would be impossible to make use of	348.2132914684752
a diligence, equally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a	243.34709588358504
passport was necessary. It was still more impossible to remain in the	232.80022751643844
department of the Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in	330.97491958841647
France; this was quite out of the question, especially to a man like	255.87878682259876
Andrea, perfectly conversant with criminal matters.	245.81195919873272
He sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and	289.0877234972503
reflected. Ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was	192.378621354821
made. He threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to	369.81441678669455
unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball costume, and going	272.30302615005706
to Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in	173.32879500036216
the place.	347.62039514809237
The host opened.	300.6497050805109
“My friend,” said Andrea, “I was coming from Mortefontaine to Senlis,	334.40030984746926
when my horse, which is a troublesome creature, stumbled and threw me.	281.0114218611933
I must reach Compiègne tonight, or I shall cause deep anxiety to my	185.70360898114103
family. Could you let me hire a horse of you?”	361.51492570600374
An innkeeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad. The	312.24949091649614
host called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle _Le Blanc_ then	191.84582193889426
he awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride	242.18773011439376
before the gentleman and bring back the horse. Andrea gave the	207.82272565670192
innkeeper twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a	198.5068706425184
visiting card. This belonged to one of his friends at the Café de	319.33382597853614
Paris, so that the innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was	308.2025199494826
convinced that he had let his horse to the Count of Mauléon, 25 Rue	174.4248849969832
Saint-Dominique, that being the name and address on the card.	298.20281347314403
_Le Blanc_ was not a fast animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace;	190.48118761816653
in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which	254.38664488410905
separated him from Compiègne, and four o’clock struck as he reached the	246.10577185164007
place where the coaches stop. There is an excellent tavern at	329.32089576139117
Compiègne, well remembered by those who have ever been there. Andrea,	307.2068285085911
who had often stayed there in his rides about Paris, recollected the	272.82875768429534
Bell and Bottle inn; he turned around, saw the sign by the light of a	214.72884773771807
reflected lamp, and having dismissed the child, giving him all the	333.02077611521963
small coin he had about him, he began knocking at the door, very	210.51307170802687
reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours before him he	326.1005142593316
had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a sound	335.84882232753534
sleep and a good supper. A waiter opened the door.	217.07360463257334
“My friend,” said Andrea, “I have been dining at Saint-Jean-aux-Bois,	328.21720978860014
and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a	199.68695952039627
fool I have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours	344.0277449334067
in the forest. Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which	263.91472135237257
overlook the court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux.”	225.67738590397875
The waiter had no suspicions; Andrea spoke with perfect composure, he	207.0212849615447
had a cigar in his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat;	263.79423264317927
his clothes were fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots	238.6719081356954
irreproachable; he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late,	217.98424576365122
that was all. While the waiter was preparing his room, the hostess	353.6097695722406
arose; Andrea assumed his most charming smile, and asked if he could	303.52057698036
have No. 3, which he had occupied on his last stay at Compiègne.	268.1351197900415
Unfortunately, No. 3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with	261.407482386189
his sister. Andrea appeared in despair, but consoled himself when the	277.7305907461109
hostess assured him that No. 7, prepared for him, was situated	290.92170607240337
precisely the same as No. 3, and while warming his feet and chatting	218.47874367729418
about the last races at Chantilly, he waited until they announced his	200.0223550803071
room to be ready.	189.92383516408577
Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out	349.8328236147969
upon the court of the Bell Hotel, which with its triple galleries like	294.311507452477
those of a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the	306.88658180654755
light columns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you	254.7747110681756
can imagine. The fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and	301.04635841009895
sparkling, and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good	365.5515840789388
an appetite as though nothing had happened. Then he went to bed and	280.1678438376315
almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men	279.6740941968004
of twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse. Now, here	196.16880897432523
we are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that	227.22538988808813
he did not.	195.79547720752834
This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance	188.53177060855575
of his security. Before daybreak he would awake, leave the inn after	325.5167156072413
rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would, under	361.14996162269745
pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of some	222.93675830550546
peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet,	330.99829463593926
casting off the lion’s skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with	221.0787482007104
his hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden	181.08887880393166
comb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his	235.9624773591555
old comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the	266.65563512312946
wooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and	348.72964173652235
sleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering	286.6540078630363
inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.	365.3251016395182
Once past the frontier, Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds;	361.591227812031
and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about	200.00813662972695
with him in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of	204.52738720801943
about 50,000 livres, which he philosophically considered as no very	324.2699842499899
deplorable condition after all. Moreover, he reckoned much on the	259.14860764052514
interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own	176.6742290520758
misadventures. These were the reasons which, added to the fatigue,	333.99386331720507
caused Andrea to sleep so soundly. In order that he might wake early he	355.145813443717
did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the door	366.0627184934597
and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose	171.57980960025574
temper he well knew, and which was never absent from him.	195.28603487397805
About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight,	257.87751314790546
which played, warm and brilliant, upon his face. In all well-organized	286.9904078926488
brains, the predominating idea—and there always is one—is sure to be	302.835274191954
the last thought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the	261.5781664018758
morning. Andrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating	361.63507858761557
idea presented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too	277.22605797706404
long. He jumped out of bed and ran to the window. A gendarme was	229.263195860122
crossing the court. A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in	266.76694265083216
the world, even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a	210.48339217925798
timid conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white	343.019845382597
uniform is really very alarming.	173.46880810651427
“Why is that gendarme there?” asked Andrea of himself.	236.86412765611055
Then, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has,	177.61976217565027
doubtless, remarked in him, “There is nothing astonishing in seeing a	269.05594983882963
gendarme at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.”	279.6347861414703
And the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had	217.5134534753071
failed to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had	178.5213350857208
led in Paris.	299.06325680699865
“Now then,” said Andrea, while dressing himself, “I’ll wait till he	277.2441503079196
leaves, and then I’ll slip away.”	319.2696265730648
50047m	262.42724528432854
And, saying this, Andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat,	303.5821260462959
stole gently to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin	359.47142110716953
curtain. Not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man	337.66626976606597
now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of	277.65109580723316
the staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third,	219.16822366470478
on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at	184.3532157144636
the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress. The	176.5909888201649
appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of	199.8799107528717
curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the	350.6719323073754
entrance to the hotel.	230.4283799857455
“They’re after me!” was Andrea’s first thought. “_Diable!_”	243.49071225552098
A pallor overspread the young man’s forehead, and he looked around him	232.1874638191711
with anxiety. His room, like all those on the same floor, had but one	363.61651748178826
outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody. “I am lost!” was his	310.9179830436347
second thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea’s situation, an arrest	235.09301860969154
meant the assizes, trial, and death,—death without mercy or delay.	217.12810808072882
For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands, and	209.74539800030465
during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon a	173.48057762643683
ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his	323.28155648452366
mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks.	305.22044183460474
He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the	289.28017670780355
chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper. With forced composure	366.492128637703
he dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a	207.23136073321325
sheet of paper:	294.0662610551367
“I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave	176.41469298231257
behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount. I shall be	318.60614904581985
excused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.”	180.56786301885734
He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper. This	206.7374513947172
done, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and	343.2197057400325
even placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting	303.73125145438826
to close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to	205.93145950581282
that kind of gymnastic exercise, after replacing the chimney-board,	335.74761194666723
which represented Achilles with Deidamia, and effacing the very marks	204.45629719994415
of his feet upon the ashes, he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel,	226.66402865085328
which afforded him the only means of escape left.	350.52899172307946
At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked	206.12851373360468
upstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the	176.76395427008242
second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by	332.789490204171
the one stationed at the door.	302.55079246146875
Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. At	285.26256947735055
daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost	175.54230082718058
immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost	272.98102053278035
endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse. Compiègne, that royal	368.00148275087565
residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,	173.39840007859428
gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations	291.0246645946083
as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle	319.6830647534198
being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed	261.4319802221217
their first inquiries there.	210.28597745843143
Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville,	209.80247584472153
which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others	297.9921017096478
that a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel	365.07791344912107
who was relieved at six o’clock in the morning, remembered perfectly	301.3503998314111
that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young	264.42441990869537
man arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man,	239.58012634832338
having dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel,	172.82959775573747
which was opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late	194.2121057912222
arrival had attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other	340.7874548562711
than Andrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed	347.62702030688814
their steps towards his room. They found the door ajar.	329.11576014492107
“Oh, oh,” said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick; “a	198.33610377271918
bad sign to find the door open! I would rather find it triply bolted.”	345.16372626913693
And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or	345.33802485470903
rather corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled. We say	284.73369888407206
corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced	184.99085497015506
by a single proof. He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook the	227.80204074875726
curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.	289.29431902973363
Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the	209.98650788376167
ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be	213.27180214605875
passed over without serious investigation.	321.1629236211411
The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the	189.99246943480213
chimney with them, set a light to it. The fire crackled, and the smoke	207.59320983750575
ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell	173.89682354108868
down, as they expected. The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society	287.5342443795735
ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he	185.89680437028866
were advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the	267.52788361414616
fire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the	367.6544311265079
chimney-pots.	223.90713539233676
50049m	306.3696675136255
At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim	299.6853469082495
in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, “He is not here!” But venturing	199.99521786615466
to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as might	229.822608667353
have been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching	240.78052440557445
with increased attention.	273.9138197326406
It was now his turn to look about him; the Hôtel de Ville, a massive	184.25765509325473
sixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from	217.79750601116925
the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below,	367.91622353159767
and Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at	356.4488767322715
one of these openings. If once discovered, he knew he would be lost,	289.12873051078526
for the roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to	198.44529127610332
descend, not through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a	202.58728291030337
similar one conducting to another room.	366.9025282829558
He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having	306.30015297098794
reached it, he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by	327.5294305907165
anyone. At the same minute, one of the little windows of the Hôtel de	358.3215543606831
Ville was thrown open, and the head of a gendarme appeared. For an	185.30808864313082
instant it remained motionless as one of the stone decorations of the	257.9958827575526
building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the head	235.91440734214763
disappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he	269.95613770512426
represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand	324.524818241386
questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.	308.492001100902
“Well?” asked the two gendarmes.	208.64254250215305
“Well, my boys,” said the brigadier, “the brigand must really have	219.38384902108047
escaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets	328.8379936078228
and Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no	193.44135441114264
doubt.”	351.6474742899002
The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that	260.9528200037853
intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a	222.57240093012072
loud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded	319.2417817424823
through the court of the hotel.	276.481887938371
“Ah, what is that?” cried the brigadier.	225.38878107722567
“Some traveller seems impatient,” said the host. “What number was it	256.8187675355205
that rang?”	216.71262069641716
“Number 3.”	244.97173462655155
“Run, waiter!”	280.51315402218364
At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.	219.3174649165969
“Aha!” said the brigadier, stopping the servant, “the person who is	174.0468553045141
ringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend	309.5174896016564
upon him with a gendarme. Who occupies Number 3?”	191.34802047037817
“The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his	232.71277993051595
sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.”	262.19635828580516
The bell here rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.	318.89789924256684
“Follow me, Mr. Commissary!” said the brigadier; “tread in my steps.”	218.42080937779508
“Wait an instant,” said the host; “Number 3 has two staircases,—inside	215.8093297021008
and outside.”	204.08651463465327
“Good,” said the brigadier. “I will take charge of the inside one. Are	302.70844824400996
the carbines loaded?”	321.2631895141161
“Yes, brigadier.”	250.18680444168155
“Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon	172.76251111115815
him; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.”	229.58526267204425
The brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside	335.45620133935233
staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting	308.97875137248775
Andrea had excited in the crowd.	291.6365806316771
This is what had happened: Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend	204.9838739247831
two-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and	256.5634973200396
notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed	335.5650677764537
and noise than he intended. It would have signified little had the room	179.1042564203805
been empty, but unfortunately it was occupied. Two ladies, sleeping in	273.1383964536087
one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the	364.2263421856436
spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man. One of these ladies,	333.6563051030351
the fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through	312.54745143760687
the house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope, rang with all her	192.9301878171221
strength. Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.	343.8126265381702
“For pity’s sake,” he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom	227.68682773253414
he was addressing,—“for pity’s sake do not call assistance! Save me!—I	357.7789632685199
will not harm you.”	336.9392162292814
“Andrea, the murderer!” cried one of the ladies.	318.0998332780106
“Eugénie! Mademoiselle Danglars!” exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.	365.6633363818901
“Help, help!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, taking the bell from her	189.19568144147584
companion’s hand, and ringing it yet more violently.	258.38904687724835
“Save me, I am pursued!” said Andrea, clasping his hands. “For pity,	353.94175715488075
for mercy’s sake do not deliver me up!”	242.62997642708532
“It is too late, they are coming,” said Eugénie.	172.1879755692498
“Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed;	265.51522700068057
you can turn their suspicions and save my life!”	352.4054459373343
50053m	251.0694714966287
The two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the	363.36560345616897
bedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating	275.07703126511547
voice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.	226.05244607365842
“Well, be it so,” at length said Eugénie; “return by the same road you	209.35170147409525
came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.”	183.5640391986901
“Here he is, here he is!” cried a voice from the landing; “here he is!	247.22987807880767
I see him!”	310.4920653596167
The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had discovered Andrea	256.54227329308793
in a posture of entreaty. A violent blow from the butt end of the	179.78069737280822
musket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts, and the	271.5760609743032
broken door fell in. Andrea ran to the other door, leading to the	205.48208368404707
gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood with	196.51252940838623
his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in his	311.9736489320957
clenched hand.	187.52981327033305
“Fly, then!” cried Mademoiselle d’Armilly, whose pity returned as her	324.93184697284846
fears diminished; “fly!”	282.7841389683607
“Or kill yourself!” said Eugénie (in a tone which a Vestal in the	220.80732949136487
amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to	329.9091129039625
finish his vanquished adversary). Andrea shuddered, and looked on the	282.00224219185804
young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood	321.9707866614118
such ferocious honor.	339.1027334592173
“Kill myself?” he cried, throwing down his knife; “why should I do so?”	239.8034691911715
“Why, you said,” answered Mademoiselle Danglars, “that you would be	230.10389977575713
condemned to die like the worst criminals.”	260.2188462378333
50055m	188.4461979976105
“Bah,” said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, “one has friends.”	278.7168816950395
The brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.	213.40352250637685
“Come, come,” said Andrea, “sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there	308.0943286599547
is no occasion to make such a fuss, since I give myself up;” and he	345.8255463597299
held out his hands to be manacled.	312.27614193629097
The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the	246.98877786095323
man of the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a	313.9261394565812
galley-slave. Andrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile	364.90740621780355
asked, “Have you any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars,	288.88486355827933
for in all probability I shall return to Paris?”	235.70220617886253
Eugénie covered her face with her hands.	193.94940035799905
“Oh, oh!” said Andrea, “you need not be ashamed, even though you did	245.11797885576055
post after me. Was I not nearly your husband?”	252.1587140052779
50056m	322.3607935397281
And with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to	255.09777033001487
their own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour	286.5236547269863
after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.	318.4613470731251
The gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but	314.8130882124698
they were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of	253.80635553381424
curious glances and whispering voices.	298.65479021103664
Eugénie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear,	188.10876420188566
and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage.	196.23747096017135
“Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?” she exclaimed, throwing	341.7311900582588
herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d’Armilly, her eyes sparkling	281.3066809357946
with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world	344.6770021614547
had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single blow.	193.1733913855201
The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre, at Brussels. The	357.2793422556768
same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.	306.73723908735224
 Chapter 99. The Law	326.9452731344819
We have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle	223.88583741203414
d’Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being	297.42345679337086
that everyone was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think	253.20918945879407
of theirs.	324.3751100556252
We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude of his	272.8346623281925
debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness, who	347.2910449560258
after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had	370.60655162913923
struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray. The	333.2355631878302
baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her	351.6748979461987
of a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugénie’s character, could not	283.22594982498674
fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations	356.81632274670363
which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her	326.1000394966801
ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom	231.87733530186338
and a type of perfection.	308.0201186201952
Now, Madame Danglars feared Eugénie’s sagacity and the influence of	259.5803662539436
Mademoiselle d’Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous	228.15563687962214
expression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,—an expression	177.018849052378
which seemed to imply that she understood all her mother’s amorous and	184.88342470592318
pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw	299.1749545833528
that Eugénie detested Debray, not only because he was a source of	294.3717547713438
dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at	205.33732927291194
once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to	238.02460376074612
withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as	271.65694659403727
animals upon two legs without feathers.	324.81834962616426
Unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through	209.91305566283782
a certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as	248.7842749871473
others, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the	343.3779000991769
marriage of Eugénie had not taken place, not only because the match was	291.248150370169
good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it	359.11328027278944
would also set her at liberty. She ran therefore to Debray, who, after	355.30826936763043
having, like the rest of Paris, witnessed the contract scene and the	283.9612535774994
scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was	275.7460001330717
chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of	269.29387557987866
conversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the	328.6957213778195
world.	249.88739744928682
At the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and	264.13598624929034
concealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray’s	221.42194815420157
apartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the	350.86154033531375
young man was not at home, Debray was occupied in repelling the	295.64421341362356
insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the	197.0121937704292
terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the	242.03024525569353
family, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions. Debray did	209.19657569583163
not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed his	315.4463623591133
mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of	368.5830610176501
Eugénie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the	300.60537062556807
same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in	196.65258020056024
his heart. Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become	367.8135914381878
interesting during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till	178.49502192186037
one o’clock in the morning.	364.11890121239617
Meanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of	333.5751698494173
Debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,	189.90737971728126
which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed,	303.37683060570964
Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his	334.54840796915386
absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.	191.08100964320107
At twenty minutes to twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting,	287.14197918372867
returned home. Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes	370.1318055570647
in one respect, they seldom return home after twelve o’clock. The	197.9791724419685
baroness returned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugénie used in	186.37241650170208
leaving it; she ran lightly upstairs, and with an aching heart entered	300.18170963379396
her apartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugénie. She was	190.7806024267326
fearful of exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter’s	256.9770741797588
innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eugénie’s	195.17128600246355
door, and hearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place.	333.1146143551896
Madame Danglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome	329.0847332304236
with the terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to	175.78847955869816
sleep. She called the maid and questioned her.	281.70736599312806
“Mademoiselle Eugénie,” said the maid, “retired to her apartment with	310.13480786576565
Mademoiselle d’Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they	221.71125181026702
desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.”	365.9702723889441
Since then the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought	251.20451239568405
the young ladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore,	275.07865025030117
went to bed without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the	312.9678649998598
recent events. In proportion as her memory became clearer, the	211.38173510867227
occurrences of the evening were revealed in their true light; what she	257.4045008445838
had taken for confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as	288.8915676153864
something distressing, was in reality a disgrace. And then the baroness	183.88134590385692
remembered that she had felt no pity for poor Mercédès, who had been	364.1993541278938
afflicted with as severe a blow through her husband and son.	272.44677681110466
“Eugénie,” she said to herself, “is lost, and so are we. The affair, as	211.98405140007196
it will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as	240.68833996056057
ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound. How fortunate that	250.19294812552818
Eugénie is possessed of that strange character which has so often made	281.45644989063953
me tremble!”	202.55705759151212
And her glance was turned towards heaven, where a mysterious Providence	294.32452583928523
disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even a vice, sometimes	326.04948815551825
produces a blessing. And then her thoughts, cleaving through space like	318.74567537020744
a bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti. This Andrea was a wretch, a	331.64678835598795
robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the effects of a sort	235.59559388661663
of education, if not a complete one; he had been presented to the world	226.2988228796862
with the appearance of an immense fortune, supported by an honorable	331.3578726728715
name. How could she extricate herself from this labyrinth? To whom	297.48521623989194
would she apply to help her out of this painful situation? Debray, to	199.7834365854692
whom she had run, with the first instinct of a woman towards the man	193.45165710688556
she loves, and who yet betrays her,—Debray could but give her advice,	313.6864356501412
she must apply to someone more powerful than he.	221.0419520008711
The baroness then thought of M. de Villefort. It was M. de Villefort	332.18459014623284
who had remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though	263.15323097276473
they had been strangers. But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not	212.90336743227084
a merciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties,	266.564205217853
but the friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the	239.97467915764554
very core of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the	316.66176487961405
surgeon, who wished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious	272.5773871300984
association with the disgraced young man they had presented to the	180.68804040290624
world as their son-in-law. And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars,	244.42386036827827
had acted in this way, no one could suppose that he had been previously	334.77502118044094
acquainted with, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea’s intrigues.	171.85003486909517
Villefort’s conduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the	296.1392600576981
baroness as if shaped for their mutual advantage. But the inflexibility	344.82133516194415
of the procureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and	184.48806523692065
if she could not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she	311.76464173111253
would, at least, obtain all the indulgence he could allow. She would	360.80664618413755
invoke the past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by	323.7784622585874
the remembrance of guilty, yet happy days. M. de Villefort would stifle	327.17732367068004
the affair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea	316.6967464547456
to fly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called	171.42760266325158
contempt of court. And after this reasoning she slept easily.	302.30168815741985
At nine o’clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her	244.733644968777
maid or giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in	303.27180304794456
the same simple style as on the previous night; then running	232.18542625242
downstairs, she left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a	322.0681148058175
cab, and drove to M. de Villefort’s house.	191.34570349048278
For the last month this wretched house had presented the gloomy	228.59337426791728
appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague. Some of the	314.006087561605
apartments were closed within and without; the shutters were only	350.57962280536657
opened to admit a minute’s air, showing the scared face of a footman,	176.98800222773394
and immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a	177.2422058889987
gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each	250.97653404551806
other in a low voice, “Will there be another funeral today at the	234.89685266021826
procureur’s house?”	243.09216137475482
Madame Danglars involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the	263.2762126256884
mansion; descending from the cab, she approached the door with	321.15937257621016
trembling knees, and rang the bell. Three times did the bell ring with	287.7300983547856
a dull, heavy sound, seeming to participate, in the general sadness,	318.151954318942
before the concierge appeared and peeped through the door, which he	229.13379064900352
opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard. He saw a lady,	322.7380600129934
a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady, and yet the door remained almost	314.398370384518
closed.	245.06212364801274
“Do you intend opening the door?” said the baroness.	362.98990223434004
“First, madame, who are you?”	337.0287010501411
“Who am I? You know me well enough.”	303.86730426380325
“We no longer know anyone, madame.”	183.5579213938958
“You must be mad, my friend,” said the baroness.	356.5027786420738
“Where do you come from?”	314.07978568828923
“Oh, this is too much!”	314.9766362582882
“Madame, these are my orders; excuse me. Your name?”	227.06352978970867
“The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times.”	290.08000999315124
“Possibly, madame. And now, what do you want?”	347.01308688814345
“Oh, how extraordinary! I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the	258.6694681336395
impertinence of his servants.”	344.70324598024797
“Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here	258.31052687056103
without an order from M. d’Avrigny, or without speaking to the	315.78303092903536
procureur.”	284.7559953372686
“Well, I have business with the procureur.”	193.54816040155464
“Is it pressing business?”	311.03555191584826
“You can imagine so, since I have not even brought my carriage out yet.	236.19612943819226
But enough of this—here is my card, take it to your master.”	189.39486049020235
“Madame will await my return?”	310.53198382077096
“Yes; go.”	274.2569380177496
The concierge closed the door, leaving Madame Danglars in the street.	208.620133146055
She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was opened wide	214.46792932827273
enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was again	297.0144239195383
shut. Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge took a	348.77548256875355
whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and blew it.	183.3729039417692
The valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps.	255.94569628337183
“You will excuse this poor fellow, madame,” he said, as he preceded the	228.133110700781
baroness, “but his orders are precise, and M. de Villefort begged me to	205.60248489394212
tell you that he could not act otherwise.”	311.873789715679
In the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been	191.6395605359046
admitted with the same precautions. The baroness ascended the steps;	326.07970215584663
she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to	265.36504700505986
magnify her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never	246.9016346339851
lost sight of her for an instant, she was introduced to the	311.9123821436745
magistrate’s study.	225.08644028863188
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit,	357.17219159887577
the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so	305.7730067135233
insulting, that she began by complaining of it. But Villefort, raising	215.76255689866784
his head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile	332.75562179766365
that her complaints died upon her lips.	336.4427378711334
“Forgive my servants,” he said, “for a terror I cannot blame them for;	230.70693014651445
from being suspected they have become suspicious.”	293.1459771302482
Madame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate	264.37160428151566
alluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never	208.2839571373731
have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far.	227.63118598527467
“You too, then, are unhappy?” she said.	271.0156438609231
“Yes, madame,” replied the magistrate.	268.0073212929858
“Then you pity me!”	190.2496774204192
“Sincerely, madame.”	333.9424252646941
“And you understand what brings me here?”	343.7938380040986
“You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just	286.7039931126747
happened?”	177.44504178171468
“Yes, sir,—a fearful misfortune.”	322.1396291158677
“You mean a mischance.”	317.2590722054652
“A mischance?” repeated the baroness.	260.0509037760998
“Alas, madame,” said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of	318.4110529443966
manner, “I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.”	365.47232593053553
“And do you suppose this will be forgotten?”	275.1083300276995
“Everything will be forgotten, madame,” said Villefort. “Your daughter	327.7366948193776
will be married tomorrow, if not today—in a week, if not tomorrow; and	301.75473416526734
I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter.”	274.4604271623096
Madame Danglars gazed on Villefort, stupefied to find him so almost	338.0995953274074
insultingly calm. “Am I come to a friend?” she asked in a tone full of	175.50344944797243
mournful dignity.	252.87195278449238
“You know that you are, madame,” said Villefort, whose pale cheeks	201.29607950686085
became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance. And truly this	201.98462529784206
assurance carried him back to different events from those now occupying	222.1454655271128
the baroness and him.	286.85926208799674
“Well, then, be more affectionate, my dear Villefort,” said the	223.6631217256241
baroness. “Speak to me not as a magistrate, but as a friend; and when I	237.8449532436404
am in bitter anguish of spirit, do not tell me that I ought to be gay.”	340.27190215230087
Villefort bowed.	317.05255442695216
“When I hear misfortunes named, madame,” he said, “I have within the	356.77167679189597
last few months contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own, and	353.9648111215478
then I cannot help drawing up an egotistical parallel in my mind. That	303.3734520631477
is the reason that by the side of my misfortunes yours appear to me	262.6344547611752
mere mischances; that is why my dreadful position makes yours appear	252.68593753534682
enviable. But this annoys you; let us change the subject. You were	177.93420706757155
saying, madame——”	355.4479868060579
“I came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done	196.80193812527506
with this impostor?”	202.45345791253285
“Impostor,” repeated Villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to	304.48074892865105
extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others. Impostor, indeed!—M.	204.64391733568576
Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather M. Benedetto, is nothing more nor less	206.2732552046654
than an assassin!”	271.93148693906073
“Sir, I do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more	327.3314495607382
severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply	171.1898648056632
will you strike our family. Come, forget him for a moment, and instead	202.49873878887587
of pursuing him, let him go.”	366.1579425772833
“You are too late, madame; the orders are issued.”	319.4582568841371
“Well, should he be arrested—do they think they will arrest him?”	195.17376238733294
“I hope so.”	355.65952406586183
“If they should arrest him (I know that sometimes prisons afford means	206.76144353199356
of escape), will you leave him in prison?”	263.54120479889355
The procureur shook his head.	318.345139287597
“At least keep him there till my daughter be married.”	195.32198850398407
“Impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.”	302.5314903941372
“What, even for me?” said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.	281.66044792564946
“For all, even for myself among the rest,” replied Villefort.	231.3529320263283
50063m	311.6401835848297
“Ah!” exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the	331.4566855518499
exclamation betrayed. Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance	343.427808731067
which reads the secrets of the heart.	361.39942398648213
“Yes, I know what you mean,” he said; “you refer to the terrible rumors	208.3417405903255
spread abroad in the world, that the deaths which have kept me in	188.84757817986565
mourning for the last three months, and from which Valentine has only	246.23955437544944
escaped by a miracle, have not happened by natural means.”	362.8810036064498
“I was not thinking of that,” replied Madame Danglars quickly.	340.60470554087703
“Yes, you were thinking of it, and with justice. You could not help	196.94447091816158
thinking of it, and saying to yourself, ‘you, who pursue crime so	215.76029635043392
vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your	212.17894597460455
dwelling?’” The baroness became pale. “You were saying this, were you	251.12873472826072
not?”	205.5184624673955
“Well, I own it.”	222.21095843069952
“I will answer you.”	241.0593105176112
Villefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting	246.50964449270845
both hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual:	218.86224855994212
“There are crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are	302.82373444381835
unknown, and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but	328.7256334627083
when the culprits are discovered” (Villefort here extended his hand	276.5324023859943
toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk)—“when they are	197.40427858001846
discovered, I swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever	341.9907377388829
they may be they shall die. Now, after the oath I have just taken, and	324.60279731693
which I will keep, madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!”	201.39231642537234
“But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?”	291.02453113204655
“Listen; this is his description: ‘Benedetto, condemned, at the age of	336.62210247493863
sixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.’ He promised well,	231.55500732051078
as you see—first a runaway, then an assassin.”	308.6934772400516
“And who is this wretch?”	312.95926116728833
“Who can tell?—a vagabond, a Corsican.”	329.2086205298232
“Has no one owned him?”	370.02863897697586
“No one; his parents are unknown.”	175.46296300710165
“But who was the man who brought him from Lucca?”	172.8049506219807
“Another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice.” The baroness	261.25296613661914
clasped her hands.	229.4605406740176
“Villefort,” she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating manner.	213.32064778209698
“For Heaven’s sake, madame,” said Villefort, with a firmness of	281.81909354961556
expression not altogether free from harshness—“for Heaven’s sake, do	217.76027387821125
not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch! What am I?—the law. Has the	224.32947841223847
law any eyes to witness your grief? Has the law ears to be melted by	182.7085358063943
your sweet voice? Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections	244.15171758607903
you endeavor to recall? No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it	352.7671877284773
commands it strikes. You will tell me that I am a living being, and not	364.49657124155
a code—a man, and not a volume. Look at me, madame—look around me. Has	311.4678097295815
mankind treated me as a brother? Have men loved me? Have they spared	290.6519620497338
me? Has anyone shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my hands?	259.9953901759294
No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!	215.3649332703378
50065m	364.35542488840224
“Woman, siren that you are, do you persist in fixing on me that	364.478305776209
fascinating eye, which reminds me that I ought to blush? Well, be it	338.6436229405367
so; let me blush for the faults you know, and perhaps—perhaps for even	243.07354530655482
more than those! But having sinned myself,—it may be more deeply than	244.40519500366457
others,—I never rest till I have torn the disguises from my	241.93627389927354
fellow-creatures, and found out their weaknesses. I have always found	263.3869447304684
them; and more,—I repeat it with joy, with triumph,—I have always found	278.57277824671087
some proof of human perversity or error. Every criminal I condemn seems	333.09677452773326
to me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the rest.	224.29500882022046
Alas, alas, alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike at	314.05758956601824
wickedness!”	322.7844709160182
Villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave	355.11055734006766
a ferocious eloquence to his words.	320.2356661782198
“But”’ said Madame Danglars, resolving to make a last effort, “this	295.245363158086
young man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody.”	328.19258264489827
“So much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so	252.39306102417294
ordained that he may have none to weep his fate.”	225.58569689128024
“But this is trampling on the weak, sir.”	293.18187337571874
“The weakness of a murderer!”	221.57016209529007
“His dishonor reflects upon us.”	195.8102372886637
“Is not death in my house?”	324.64344644961267
“Oh, sir,” exclaimed the baroness, “you are without pity for others,	255.76300271786235
well, then, I tell you they will have no mercy on you!”	315.43974323794157
“Be it so!” said Villefort, raising his arms to heaven with a	321.9324222551916
threatening gesture.	262.80162295712285
“At least, delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have	369.70880062709307
six months before us.”	224.91471356190445
“No, madame,” said Villefort; “instructions have been given. There are	180.08453798425697
yet five days left; five days are more than I require. Do you not think	341.05003625021317
that I also long for forgetfulness? While working night and day, I	236.02673208983379
sometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the	235.45070319813846
same sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better	237.1361213446732
than suffering.”	286.5904203783514
“But, sir, he has fled; let him escape—inaction is a pardonable	276.6164487657908
offence.”	265.0741888608991
“I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was	261.65951990000127
employed, and at this very minute——”	174.6328194593035
“Sir,” said the valet de chambre, entering the room, “a dragoon has	293.5118182680837
brought this despatch from the Minister of the Interior.”	279.53222701232073
Villefort seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame	254.32280778344312
Danglars trembled with fear; Villefort started with joy.	307.1962303426815
“Arrested!” he exclaimed; “he was taken at Compiègne, and all is over.”	227.070297303225
Madame Danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.	343.1749306266163
“Adieu, sir,” she said.	241.03161986946412
“Adieu, madame,” replied the king’s attorney, as in an almost joyful	312.390722047494
manner he conducted her to the door. Then, turning to his desk, he	179.2370016716323
said, striking the letter with the back of his right hand:	334.4715528319613
“Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and two cases of arson, I only	308.7662210817747
wanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a splendid session!”	277.99334176476054
 Chapter 100. The Apparition	301.65172105414257
As the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet	242.8675046519179
recovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;	350.7018660494583
and it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,	274.32479429038005
that she heard all the strange events we have related; we mean the	271.3091774051052
flight of Eugénie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather	215.07738703810406
Benedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against	212.92168442862402
him. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the	183.77423829123384
same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of	281.68669600295055
health. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and	335.6647195555565
confused forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented	300.8332020332213
themselves before her eyes.	287.0597489581731
During the daytime Valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,	178.70419488327124
owing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be	331.0438810398081
carried to his granddaughter’s room, and watched her with his paternal	215.2603101816588
tenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,	242.170607466414
frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child.	217.41994245478367
At six o’clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d’Avrigny	193.91244140854903
himself arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young	295.5969342190559
girl, and then M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor’s	361.03929698075126
choice succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o’clock,	272.916971013578
when Valentine was asleep. As she went downstairs she gave the keys of	298.6531159985422
Valentine’s room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the	171.43510571480167
sick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little	267.74555652732533
Edward.	337.07496951167303
Every morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,	324.95676955524664
and, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.	210.75958155427284
Certainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous	276.72747438533554
excitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him	341.9874764785768
when, half distracted, he had rushed to the count’s house, that if she	322.786558569224
were not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had	338.72253615887377
elapsed, and Valentine still lived.	341.9775561725255
The nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her	353.3814974868243
sleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking	206.2426283902103
hours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from	325.40690908484817
the alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass	276.8178689141741
and repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever with	348.4620238190107
their trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother	336.47285042796125
threatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes	353.4877345407609
mere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even	277.48770155738515
the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and	370.9813790825434
this state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep,	283.5837943483299
heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake	281.1179516886545
till daylight.	281.52958890559273
On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of the flight	257.6363776449451
of Eugénie and the arrest of Benedetto,—Villefort having retired as	340.05183519957035
well as Noirtier and d’Avrigny,—her thoughts wandered in a confused	208.28860581732755
maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events she had	271.7566794089944
just heard.	226.97049296725103
Eleven o’clock had struck. The nurse, having placed the beverage	211.81363985947183
prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the	246.41350466897586
door, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the	229.5227761177359
kitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had	201.02033480127778
for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the	227.8348529145469
house of the king’s attorney. Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing	349.87345321863
in the room which had been so carefully locked.	205.09363371200683
Ten minutes had elapsed since the nurse had left; Valentine, who for	302.38933263029196
the last hour had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly,	279.597343944305
incapable of controlling her ideas, was forced to yield to the	232.59653247623416
excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a	298.8937176761436
succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images. The	187.11056411914544
night-lamp threw out countless rays, each resolving itself into some	206.3042335300027
strange form to her disordered imagination, when suddenly by its	275.74094280034086
flickering light Valentine thought she saw the door of her library,	259.057106964396
which was in the recess by the chimney-piece, open slowly, though she	210.7161447306633
in vain listened for the sound of the hinges on which it turned.	357.7180282827883
At any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull and	271.6152231794296
summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present	288.4467193415553
situation. Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but	221.7683729826779
the children of her imagination, and the conviction was strengthened by	362.34160732669494
the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal	193.88667034042658
phantoms, who disappeared with the coming of daylight.	322.6136036057163
From behind the door a human figure appeared, but the girl was too	340.6103058956412
familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only	200.85871475340366
stared, hoping to recognize Morrel. The figure advanced towards the bed	216.55750088410355
and appeared to listen with profound attention. At this moment a ray of	196.1637879780925
light glanced across the face of the midnight visitor.	359.2590581081888
“It is not he,” she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this	361.0663937950686
was but a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form.	297.9914229275763
Still, she felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she	326.57084828337383
remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to	173.37844648655565
drink, for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay	323.94116745403346
her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time	361.59888782045124
she suffered less. Valentine therefore reached her hand towards the	262.98589023111737
glass, but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed the apparition	359.2735362570875
advanced more quickly towards her, and approached the young girl so	196.1841604210267
closely that she fancied she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of	189.20333126177763
his hand.	348.50017849056235
This time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything	183.9029820650493
Valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really	307.3726207494629
alive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not	307.027757840597
deceived made her shudder. The pressure she felt was evidently intended	268.46831514337595
to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it. Then the figure, from	281.6722845185196
whom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting	333.40901292703956
than menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held	274.80792817930654
it up, as if to test its transparency. This did not seem sufficient;	241.3220106843195
the man, or rather the ghost—for he trod so softly that no sound was	246.56837052642004
heard—then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.	336.2761391286115
Valentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction. Every	178.9475389417325
minute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another	299.522298231215
vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again	225.98980512106704
approached her, and said in an agitated voice, “Now you may drink.”	186.19841900909918
Valentine shuddered. It was the first time one of these visions had	254.40786797588368
ever addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an	221.0130543043693
exclamation. The man placed his finger on her lips.	328.9363783987953
“The Count of Monte Cristo!” she murmured.	210.9889643587033
It was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl’s mind	211.5398873765275
as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands	182.23596006568042
trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her. Still, the	370.8443598438635
presence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and	347.8277767607567
extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem	193.20664387935125
impossibilities to her shattered reason.	174.87077382396689
“Do not call anyone—do not be alarmed,” said the count; “do not let a	317.1826556485049
shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast; the man	252.8010689569286
standing before you, Valentine (for this time it is no ghost), is	295.66986877314037
nothing more than the tenderest father and the most respectful friend	258.54334354323464
you could dream of.”	364.7342852852252
Valentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence	171.56735889833985
of a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a	340.07391216851113
syllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, “If your	330.60637305667285
intentions are pure, why are you here?” The count’s marvellous sagacity	243.05514615551192
understood all that was passing in the young girl’s mind.	298.89883420797884
“Listen to me,” he said, “or, rather, look upon me; look at my face,	363.3797790936049
paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days I	315.0810127172979
have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to	182.94191703319927
protect and preserve you for Maximilian.”	343.9096240558033
The blood mounted rapidly to the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just	314.064806393189
announced by the count dispelled all the fear with which his presence	344.39194881588014
had inspired her.	280.07722039953774
“Maximilian!” she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her,	336.60184779841506
that she repeated it—“Maximilian!—has he then owned all to you?”	264.906688046425
“Everything. He told me your life was his, and I have promised him that	178.9158055905794
you shall live.”	174.70927151401415
“You have promised him that I shall live?”	296.07291675771285
“Yes.”	316.9279365554815
“But, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection. Are you a doctor?”	335.6772360037811
“Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.”	226.221483262572
“But you say you have watched?” said Valentine uneasily; “where have	191.40473795891916
you been?—I have not seen you.”	352.3350035869445
The count extended his hand towards the library.	324.3083439405084
“I was hidden behind that door,” he said, “which leads into the next	324.08124740225344
house, which I have rented.”	312.856050340927
Valentine turned her eyes away, and, with an indignant expression of	297.8418906715253
pride and modest fear, exclaimed:	243.0297749117335
“Sir, I think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and	329.7043885873025
that what you call protection is more like an insult.”	225.28875427770953
“Valentine,” he answered, “during my long watch over you, all I have	265.6128299192609
observed has been what people visited you, what nourishment was	330.3316837945568
prepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared	172.24792919939588
dangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the	264.5579336456938
place of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing	182.8839531180355
the death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.”	330.93883521941393
“Poison—death!” exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the	364.79515201072087
influence of some feverish hallucination; “what are you saying, sir?”	324.01995808465483
50071m	351.5681293716899
“Hush, my child,” said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her	180.51619116185836
lips, “I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;” and the	293.04784968433347
count took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which	342.1853985820506
he poured a few drops into the glass. “Drink this, and then take	171.3253900366978
nothing more tonight.”	352.6757018095144
Valentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she touched the	222.14101030534627
glass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the glass, drank	293.00163265458673
half its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who smiled and	304.6579306187555
swallowed the rest.	360.14571760512956
“Oh, yes,” she exclaimed, “I recognize the flavor of my nocturnal	262.19456707740426
beverage which refreshed me so much, and seemed to ease my aching	227.4922207187177
brain. Thank you, sir, thank you!”	238.3190087318812
“This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,”	276.755094236554
said the count. “But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched	251.0572829079204
hours I have endured—the torture to which I have submitted when I saw	254.91546716169074
the deadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you	280.52492988926673
should drink it before I could find time to throw it away!”	197.22413929377922
“Sir,” said Valentine, at the height of her terror, “you say you	357.4557415951262
endured tortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass;	247.1987560585186
but if you saw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?”	297.8924795533005
“Yes.”	194.8771398693939
Valentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which	220.31148351181088
appeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with	255.8009391124507
the cold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror.	354.60737366156974
“You saw the person?” repeated the young girl.	370.298960795992
“Yes,” repeated the count.	237.81471976384
“What you tell me is horrible, sir. You wish to make me believe	354.8440448610661
something too dreadful. What?—attempt to murder me in my father’s	295.3405445588986
house, in my room, on my bed of sickness? Oh, leave me, sir; you are	297.54043649782625
tempting me—you make me doubt the goodness of Providence—it is	327.22744844759393
impossible, it cannot be!”	320.97196982527714
“Are you the first that this hand has stricken? Have you not seen M. de	297.3905579460515
Saint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran, Barrois, all fall? Would not M.	212.47998739776244
Noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been	331.9107681647131
pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the	248.66488637526518
poison?”	367.8737027723358
“Oh, Heaven,” said Valentine; “is this the reason why grandpapa has	360.34910010234046
made me share all his beverages during the last month?”	303.8792189406835
“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of	288.0095211254715
dried orange-peel?”	301.6307075303512
“Oh, yes, yes!”	361.46795877218324
“Then that explains all,” said Monte Cristo. “Your grandfather knows,	291.2388392214767
then, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.	317.60183900365655
He has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal	262.1049950394713
effects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already	309.63028287236693
impregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a	297.70744030993035
more deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally	328.87887707501204
but too fatal.”	213.965626643943
“But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?”	213.66988896561134
“Let me also ask you a question. Have you never seen anyone enter your	290.1932592635257
room at night?”	211.83853508908865
“Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach,	288.6730262290888
and disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish	189.32942049560373
imagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the	320.42732761414084
influence of delirium.”	181.2624911101307
“Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?”	261.5128944009438
50073m	193.13051688443747
“No,” said Valentine; “who could desire my death?”	251.59766923714312
“You shall know it now, then,” said Monte Cristo, listening.	335.19322325381677
“How do you mean?” said Valentine, looking anxiously around.	183.20576103244923
“Because you are not feverish or delirious tonight, but thoroughly	332.4024746854251
awake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose.”	270.8715687232069
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, wiping off the drops which ran down	349.9796631981093
her forehead. Midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to	325.64346539079986
strike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl.	290.9988389693881
“Valentine,” said the count, “summon up all your courage; still the	269.6792139029192
beatings of your heart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be	173.0475213816665
asleep; then you will see.”	207.0912362535371
Valentine seized the count’s hand. “I think I hear a noise,” she said;	303.24274237428017
“leave me.”	206.50513342829493
“Good-bye, for the present,” replied the count, walking upon tiptoe	287.3528182733751
towards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and	201.20447795334877
paternal that the young girl’s heart was filled with gratitude.	301.18802187781284
Before closing the door he turned around once more, and said, “Not a	349.8665763460224
movement—not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be	217.46680059075265
killed before I have the power of helping you.”	219.2088425559985
And with this fearful injunction the count disappeared through the	260.1276224976751
door, which noiselessly closed after him.	288.9719919227243
 Chapter 101. Locusta	295.0611460631825
Valentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of	235.856107076463
Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different	307.6353522177832
directions, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was	240.8060965247205
silent. Then Valentine’s attention was engrossed by the clock in her	358.4465587134422
room, which marked the seconds. She began counting them, remarking that	219.92112992311877
they were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she	370.6334135848837
doubted,—the inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should	296.64112746508965
desire her death. Why should they? To what end? What had she done to	324.9536703016258
excite the malice of an enemy?	338.217336032464
There was no fear of her falling asleep. One terrible idea pressed upon	260.4206982750054
her mind,—that someone existed in the world who had attempted to	254.79795682734633
assassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again.	214.0515419876857
Supposing this person, wearied at the inefficacy of the poison, should,	210.83748440408186
as Monte Cristo intimated, have recourse to steel!—What if the count	350.8496490915996
should have no time to run to her rescue!—What if her last moments were	177.82664673634494
approaching, and she should never again see Morrel!	213.70508512215622
When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself, Valentine was	349.084760972038
nearly persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help. But through the	307.64384504724933
door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count—that eye which	360.04836507534037
lived in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much	187.4411004071829
shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever	187.29288945223274
repay his adventurous and devoted friendship.	258.93095597060903
Twenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more, and	306.02119769701505
at last the clock struck the half-hour.	307.27035215187925
Just then the sound of finger-nails slightly grating against the door	177.59393846643422
of the library informed Valentine that the count was still watching,	287.4464668511224
and recommended her to do the same; at the same time, on the opposite	304.6931683981221
side, that is towards Edward’s room, Valentine fancied that she heard	244.472432812877
the creaking of the floor; she listened attentively, holding her breath	252.22912936337406
till she was nearly suffocated; the lock turned, and the door slowly	315.3361703949857
opened. Valentine had raised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely	234.83228086671454
time to throw herself down on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm;	275.0987119903747
then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating with indescribable	347.28574439579586
terror, she awaited the event.	324.73944973719995
Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine	190.87070399939367
summoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which	323.9570973127609
announces tranquil sleep.	324.2653558992243
“Valentine!” said a low voice.	261.54498166248356
The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.	310.8263983380954
“Valentine,” repeated the same voice.	264.7147752800846
Still silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was	312.3590534308541
still, excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of	271.264778119417
some liquid being poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she	364.4916426311613
ventured to open her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw	247.74878651386678
a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her	309.9973545161696
glass. During this short time Valentine must have held her breath, or	196.5952288730881
moved in some slight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and	257.2566729912819
leaned over the bed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine	237.1688869556886
slept: it was Madame de Villefort.	354.4065344796286
On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,	175.87835481342705
which caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly	211.60742422039746
stepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,	345.7108600059239
she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of	191.2724046956128
Valentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;	256.2663422240564
she fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp	187.83974154901853
knife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself	283.484743788585
to close her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate	192.2458278786151
organs of our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost	217.42887346961294
impossible at this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the	224.75952087901862
eyelid open and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however,	366.7164697567261
reassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular	237.723231992528
breathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the	304.23894970780674
curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the	191.51553932101757
glass. Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she had	368.11210538544356
left the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm—the fair	349.8487160526016
round arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread	347.2083733370135
death around her.	306.35898742796917
50077m	315.8442832595671
It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine	285.59899440496093
during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.	339.63437163670284
The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the	274.5572122124566
stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to	216.7687264931096
insensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door	173.6155236981857
again turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.	246.61745053344129
“Well,” said he, “do you still doubt?”	310.12563316402725
“Oh,” murmured the young girl.	182.54380267310938
“Have you seen?”	247.75762714310312
“Alas!”	353.2395252073244
“Did you recognize?” Valentine groaned.	327.9930116734838
“Oh, yes;” she said, “I saw, but I cannot believe!”	303.3287144301954
“Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian’s death?”	222.2452977527483
“Oh,” repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, “can I not leave the	366.3111003412423
house?—can I not escape?”	276.6837051349074
“Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you	345.64759989685126
everywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be	365.0758617244228
offered to you disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water	239.79496015746525
you drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.”	230.47235767285358
“But did you not say that my kind grandfather’s precaution had	370.5289309654288
neutralized the poison?”	234.80363609901053
“Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and	274.9410476102555
the quantity increased.” He took the glass and raised it to his lips.	183.18124322370102
“It is already done,” he said; “brucine is no longer employed, but a	179.84443924881197
simple narcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it	309.52448800944455
has been dissolved. If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has	321.4663812447174
poured into your glass, Valentine—Valentine—you would have been	348.4141181680102
doomed!”	362.6166890863292
“But,” exclaimed the young girl, “why am I thus pursued?”	218.95865615709795
“Why?—are you so kind—so good—so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot	301.0912478499664
understand, Valentine?”	285.93969833611715
“No, I have never injured her.”	187.10328731730453
“But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you	226.21999989252248
prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.”	321.94912618151943
“How so? The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my	314.800769979542
relations.”	293.7871752980477
“Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died;	211.59102974603724
that is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir;	362.7716276959119
that is why you, in your turn, are to die—it is because your father	362.417845711111
would inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to	200.49333883043587
his.”	321.3191551158544
“Edward? Poor child! Are all these crimes committed on his account?”	187.42165346753288
“Ah, then you at length understand?”	282.7156869128501
“Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!”	264.7531148653146
“Valentine, you are an angel!”	234.2819349389151
“But why is my grandfather allowed to live?”	309.9772808860466
“It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert	352.34026256348875
to your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime	281.87367907912676
appearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.”	261.709445368288
“And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been	331.6476519627349
invented by a woman?”	356.8369517653217
“Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hôtel des Postes, at Perugia,	357.563919725805
seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning	313.55730412596074
upon _aqua tofana_? Well, ever since then, the infernal project has	365.9080988768677
been ripening in her brain.”	279.9539782611535
“Ah, then, indeed, sir,” said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, “I see	303.54135338617704
that I am condemned to die!”	195.24476171085982
“No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is	231.73724350140063
conquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine—live to be	201.80004340016512
happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to	226.2903204437101
insure this you must rely on me.”	288.68143151755135
“Command me, sir—what am I to do?”	171.14205899890027
“You must blindly take what I give you.”	291.22017597523313
“Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!”	360.9576596448834
“You must not confide in anyone—not even in your father.”	263.2982425984904
“My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?” asked	179.5327446310619
Valentine, clasping her hands.	266.3695628659545
“No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations,	332.26974785621445
ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally;	185.2138573741261
it is he who should have watched over you—he should have occupied my	243.58490829190762
place—he should have emptied that glass—he should have risen against	354.79607841282285
the assassin. Spectre against spectre!” he murmured in a low voice, as	322.8280104655474
he concluded his sentence.	341.00936802688227
“Sir,” said Valentine, “I will do all I can to live, for there are two	285.9237379447702
beings who love me and will die if I die—my grandfather and	314.45993341635096
Maximilian.”	279.1935836240873
“I will watch over them as I have over you.”	221.4799345812229
“Well, sir, do as you will with me;” and then she added, in a low	281.3284049741423
voice, “oh, heavens, what will befall me?”	234.9473426985897
“Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer;	196.65604330557565
though you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though you	297.6137839364377
should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear; even	351.2818730820143
though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.	280.3832265990762
Reassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: ‘At this moment, a	335.4519634572283
friend, a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian,	272.85986102260057
watches over me!’”	319.8499355953055
“Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!”	182.19157963843554
“Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?”	346.32171671337323
“I would rather die a hundred times—oh, yes, die!”	291.55106948389505
“No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that	344.45546087262755
you will not complain, but hope?”	207.72770591171138
“I will think of Maximilian!”	341.49868369248804
“You are my own darling child, Valentine! I alone can save you, and I	323.96828758860573
will.”	238.44691165574662
Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,—for she felt	366.6234484428808
that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,—and began to pray, and	301.5283155091462
while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her	240.39404244394922
white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and that the	243.86447807000735
pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her	171.40295000841914
nightdress. Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl’s arm,	280.71248286287266
drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat, and said with a paternal	286.55996240466374
smile:	245.84687197267897
“My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness	208.25467978913997
of Providence and the love of Maximilian.” Valentine gave him a look	281.6003985775199
full of gratitude, and remained as docile as a child.	318.73823101198263
Then he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised	172.80356302125523
the golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea,	271.798794937582
which he placed in her hand. She took it, and looked attentively on the	341.73424640291023
count; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector	279.8802050080798
which commanded her veneration. She evidently interrogated him by her	213.78729225742802
look.	236.06492509146693
“Yes,” said he.	240.2292008303757
Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it.	356.23449661117377
“And now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try and gain a	233.30051950008675
little sleep, for you are saved.”	274.4402471333419
“Go,” said Valentine, “whatever happens, I promise you not to fear.”	199.98909696687952
Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who	259.14263143040137
gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the	302.9977510478169
count had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the	368.2719942854985
contents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had	352.66213809489585
taken it, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after	289.1120278267827
throwing a farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence	198.48116829248346
and innocence of an angel at the feet of the Lord.	235.8358084313029
 Chapter 102. Valentine	309.1100787884819
The night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the	277.85147284600396
last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe	201.43413915453846
of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening	334.67791132315426
before it expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate	279.364784786276
object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human	218.81595426427148
creature in its final agonies. A dull and dismal light was shed over	214.89526239876142
the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young girl. All noise in	278.1012750513962
the streets had ceased, and the silence was frightful.	288.5447099322037
It was then that the door of Edward’s room opened, and a head we have	258.60856906742555
before noticed appeared in the glass opposite; it was Madame de	333.6270780535369
Villefort, who came to witness the effects of the drink she had	263.5615708786941
prepared. She stopped in the doorway, listened for a moment to the	221.59416928418625
flickering of the lamp, the only sound in that deserted room, and then	221.4685395256038
advanced to the table to see if Valentine’s glass were empty. It was	335.8878465532948
still about a quarter full, as we before stated. Madame de Villefort	291.10028987982594
emptied the contents into the ashes, which she disturbed that they	292.1939967696014
might the more readily absorb the liquid; then she carefully rinsed the	325.5075160289214
glass, and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the table.	234.5982372136317
If anyone could have looked into the room just then he would have	327.91361867369744
noticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the	178.6260297066589
bed and looked fixedly on Valentine. The dim light, the profound	292.3970224265852
silence, and the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more	230.03328911140417
by her own conscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the	343.2603511141088
poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own work.	178.8449442634951
At length she rallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the	352.45382824272133
pillow gazed intently on Valentine. The young girl no longer breathed,	299.50101680770655
no breath issued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no	229.8427263216781
longer quivered—the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the	228.4313749504878
long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax. Madame de Villefort	265.6717258004349
gazed upon the face so expressive even in its stillness; then she	370.9357394906817
ventured to raise the coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl’s	238.32114364488245
heart. It was cold and motionless. She only felt the pulsation in her	185.6099949377712
own fingers, and withdrew her hand with a shudder. One arm was hanging	269.3912561184295
out of the bed; from shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of	182.24388723872073
Germain Pillon’s “Graces,”23 but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly	239.25069698634098
distorted by convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was	216.23538293084985
resting with stiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed.	333.8287489231175
The nails, too, were turning blue.	225.06708882825268
Madame de Villefort had no longer any doubt; all was over—she had	232.17955947902715
consummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish. There was no	255.53108701198965
more to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though	196.16979631114614
fearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she	176.1485233992622
still held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction	311.3916023980696
always exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely	201.85839646088948
mysterious and does not excite disgust.	370.05503689643507
The minutes passed; Madame de Villefort could not drop the curtain	308.6939119872614
which she held like a funeral pall over the head of Valentine. She was	271.7973471817788
lost in reverie, and the reverie of crime is remorse.	238.43489967039903
Just then the lamp again flickered; the noise startled Madame de	219.53805576453476
Villefort, who shuddered and dropped the curtain. Immediately	311.1383639454197
afterwards the light expired, and the room was plunged in frightful	284.0233820162656
obscurity, while the clock at that minute struck half-past four.	276.25647551257805
Overpowered with agitation, the poisoner succeeded in groping her way	272.53706735163945
to the door, and reached her room in an agony of fear. The darkness	361.64336401529914
lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept through the	268.0015221805833
Venetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in the room.	269.7301014512462
About this time the nurse’s cough was heard on the stairs and the woman	338.7280986623016
entered the room with a cup in her hand. To the tender eye of a father	335.95409287685084
or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal Valentine’s	251.25799629227123
condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to sleep.	365.7628578650073
“Good,” she exclaimed, approaching the table, “she has taken part of	249.71393032573874
her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.”	205.96444934836927
Then she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she had	187.69847177205293
just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by	172.37106614233943
Valentine’s sleep, so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a	350.317062706884
little more rest. The clock striking eight awoke her. Astonished at the	351.5936474824366
prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm	231.1841525158682
was still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and	297.8956673530074
for the first time noticed the white lips. She tried to replace the	205.94978833246276
arm, but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a	339.3110670719788
sick-nurse. She screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed:	320.4796471673263
“Help, help!”	189.6369511567034
50083m	255.60841233372167
“What is the matter?” asked M. d’Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it	199.13211689916085
being the hour he usually visited her.	354.4650361118884
“What is it?” asked Villefort, rushing from his room. “Doctor, do you	262.4515371007865
hear them call for help?”	355.03370386031906
“Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine’s room.”	190.49351822254866
But before the doctor and the father could reach the room, the servants	311.1696537912962
who were on the same floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and	218.0930654078835
motionless on her bed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and	322.8494068502932
stood transfixed, as though struck by lightening.	305.2302558066051
“Call Madame de Villefort!—Wake Madame de Villefort!” cried the	361.65503805246436
procureur from the door of his chamber, which apparently he scarcely	192.05869701258044
dared to leave. But instead of obeying him, the servants stood watching	305.587552944265
M. d’Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised her in his arms.	228.5320233035597
“What?—this one, too?” he exclaimed. “Oh, where will be the end?”	303.25574896266573
Villefort rushed into the room.	212.58998076813128
“What are you saying, doctor?” he exclaimed, raising his hands to	201.87387619140668
heaven.	269.3410834564065
“I say that Valentine is dead!” replied d’Avrigny, in a voice terrible	179.85451328023797
in its solemn calmness.	190.16886230311852
50085m	238.71572827288819
M. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed. On the	306.18290028147123
exclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all	227.43221214934584
fled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the	172.37233755059583
stairs and through the long passages, then there was a rush in the	224.25649062013525
court, afterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the	261.59633962034883
accursed house.	250.66492910737992
Just then, Madame de Villefort, in the act of slipping on her	282.54944489841705
dressing-gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood	237.90557643658542
motionless, as though interrogating the occupants of the room, while	179.12863807657718
she endeavored to call up some rebellious tears. On a sudden she	259.49992552987237
stepped, or rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table.	223.63441045037916
She saw d’Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain	350.3605049739753
of having emptied during the night. It was now a third full, just as it	316.80195833301525
was when she threw the contents into the ashes. The spectre of	321.0661086804871
Valentine rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less. It	337.8914671172321
was, indeed, the same color as the draught she had poured into the	277.75650661816763
glass, and which Valentine had drunk; it was indeed the poison, which	306.80908759769363
could not deceive M. d’Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it	182.9136222241406
was doubtless a miracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her	182.03247513692912
precautions, there should be some trace, some proof remaining to reveal	274.75350900448484
the crime.	237.73186142273653
While Madame de Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of	298.2183239844219
terror, and Villefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw	356.83033158286565
nothing around him, d’Avrigny approached the window, that he might the	171.87082286033106
better examine the contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his	269.6335814415968
finger in, tasted it.	212.0120208861664
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “it is no longer brucine that is used; let me see	233.24541763967363
what it is!”	340.3032348110549
Then he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine’s room, which had been	345.4897689883607
transformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a	309.44711888367846
small bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor,	338.76322383597125
which immediately changed to a blood-red color.	206.60906539601388
“Ah,” exclaimed d’Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge	199.74922048995714
unveiling the truth was mingled with the delight of a student making a	331.8115388798649
discovery.	192.5220045518386
Madame de Villefort was overpowered; her eyes first flashed and then	278.2916503347634
swam, she staggered towards the door and disappeared. Directly	183.33556478913164
afterwards the distant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground	367.6966429629863
was heard, but no one paid any attention to it; the nurse was engaged	216.34631745040167
in watching the chemical analysis, and Villefort was still absorbed in	243.42731668761505
grief. M. d’Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his	308.39468429221307
eyes, and watched her hurried retreat. He lifted up the drapery over	281.58900602242136
the entrance to Edward’s room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de	277.3596049802343
Villefort’s apartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor.	240.44696005474447
“Go to the assistance of Madame de Villefort,” he said to the nurse.	242.22064586263787
“Madame de Villefort is ill.”	172.8326867952829
50087m	252.9715167609389
“But Mademoiselle de Villefort——” stammered the nurse.	359.33131662888775
“Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help,” said d’Avrigny,	286.01346116486644
“since she is dead.”	185.21759865841977
“Dead,—dead!” groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which	172.23266543678645
was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron	275.92964986633194
heart of that man.	330.1954685431365
“Dead!” repeated a third voice. “Who said Valentine was dead?”	241.5838955827494
The two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and	275.8757551285439
terror-stricken. This is what had happened. At the usual time, Morrel	174.11386391481915
had presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier’s room.	236.54696531328824
Contrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring	330.7100824004725
he entered. He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant	331.76205047056743
to conduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants	310.53585908160414
having, as we know, deserted the house. Morrel had no particular reason	231.568136477432
for uneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should	236.6177931838351
live, and so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the	229.41888018144917
count had given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by	271.98453954108135
Noirtier. Still this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and	343.6868766492152
he called a second and third time; still no answer. Then he determined	361.51322470010496
to go up. Noirtier’s room was opened, like all the rest. The first	312.92559679587214
thing he saw was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual	271.75902491148895
place, but his eyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor	263.60608248070287
which overspread his features.	219.48848774268333
“How are you, sir?” asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart.	359.66650692196765
“Well,” answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance	313.0901480075296
manifested increasing uneasiness.	303.3306040301873
“You are thoughtful, sir,” continued Morrel; “you want something; shall	335.558846673198
I call one of the servants?”	301.2880258709039
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.	282.45797289391834
Morrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one	245.34899212147536
answered. He turned towards Noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed	175.02037462792148
on his countenance momentarily increased.	196.14717868683968
“Oh,” exclaimed Morrel, “why do they not come? Is anyone ill in the	229.65300897137107
house?” The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from	352.3978117044375
their sockets. “What is the matter? You alarm me. Valentine?	338.1393965285656
Valentine?”	253.79845982391888
“Yes, yes,” signed Noirtier.	310.61182983124894
Maximilian tried to speak, but he could articulate nothing; he	269.8944053639109
staggered, and supported himself against the wainscot. Then he pointed	307.3946296324998
to the door.	189.5287497997871
“Yes, yes, yes!” continued the old man.	321.5189836236368
50089m	305.37721484726774
Maximilian rushed up the little staircase, while Noirtier’s eyes seemed	224.8456594444634
to say,—“Quicker, quicker!”	206.72211445159905
In a minute the young man darted through several rooms, till at length	231.99914753619225
he reached Valentine’s.	209.3544862928182
There was no occasion to push the door, it was wide open. A sob was the	247.255190691646
only sound he heard. He saw as though in a mist, a black figure	272.64316087909754
kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery. A terrible	284.420401816474
fear transfixed him. It was then he heard a voice exclaim “Valentine is	179.48924573409798
dead!” and another voice which, like an echo repeated:	336.6324273484713
“Dead,—dead!”	353.7257465201086
50090m	323.3471034645135
 Chapter 103. Maximilian	306.6492175749074
Villefort rose, half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of	279.6764794452513
grief. The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had	316.63115908594676
succeeded in making him more or less than man. His glance, at first	369.9406386711428
wandering, fixed itself upon Morrel. “Who are you, sir,” he asked,	212.41760318975673
“that forget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with	244.3796243548169
death? Go, sir, go!”	365.4346887835311
But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that	243.47760787358396
disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on	182.47647140585693
it.	319.520100563601
“Go!—do you hear?” said Villefort, while d’Avrigny advanced to lead	235.72008516467645
Morrel out. Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse, gazed all	281.3570074314226
around the room, then upon the two men; he opened his mouth to speak,	181.2887408297338
but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable ideas	255.03745438596536
that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his hands through his	340.2870192119018
hair in such a manner that Villefort and d’Avrigny, for a moment	205.6288418519847
diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances, which seemed to	270.0819762014921
say,—“He is mad!”	266.3563457376754
But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an	289.0346663108452
extraordinary weight. Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman	174.17111825483718
strength, the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs. When he reached	175.854592803984
the landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it	318.6298558995327
into Valentine’s room. This could only have been accomplished by means	310.8859234603409
of unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement. But the most	259.8509107332204
fearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face	253.4149238924145
expressing all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every	279.9710147379896
other faculty. That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort	322.1436668759263
like a frightful apparition. Each time he had been brought into contact	320.7457086952721
with his father, something terrible had happened.	212.8608703402817
“See what they have done!” cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the	297.9330494008965
back of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine. “See, my	241.73290722632294
father, see!”	182.58132821050495
Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,	268.56741541560723
almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father. At this moment	312.8433859111693
the whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became	332.2687244339551
bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples	346.58206275896214
became purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was	217.9215111267942
wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry. And the cry issued	212.57278698731582
from his pores, if we may thus speak—a cry frightful in its silence.	255.7291867578075
D’Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful	284.5695404043371
restorative.	203.8427555282849
“Sir,” cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, “they ask	272.36340538146624
me who I am, and what right I have to be here. Oh, you know it, tell	291.5232595789008
them, tell them!” And the young man’s voice was choked by sobs.	278.39388974780286
As for the old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. One	326.39946519363406
could have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death.	180.5580266072186
At length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping,	189.95226112312253
tears glistened in the eyes of Noirtier.	338.3963534120236
“Tell them,” said Morrel in a hoarse voice, “tell them that I am her	342.89013890475394
betrothed. Tell them she was my beloved, my noble girl, my only	328.531373180255
blessing in the world. Tell them—oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to	240.57794048683553
me!”	305.7481187011668
The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily on	199.71946949862624
his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive	301.01673134835414
energy. D’Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion,	340.8933192644979
turned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further explanation,	348.2829195000592
and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us	245.83728698277847
towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn, extended his	287.1933743081244
hand towards the young man.	253.5977468561495
But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the hand of Valentine, and	281.3294795212979
unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets. For	178.83361076841567
some time nothing was heard in that chamber but sobs, exclamations, and	252.96289302396713
prayers. At length Villefort, the most composed of all, spoke:	267.0240769060607
“Sir,” said he to Maximilian, “you say you loved Valentine, that you	294.7082595983468
were betrothed to her. I knew nothing of this engagement, of this love,	307.0142338213901
yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that your grief is real and	206.9005115125843
deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place	365.91079910016697
in my heart. But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left	188.70652109084426
this earth—she has nothing more to do with the adoration of men. Take a	307.39301824819245
last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take the hand you expected to	192.27258855283748
possess once more within your own, and then separate yourself from her	258.9132222754207
forever. Valentine now requires only the ministrations of the priest.”	359.36816604074704
50093m	355.6833714304164
“You are mistaken, sir,” exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on one knee,	368.3128515640003
his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt—“you	292.6078285807689
are mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest,	291.6118629116455
but an avenger. _You_, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; _I_ will	357.04170217664773
be the avenger.”	294.3086294472501
“What do you mean, sir?” asked Villefort, trembling at the new idea	235.3935428134007
inspired by the delirium of Morrel.	238.48766688955322
“I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned	231.46448610631546
sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.”	285.2755924756959
The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d’Avrigny approached.	289.20129620308006
“Gentlemen,” said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of	310.09153777641706
the witnesses to the scene, “I know what I am saying, and you know as	287.50482948868046
well as I do what I am about to say—Valentine has been assassinated!”	240.15644463650233
Villefort hung his head, d’Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said	203.02167753395526
“Yes” with his eyes.	297.9087634230723
“Now, sir,” continued Morrel, “in these days no one can disappear by	289.3998634922472
violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her	182.84281012890415
disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful, and adorable	261.5765999415976
creature like Valentine. Now, M. le Procureur du Roi,” said Morrel with	221.16718533215314
increasing vehemence, “no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is	346.16898804711235
your place to seek the assassin.”	215.51740596670123
The young man’s implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his	187.30196476966077
side, glanced from Noirtier to d’Avrigny. But instead of finding	206.82057814917604
sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and his father, he only saw an	236.10703450585328
expression as inflexible as that of Maximilian.	315.9817990465301
“Yes,” indicated the old man.	221.42118929073763
“Assuredly,” said d’Avrigny.	250.11405070423172
“Sir,” said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force	241.10799986720627
and his own emotion,—“sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes	359.32027314943775
here. I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed, but no one	224.1268326492716
assassinates.”	176.87726969971655
The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d’Avrigny prepared to	188.09221307497188
speak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence.	361.387969943375
“And I say that murders _are_ committed here,” said Morrel, whose	360.57396632638984
voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: “I	347.3006532233128
tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four months. I	350.89336676206665
tell you, Valentine’s life was attempted by poison four days ago,	279.73875128103714
though she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier. I tell you	188.65303277455683
that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time	306.6321429817282
it has succeeded. I tell you that you know these things as well as I	224.7995232346823
do, since this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a	218.5419569632723
friend.”	177.25840283083258
“Oh, you rave, sir,” exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape	346.31361155577815
the net in which he was taken.	185.52629299370017
50095m	331.3976552361967
“I rave?” said Morrel; “well, then, I appeal to M. d’Avrigny himself.	347.7223318941435
Ask him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of	303.7781411479165
this house on the night of Madame de Saint-Méran’s death. You thought	369.51270260190836
yourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the	184.47592610183312
fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of	216.46915549657675
Valentine.” Villefort and d’Avrigny exchanged looks.	313.0429536994376
“Yes, yes,” continued Morrel; “recall the scene, for the words you	280.64310457323637
thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.	341.00137039764746
Certainly, after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de	353.7413417556517
Villefort towards his own relations, I ought to have denounced him to	200.12219011239435
the authorities; then I should not have been an accomplice to thy	285.3631993233324
death, as I now am, sweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall	245.77765540487104
become the avenger. This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy	183.31100387258493
father abandon thee, Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall	348.04762173628
pursue the assassin.”	273.82409046274506
And this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the	254.14788734955874
vigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of	304.4980660358472
Morrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so	180.87053892125073
long rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on	356.89872028746333
his knees by the side of the bed.	333.29928863802854
Then d’Avrigny spoke. “And I, too,” he exclaimed in a low voice, “I	276.5937991720895
unite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at	276.2433451572083
the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.”	184.4304870399213
“Oh, merciful Heavens!” murmured Villefort. Morrel raised his head, and	210.53025660591942
reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural lustre,—	213.7044255190875
“Stay,” he said, “M. Noirtier wishes to speak.”	307.0935608760703
“Yes,” indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from	220.97631175388636
all his faculties being centred in his glance.	368.85900568716374
“Do you know the assassin?” asked Morrel.	289.02755814220365
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.	355.0506958194016
“And will you direct us?” exclaimed the young man. “Listen, M.	211.60222291470404
d’Avrigny, listen!”	309.3984846931513
Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which	340.9970047908834
had so often made Valentine happy, and thus fixed his attention. Then,	306.9498335037132
having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor on his own, he glanced	307.2344479514228
towards the door.	238.9842408783169
“Do you wish me to leave?” said Morrel, sadly.	295.6613073098731
“Yes,” replied Noirtier.	240.13537553905076
“Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!”	218.62051967699477
The old man’s eyes remained fixed on the door.	250.34713500605991
“May I, at least, return?” asked Morrel.	304.89202893878553
“Yes.”	304.6798861164901
“Must I leave alone?”	361.744188038021
“No.”	290.734761958673
“Whom am I to take with me? The procureur?”	303.70002359091876
“No.”	297.2839967404791
“The doctor?”	289.8588275670986
“Yes.”	249.37704676389092
“You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort?”	221.74986061212337
“Yes.”	187.293612511706
“But can he understand you?”	212.8338005656106
“Yes.”	224.17723773572254
“Oh,” said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the	278.7249196854372
inquiries were to be made by him alone,—“oh, be satisfied, I can	218.30350442354757
understand my father.” While uttering these words with this expression	311.8262612597214
of joy, his teeth clashed together violently.	284.77516100467193
D’Avrigny took the young man’s arm, and led him out of the room. A more	204.78942552061733
than deathlike silence then reigned in the house. At the end of a	253.81223707763567
quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort	220.26891279258854
appeared at the door of the apartment where d’Avrigny and Morrel had	258.3566742398259
been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the other in grief.	224.0194340764972
“You can come,” he said, and led them back to Noirtier.	245.42120425369905
Morrel looked attentively on Villefort. His face was livid, large drops	174.208799834143
rolled down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a	188.2978163478008
quill pen which he had torn to atoms.	226.12033944298514
“Gentlemen,” he said in a hoarse voice, “give me your word of honor	241.8104458364288
that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst	245.04952325449085
ourselves!” The two men drew back.	363.1267926411853
“I entreat you——” continued Villefort.	284.4643434746042
“But,” said Morrel, “the culprit—the murderer—the assassin.”	275.63699522553054
“Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,” said Villefort. “My	212.65051290048396
father has revealed the culprit’s name; my father thirsts for revenge	291.68523101868686
as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this	367.8046084510139
secret. Do you not, father?”	297.0033772380527
“Yes,” resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an exclamation of	261.4034594566515
horror and surprise to escape him.	194.4500156085487
“Oh, sir,” said Villefort, arresting Maximilian by the arm, “if my	213.87717189820023
father, the inflexible man, makes this request, it is because he knows,	296.36907362475574
be assured, that Valentine will be terribly revenged. Is it not so,	173.01375873064504
father?”	289.7172929797431
The old man made a sign in the affirmative. Villefort continued:	347.0386089319923
“He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him. Rest assured,	257.4001952123302
gentlemen, that within three days, in a less time than justice would	354.5632367289992
demand, the revenge I shall have taken for the murder of my child will	205.586163720851
be such as to make the boldest heart tremble;” and as he spoke these	290.3283972485673
words he ground his teeth, and grasped the old man’s senseless hand.	309.12809087690607
“Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?” asked Morrel, while	175.37680289878352
d’Avrigny looked inquiringly.	353.06853778940444
“Yes,” replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.	231.75606786611633
“Swear, then,” said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and	285.54530759990035
d’Avrigny, “swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave	283.3282480424276
me to avenge my child.”	369.87222067009
D’Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble “Yes,” but Morrel,	182.6254780299033
disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after having pressed the	322.7085771122213
cold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left, uttering a long,	293.4785019947259
deep groan of despair and anguish.	261.8148386074835
We have before stated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort	261.3837005815392
was therefore obliged to request M. d’Avrigny to superintend all the	245.15433755548992
arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a	310.74311741405387
death under such suspicious circumstances.	265.2261005822599
It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair	173.9579846636108
of Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort	319.47205732003306
retired to his study, and d’Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the	261.5453171088705
mayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who	328.67643123562976
is expressly named “the doctor of the dead.” M. Noirtier could not be	294.7912423601495
persuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.	225.5916849429815
d’Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate	344.84077759344393
closed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was	179.93488257479282
obliged to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the	306.35564736968564
courage to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore,	366.48118219917916
entered the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless,	345.15573571183563
and silent as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the	183.6536373232574
indifference of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the	333.35448710965954
dead; he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just	214.7894928687534
unclosed the lips.	327.0641783777543
“Alas,” said d’Avrigny, “she is indeed dead, poor child!”	310.26489148599364
50099m	248.85618945094728
“Yes,” answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had	258.2103726899054
raised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old	269.52201309975436
man’s eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to	241.55636059833216
behold his child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his	324.02058531630666
companion was dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of	281.62207684554454
the corpse in chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face,	233.8918113900439
which looked like that of a sleeping angel.	327.53757650839043
A tear, which appeared in the old man’s eye, expressed his thanks to	208.68296633694055
the doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner	359.03856260707585
of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by	329.18921148735734
d’Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his study; having in a few	225.25822277194908
words thanked the district doctor, he turned to d’Avrigny, and said:	280.26847244650287
“And now the priest.”	220.5073426627586
“Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?” asked	203.158933613832
d’Avrigny.	234.4555987906842
“No.” said Villefort; “fetch the nearest.”	367.24852809432974
“The nearest,” said the district doctor, “is a good Italian abbé, who	308.9814851978531
lives next door to you. Shall I call on him as I pass?”	298.7806508419996
“D’Avrigny,” said Villefort, “be so kind, I beseech you, as to	259.67199822720823
accompany this gentleman. Here is the key of the door, so that you can	180.45196829365523
go in and out as you please; you will bring the priest with you, and	331.1303642942702
will oblige me by introducing him into my child’s room.”	222.48554733733425
50101m	219.65677408546492
“Do you wish to see him?”	326.2831137649294
“I only wish to be alone. You will excuse me, will you not? A priest	245.9768458604807
can understand a father’s grief.”	263.43894265805585
And M. de Villefort, giving the key to d’Avrigny, again bade farewell	363.9858754408493
to the strange doctor, and retired to his study, where he began to	275.6511174249655
work. For some temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.	261.97117921745917
As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing	295.7712996930993
on the threshold of the next door.	351.28087003780513
“This is the abbé of whom I spoke,” said the doctor to d’Avrigny.	346.01815154925
D’Avrigny accosted the priest.	292.6347662496544
“Sir,” he said, “are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an	333.8521855679591
unhappy father who has just lost his daughter? I mean M. de Villefort,	370.03275941282254
the king’s attorney.”	197.41979026946143
“Ah,” said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; “yes, I have heard	241.19033501840272
that death is in that house.”	277.7955299147477
“Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.”	325.7510970220999
“I was about to offer myself, sir,” said the priest; “it is our mission	342.25510622723635
to forestall our duties.”	273.360850182753
“It is a young girl.”	178.67091516205844
“I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me. I	186.3366810573147
also know that her name is Valentine, and I have already prayed for	239.5229062975028
her.”	282.89606949537404
“Thank you, sir,” said d’Avrigny; “since you have commenced your sacred	319.077967510047
office, deign to continue it. Come and watch by the dead, and all the	365.7402639096633
wretched family will be grateful to you.”	363.2437434831465
“I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be	175.40955833444093
more fervent than mine.”	358.3619346690003
D’Avrigny took the priest’s hand, and without meeting Villefort, who	256.0117517378624
was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine’s room, which on the	365.56850639936056
following night was to be occupied by the undertakers. On entering the	347.44170743245866
room, Noirtier’s eyes met those of the abbé, and no doubt he read some	333.9347708991999
particular expression in them, for he remained in the room. D’Avrigny	359.04959520672384
recommended the attention of the priest to the living as well as to the	222.4913415038846
dead, and the abbé promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his	279.9972845457605
attentions to Noirtier.	179.00294852563687
In order, doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling	218.90616140939989
his sacred mission, the priest rose as soon as d’Avrigny departed, and	196.22170961482456
not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but	283.87683959380684
also that leading to Madame de Villefort’s room.	264.83680669483704
 Chapter 104. Danglars’ Signature	244.34969092828322
The next morning dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the	252.28337313257123
undertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the	246.01945033994406
corpse in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the	312.21023049253006
equality of death, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing	230.1763979657808
in life. This winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of	256.8213192438621
cambric, which the young girl had bought a fortnight before.	237.72886795271353
During the evening two men, engaged for the purpose, had carried	243.59427261936298
Noirtier from Valentine’s room into his own, and contrary to all	358.02533763201853
expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child.	319.5161201069316
The Abbé Busoni had watched till daylight, and then left without	174.88275211842705
calling anyone. D’Avrigny returned about eight o’clock in the morning;	333.6364459909332
he met Villefort on his way to Noirtier’s room, and accompanied him to	303.173036458788
see how the old man had slept. They found him in the large armchair,	304.1583391263906
which served him for a bed, enjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling	206.6580798480369
sleep. They both stood in amazement at the door.	188.48843753451402
“See,” said d’Avrigny to Villefort, “nature knows how to alleviate the	342.456268426407
deepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child,	222.48677384015357
and yet he sleeps.”	187.68469221670256
“Yes, you are right,” replied Villefort, surprised; “he sleeps, indeed!	293.68483002969083
And this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him	221.82821181736904
awake all night.”	330.7805114033973
“Grief has stunned him,” replied d’Avrigny; and they both returned	251.99751732960615
thoughtfully to the procureur’s study.	307.9966193096475
“See, I have not slept,” said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;	364.34219133202515
“grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for two nights; but	245.61038682654333
then look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and	310.62709572771007
nights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation	369.7170594026881
against the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,—my passion, my joy, my	351.72534526839326
delight,—it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!” and he convulsively	263.1929737329586
grasped the hand of d’Avrigny.	191.0932386507029
“Do you require my services now?” asked d’Avrigny.	196.91359072146574
“No,” said Villefort; “only return again at eleven o’clock; at twelve	287.6381688643961
the—the—oh, Heavens, my poor, poor child!” and the procureur again	227.3751180315631
becoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.	207.01517337454771
“Shall you be present in the reception-room?”	264.29134665078504
“No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall work,	357.2395207255474
doctor—when I work I forget everything.”	304.8261251994026
And, indeed, no sooner had the doctor left the room, than he was again	361.78719747988197
absorbed in work. On the doorsteps d’Avrigny met the cousin whom	285.5279734372518
Villefort had mentioned, a personage as insignificant in our story as	248.82655125761218
in the world he occupied—one of those beings designed from their birth	172.17447581698883
to make themselves useful to others. He was punctual, dressed in black,	336.4004617607944
with crape around his hat, and presented himself at his cousin’s with a	213.28125442192564
face made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be	250.76742947488094
required.	232.375768759295
At eleven o’clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and	300.1372878860013
the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers,	193.15522009432212
equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich,	359.3829758529264
and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the	202.30853533575095
marriage of a duchess.	183.08042519173364
Gradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made	309.7316672557056
their appearance—we mean Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp,	311.6743233411479
accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in	282.0670120834431
literature, or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first	331.0044829511769
Parisian circles, less owing to his social position than to his	227.56690904652112
personal merit.	302.2139029537459
The cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was	276.04921782284146
rather a relief to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as	276.18598023815525
themselves, and who did not exact a mournful face or force tears, as	267.79072812744937
would have been the case with a father, a brother, or a lover. Those	205.46816410847276
who were acquainted soon formed into little groups. One of them was	277.7320646588204
made of Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp.	189.26192709417109
“Poor girl,” said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute	255.3183300370161
to the sad event,—“poor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! Could	172.5777698865268
you have imagined this scene, Château-Renaud, when we saw her, at the	268.17048592351387
most three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?”	231.89751382585035
“Indeed, no,” said Château-Renaud.”	306.9482123114087
“Did you know her?”	247.9734248192367
“I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf’s, among the rest;	323.50642248775927
she appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is her	331.66803793851705
stepmother? Do you know?”	213.96557014963977
“She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is	186.0320333488992
receiving us.”	289.2300668631901
50105m	230.53898379758692
“Who is he?”	334.0174152761788
“Whom do you mean?”	227.490533930566
“The gentleman who receives us? Is he a deputy?”	268.7375056522172
“Oh, no. I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,” said	363.26245250975
Beauchamp; “but he is perfectly unknown to me.”	325.84515634287936
“Have you mentioned this death in your paper?”	243.82532526383346
“It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt if	253.8151344590155
it will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths	289.75616373902784
had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king’s attorney, he	213.9275122456415
would have interested himself somewhat more about it.”	306.0356276750373
“Still,” said Château-Renaud, “Dr. d’Avrigny, who attends my mother,	193.1667073394509
declares he is in despair about it. But whom are you seeking, Debray?”	316.28190280091417
“I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo” said the young man.	338.3701746761581
“I met him on the boulevard, on my way here,” said Beauchamp. “I think	195.20466720714504
he is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.”	348.81532266271574
“His banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?” asked Château-Renaud	292.03391290477697
of Debray.	249.8791855923729
“I believe so,” replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. “But	252.17824533232817
Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.”	370.40933482588036
“Morrel? Do they know him?” asked Château-Renaud. “I think he has only	190.40159925275697
been introduced to Madame de Villefort.”	327.2849804255286
“Still, he ought to have been here,” said Debray; “I wonder what will	178.60329337560924
be talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush,	321.950421413197
here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some	298.777985634807
little speech to the cousin,” and the three young men drew near to	314.6798360662847
listen.	254.3174513452147
Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he	278.43631941145395
had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la	340.6102379034803
Chaussée d’Antin, to M. Danglars’. The banker saw the carriage of the	300.46299754363554
count enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though	274.2418013621535
affable smile.	219.50375155598923
“Well,” said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, “I suppose you	216.8653571231875
have come to sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken	323.0016168013103
possession of my house. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself	239.62964129319116
whether I had not wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would	244.74250241357927
have justified the proverb of ‘He who wishes misfortunes to happen to	357.53075386179876
others experiences them himself.’ Well, on my word of honor, I	208.6603247256233
answered, ‘No!’ I wished no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud,	308.45303174792366
perhaps, for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all	273.75795139400475
have our faults. Do you know, count, that persons of our time of	239.51561330379724
life—not that you belong to the class, you are still a young man,—but	351.09862693412856
as I was saying, persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate	306.272937986231
this year. For example, look at the puritanical procureur, who has just	227.53653405574792
lost his daughter, and in fact nearly all his family, in so singular a	180.95478654447254
manner; Morcerf dishonored and dead; and then myself covered with	211.2803635346269
ridicule through the villany of Benedetto; besides——”	221.96608116627004
“Besides what?” asked the Count.	370.64664465391087
“Alas, do you not know?”	366.4129452657412
“What new calamity?”	287.38620589371556
“My daughter——”	337.1944115073027
“Mademoiselle Danglars?”	232.8932029403189
“Eugénie has left us!”	355.1367458870036
“Good heavens, what are you telling me?”	306.7920586245092
“The truth, my dear count. Oh, how happy you must be in not having	243.6523479327389
either wife or children!”	185.10051596385034
“Do you think so?”	316.9459237653308
“Indeed I do.”	252.96001860690274
“And so Mademoiselle Danglars——”	285.72359660867676
“She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she	296.42978519726177
asked permission to travel.”	177.42574234137174
“And is she gone?”	326.4397719385754
“The other night she left.”	258.3265194499053
“With Madame Danglars?”	240.78106944060784
“No, with a relation. But still, we have quite lost our dear Eugénie;	244.82020174753035
for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France.”	185.06158513150461
“Still, baron,” said Monte Cristo, “family griefs, or indeed any other	357.8317808168314
affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure,	171.84230290100916
are endurable to a millionaire. Philosophers may well say, and	290.46302018310917
practical men will always support the opinion, that money mitigates	224.7150024742051
many trials; and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm, you	315.93446530728926
ought to be very easily consoled—you, the king of finance, the focus of	180.3211613516945
immeasurable power.”	267.4950453255171
Danglars looked at him askance, as though to ascertain whether he spoke	171.33961578868693
seriously.	360.38618195315166
“Yes,” he answered, “if a fortune brings consolation, I ought to be	299.204525549074
consoled; I am rich.”	331.60613373160965
“So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you	325.4430111438762
wished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you	264.36670711427445
would not dare!”	343.5524289649926
Danglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the count. “That	247.64431478350275
reminds me,” he said, “that when you entered I was on the point of	346.56757108299905
signing five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you allow me	258.9731001481224
to do the same to the others?”	226.6572335581583
“Pray do so.”	245.21541725723063
There was a moment’s silence, during which the noise of the banker’s	256.4840006967197
pen was alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on	275.4975315303057
the ceiling.	245.37874445858915
“Are they Spanish, Haitian, or Neapolitan bonds?” said Monte Cristo.	198.30412157666774
“No,” said Danglars, smiling, “they are bonds on the bank of France,	266.3051727581758
payable to bearer. Stay, count,” he added, “you, who may be called the	327.7279289339947
emperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you many pieces	319.04241998559235
of paper of this size, each worth a million?”	279.96483711594055
The count took into his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly	239.26061202816862
presented to him, and read:—	328.47985241212393
“‘To the Governor of the Bank. Please pay to my order, from the fund	208.6066520484181
deposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my	315.4335861795902
account.	296.4005276087639
“Baron Danglars.’”	317.75155088514225
“One, two, three, four, five,” said Monte Cristo; “five millions—why	306.41654248605835
what a Crœsus you are!”	208.39853076870043
“This is how I transact business,” said Danglars.	360.26259539464917
“It is really wonderful,” said the count; “above all, if, as I suppose,	340.65990366534345
it is payable at sight.”	285.1600559637285
“It is, indeed,” said Danglars.	345.01686135868556
“It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in France	183.13142933696997
these things are done. Five millions on five little scraps of paper!—it	328.02023165591993
must be seen to be believed.”	369.11779027927713
“You do not doubt it?”	366.317318691158
“No!”	253.98238733676823
“You say so with an accent—stay, you shall be convinced; take my clerk	331.04966734245113
to the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the	184.40339410852854
Treasury for the same sum.”	252.84371697017724
“No,” said Monte Cristo folding the five notes, “most decidedly not;	344.5929356642939
the thing is so curious, I will make the experiment myself. I am	232.1425146225734
credited on you for six millions. I have drawn nine hundred thousand	289.6632327995876
francs, you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand	257.1561384357691
francs. I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds,	326.45853420714445
with your signature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the six	332.90844626039086
millions between us. I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in	171.90202975687515
want of money today.”	208.02133618029336
And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand, while	272.88083848758174
with the other he held out the receipt to Danglars. If a thunderbolt	205.76430004160738
had fallen at the banker’s feet, he could not have experienced greater	349.0218451377583
terror.	179.167882524103
“What,” he stammered, “do you mean to keep that money? Excuse me,	179.13126058416805
excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,—a deposit which I	239.28828365475545
promised to pay this morning.”	318.1917795090826
“Oh, well, then,” said Monte Cristo, “I am not particular about these	289.5878134777387
five notes, pay me in a different form; I wished, from curiosity, to	348.25765076621224
take these, that I might be able to say that without any advice or	350.4324667935334
preparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a	195.3475293472424
minute’s delay; it would have been remarkable. But here are your bonds;	242.52956689181678
pay me differently;” and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized	248.13283728831976
them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is	293.9011887121175
being wrested from its grasp.	332.35498113417617
Suddenly he rallied, made a violent effort to restrain himself, and	348.40435595304126
then a smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed	235.5595735450445
countenance.	338.22086169581314
50109m	344.19444287889695
“Certainly,” he said, “your receipt is money.”	299.56571074993667
“Oh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson & French	186.4939458013422
would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than	344.9610952078
you have just done.”	365.09640444470324
“Pardon me, count, pardon me.”	307.2256150616806
“Then I may keep this money?”	218.05283979871362
“Yes,” said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of	171.37227022721183
his hair. “Yes, keep it—keep it.”	225.59506000239992
Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable	299.5967022342585
expression which seemed to say, “Come, reflect; if you repent there is	193.2639488924343
still time.”	245.69915343437577
“No,” said Danglars, “no, decidedly no; keep my signatures. But you	295.4497042297315
know none are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended	336.79648674543074
this money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I	285.51777837268645
did not pay them with these precise bonds. How absurd—as if one crown	241.33876652003536
were not as good as another. Excuse me;” and he began to laugh loudly,	350.1229129911012
but nervously.	180.92391233797457
“Certainly, I excuse you,” said Monte Cristo graciously, “and pocket	269.55218944965316
them.” And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.	250.69699597834028
“But,” said Danglars, “there is still a sum of one hundred thousand	340.2137679957874
francs?”	281.686380601202
“Oh, a mere nothing,” said Monte Cristo. “The balance would come to	339.0849878260708
about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits.”	202.62436735646628
“Count,” said Danglars, “are you speaking seriously?”	188.78471770479948
“I never joke with bankers,” said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner,	307.54014434209546
which repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as the	306.3954196216309
valet de chambre announced:	266.3730874303742
“M. de Boville, Receiver-General of the charities.”	239.7800149160033
“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo; “I think I arrived just in time to	224.41710222371117
obtain your signatures, or they would have been disputed with me.”	368.6462418641065
Danglars again became pale, and hastened to conduct the count out.	314.56310753156606
Monte Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville, who was	218.19956340036236
standing in the waiting-room, and who was introduced into Danglars’	341.6228377024172
room as soon as the count had left.	290.05653332535286
The count’s serious face was illumined by a faint smile, as he noticed	285.27944207159044
the portfolio which the receiver-general held in his hand. At the door	198.95885513733126
he found his carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank.	255.67229982509141
Meanwhile Danglars, repressing all emotion, advanced to meet the	210.88140936786084
receiver-general. We need not say that a smile of condescension was	287.0912383699272
stamped upon his lips.	292.5853487127136
“Good-morning, creditor,” said he; “for I wager anything it is the	267.9392236623267
creditor who visits me.”	260.6796634386388
“You are right, baron,” answered M. de Boville; “the charities present	205.82326088839608
themselves to you through me; the widows and orphans depute me to	215.2404468975522
receive alms to the amount of five millions from you.”	269.9613326258503
“And yet they say orphans are to be pitied,” said Danglars, wishing to	367.6554719550926
prolong the jest. “Poor things!”	319.5780533715682
“Here I am in their name,” said M. de Boville; “but did you receive my	320.28829208886077
letter yesterday?”	233.80892929939563
“Yes.”	234.13225147320588
“I have brought my receipt.”	199.4492897643547
50111m	213.93331014508001
“My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by	229.3930949483632
waiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw	280.31591372707067
leaving here—you did see him, I think?”	335.2891662501088
“Yes; well?”	189.0497649793473
“Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions.”	307.33713272930817
“How so?”	224.02445734462898
“The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by Thomson	316.27711033010985
& French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once, which I	252.01753679004835
paid him with checks on the bank. My funds are deposited there, and you	173.66180605699913
can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will	223.16626894172265
appear rather strange to the governor. Two days will be a different	292.57557674691026
thing,” said Danglars, smiling.	258.4904441632963
“Come,” said Boville, with a tone of entire incredulity, “five millions	329.9915236841556
to that gentleman who just left, and who bowed to me as though he knew	362.2651980135581
me?”	301.9343071950808
“Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte Cristo	293.19862014667194
knows everybody.”	233.43154638991584
“Five millions!”	209.94169790518094
“Here is his receipt. Believe your own eyes.” M. de Boville took the	289.62377667772535
paper Danglars presented him, and read:	332.94770809392406
“Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred	296.5842775118024
thousand francs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson &	308.45584752430494
French of Rome.”	288.99548354143747
“It is really true,” said M. de Boville.	292.6431364035348
“Do you know the house of Thomson & French?”	243.48217588693274
“Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000	205.2097985726424
francs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned.”	331.11092498224
“It is one of the best houses in Europe,” said Danglars, carelessly	270.49288566987923
throwing down the receipt on his desk.	328.9850711673397
“And he had five millions in your hands alone! Why, this Count of Monte	227.68360757645394
Cristo must be a nabob?”	353.58552432414103
“Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits—one on	282.7880967781938
me, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see,” he added	252.9922002895923
carelessly, “he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance of	365.6483648769938
100,000 francs.”	203.71326389464178
M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration.	239.56097216301063
“I must visit him,” he said, “and obtain some pious grant from him.”	238.23059596256826
“Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000	210.51445030559086
francs a month.”	205.4923910847911
“It is magnificent! I will set before him the example of Madame de	225.4920257651226
Morcerf and her son.”	308.49462186902355
“What example?”	236.76675484942706
“They gave all their fortune to the hospitals.”	362.2176266016555
“What fortune?”	247.4724673004015
“Their own—M. de Morcerf’s, who is deceased.”	234.490330081201
“For what reason?”	261.9704816530065
“Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired.”	351.51702370572696
“And what are they to live upon?”	195.07933401770833
“The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.”	269.87728622851034
50113m	361.3466823559871
“Well, I must confess, these are scruples.”	283.1646809589833
“I registered their deed of gift yesterday.”	193.57263981089807
“And how much did they possess?”	348.58758375865887
“Oh, not much—from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs. But to	366.1249839942717
return to our millions.”	308.6050956019807
“Certainly,” said Danglars, in the most natural tone in the world. “Are	347.09889935909337
you then pressed for this money?”	353.9272682143762
“Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow.”	290.88377522012513
“Tomorrow? Why did you not tell me so before? Why, it is as good as a	192.33839692202818
century! At what hour does the examination take place?”	308.63212354516065
“At two o’clock.”	265.72813420319966
“Send at twelve,” said Danglars, smiling.	349.89269385602796
M. de Boville said nothing, but nodded his head, and took up the	288.6085444764392
portfolio.	171.77097854236789
“Now I think of it, you can do better,” said Danglars.	353.00780573647336
“How do you mean?”	228.90683970861517
“The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to	341.35295598124503
Rothschild’s or Lafitte’s, and they will take it off your hands at	346.30475985993087
once.”	224.71612218577818
“What, though payable at Rome?”	178.6914924816025
“Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.”	319.148537412112
The receiver started back.	277.44690780510143
“_Ma foi!_” he said, “I prefer waiting till tomorrow. What a	367.8931188193115
proposition!”	177.2390403625003
“I thought, perhaps,” said Danglars with supreme impertinence, “that	234.29650442353568
you had a deficiency to make up?”	325.61140282191525
“Indeed,” said the receiver.	252.56297634939298
“And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some	274.72669207727915
sacrifice.”	311.07622070609006
“Thank you, no, sir.”	257.28831515385116
“Then it will be tomorrow.”	337.14791478016525
“Yes; but without fail.”	297.88562773701096
“Ah, you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank	213.31835206823186
shall be notified.”	188.50625328557828
“I will come myself.”	197.99813756262387
“Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.”	205.11429482802566
They shook hands.	198.09049837230853
“By the way,” said M. de Boville, “are you not going to the funeral of	201.6233463251363
poor Mademoiselle de Villefort, which I met on my road here?”	331.8802514654565
“No,” said the banker; “I have appeared rather ridiculous since that	207.05486103931713
affair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background.”	228.18169249023887
“Bah, you are wrong. How were you to blame in that affair?”	179.22561678004763
“Listen—when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is rather	287.2144530667273
sensitive.”	269.40644131607877
“Everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, Mademoiselle Danglars!”	248.87421240738604
“Poor Eugénie!” said Danglars; “do you know she is going to embrace a	242.39961453948962
religious life?”	349.438185064099
“No.”	242.54390830261298
“Alas, it is unhappily but too true. The day after the event, she	303.0561343667581
decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone	352.4209926880425
to seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.”	289.8293396852253
“Oh, it is terrible!” and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation,	172.26890655051145
after expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had scarcely	271.4783283521073
left before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone	316.53182004816165
understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frédérick,24	338.30996697302646
exclaimed:	186.11910828169385
“Fool!”	363.725020678432
Then enclosing Monte Cristo’s receipt in a little pocket-book, he	366.22180042333355
added:—“Yes, come at twelve o’clock; I shall then be far away.”	329.07591472563877
Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected	306.9883306498774
about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several papers, left	196.65903728537447
others exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter which he	227.78186947684804
addressed:	256.58953337067055
“To Madame la Baronne Danglars.”	318.9719393351299
“I will place it on her table myself tonight,” he murmured. Then taking	323.8757839329636
a passport from his drawer he said,—“Good, it is available for two	296.7847162319591
months longer.”	284.82937520381364
 Chapter 105. The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise	321.7397171070846
M. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking	209.32669370927974
Valentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a	368.91169236094225
cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the	345.2207985063327
trees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards.	184.47294867671476
M. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of	175.66517641009827
Père-Lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a	288.1745911843451
Parisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be	246.66456995098667
surrounded by worthy associates. He had therefore purchased a vault,	177.88423058920654
which was quickly occupied by members of his family. On the front of	191.6289043716975
the monument was inscribed: “The families of Saint-Méran and	182.59024761475007
Villefort,” for such had been the last wish expressed by poor Renée,	212.25124972407596
Valentine’s mother. The pompous procession therefore wended its way	258.35471432017795
towards Père-Lachaise from the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Having crossed	225.47363599702905
Paris, it passed through the Faubourg du Temple, then leaving the	253.15729844107884
exterior boulevards, it reached the cemetery. More than fifty private	223.89404794288825
carriages followed the twenty mourning-coaches, and behind them more	266.16276456280275
than five hundred persons joined in the procession on foot.	356.23105306322157
50117m	203.12602155533497
These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine’s death had	344.97101097262095
struck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness	315.1667594261073
of the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the	369.5686165394537
memory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the	347.97637203327326
flower of her youth.	211.31419379204152
As they left Paris, an equipage with four horses, at full speed, was	180.72117755709857
seen to draw up suddenly; it contained Monte Cristo. The count left the	223.67593017096613
carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on foot. Château-Renaud	302.52387246097317
perceived him and immediately alighting from his _coupé_, joined him;	182.9657703617703
Beauchamp did the same.	195.80368112475068
The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was	171.93831827527364
evidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment.	183.06513546949756
50119m	327.4117150978699
“Where is Morrel?” he asked; “do either of these gentlemen know where	328.469137503713
he is?”	296.7417732684696
“We have already asked that question,” said Château-Renaud, “for none	349.8960564408251
of us has seen him.”	171.00714903297978
The count was silent, but continued to gaze around him. At length they	181.089317899829
arrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced	301.87717880743116
through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon relieved from all	344.1953151827841
anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo	260.5017171078566
recognized him whom he sought.	230.88057685102675
One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent	194.6481906628931
metropolis. Black figures are seen scattered over the long white	310.5241349978473
avenues; the silence of earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise	358.78832502100664
made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments;	183.68033352995317
then follows the melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then	354.00921043921466
with a sob of anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass	292.43617876082226
of flowers.	331.6178263359044
The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of	339.76579905842226
Abélard and Héloïse, placed itself close to the heads of the horses	176.48788318392644
belonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker’s men, arrived	196.82586290699064
with them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person’s attention	342.28763146856954
was occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one	171.00794695654227
else observed. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object	328.17676324323577
of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the	331.2078559005
procession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with his	248.48485942493977
coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively	315.8443442275833
crushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated	191.07006667874964
on an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral	177.19021853175556
details could escape his observation.	192.03543426987684
Everything was conducted in the usual manner. A few men, the least	339.9781605785398
impressed of all by the scene, pronounced a discourse, some deploring	206.26497502965145
this premature death, others expatiating on the grief of the father,	353.44261267529083
and one very ingenious person quoting the fact that Valentine had	261.59904658948494
solicited pardon of her father for criminals on whom the arm of justice	197.03628598017366
was ready to fall—until at length they exhausted their stores of	186.889511841022
metaphor and mournful speeches, elaborate variations on the stanzas of	366.88469076098073
Malherbe to Du Périer.	287.0185549804044
Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose	280.93126698926335
calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in	216.56253119801207
his heart.	258.4744646543432
“See,” said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. “What is he doing	294.2889181200586
up there?” And they called Château-Renaud’s attention to him.	248.60774161707556
“How pale he is!” said Château-Renaud, shuddering.	299.44847054587797
“He is cold,” said Debray.	302.84454391125155
“Not at all,” said Château-Renaud, slowly; “I think he is violently	364.7840114468105
agitated. He is very susceptible.”	314.5531814915186
“Bah,” said Debray; “he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort; you	201.9254724730461
said so yourself.”	190.56183841430095
“True. Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de	329.9182620136572
Morcerf’s. Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced such	324.9423497155824
an effect?”	294.21522496554405
50121m	265.44369555851966
“No, I do not,” replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of what or	356.0997147550029
to whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching Morrel,	314.24928351328305
who was holding his breath with emotion.	282.3783366944375
“The discourse is over; farewell, gentlemen,” said the count,	347.31335321410967
unceremoniously.	218.17415223589825
And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went.	282.54654326252125
The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris. Château-Renaud	356.36190219460616
looked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were watching the	247.2089956310989
departure of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and	226.0099137204937
Château-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp.	320.64923335036286
Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the	264.3743502704041
arrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by	236.44319308723985
spectators and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it	284.2588185240182
reached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet	213.2840152473281
nearer, still unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with	210.32253060069584
outstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to	277.0049860801474
pounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till	274.2043564695292
it touched the stone, then clutching the grating with both hands, he	311.09357061076673
murmured:	305.863207091096
“Oh, Valentine!”	275.71835898788777
The count’s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he	202.47626025331186
stepped forward, and touching the young man’s shoulder, said:	218.27341590388116
“I was looking for you, my friend.” Monte Cristo expected a burst of	298.5240523139264
passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning round, said calmly,—	260.9986388716454
“You see I was praying.” The scrutinizing glance of the count searched	186.46740828695235
the young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy.	225.86977621839503
“Shall I drive you back to Paris?” he asked.	295.2620271313016
“No, thank you.”	183.99571857804065
“Do you wish anything?”	325.1218108475623
“Leave me to pray.”	313.0960056450897
The count withdrew without opposition, but it was only to place himself	198.72539296664428
in a situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel, who at	247.66719448579028
length arose, brushed the dust from his knees, and turned towards	288.21677718529213
Paris, without once looking back. He walked slowly down the Rue de la	176.00527409842056
Roquette. The count, dismissing his carriage, followed him about a	302.91146430655897
hundred paces behind. Maximilian crossed the canal and entered the Rue	180.20571937867626
Meslay by the boulevards.	359.84410293886833
Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrel’s entrance, it	238.08483041783063
was again opened for the count. Julie was at the entrance of the	360.06298362031924
garden, where she was attentively watching Penelon, who, entering with	268.86424866530683
zeal into his profession of gardener, was very busy grafting some	296.5732764824845
Bengal roses. “Ah, count,” she exclaimed, with the delight manifested	319.4546027478997
by every member of the family whenever he visited the Rue Meslay.	324.3040903958023
“Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?” asked the count.	210.7188098186319
50123m	264.53799705756853
“Yes, I think I saw him pass; but pray, call Emmanuel.”	286.14330059196004
“Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian’s room this	309.1468524972404
instant,” replied Monte Cristo, “I have something of the greatest	226.32405944128917
importance to tell him.”	343.7983431214054
“Go, then,” she said with a charming smile, which accompanied him until	349.52870351884366
he had disappeared.	258.1192959926893
Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor	240.30786258773156
to Maximilian’s room; when he reached the landing he listened	255.27390598846205
attentively, but all was still. Like many old houses occupied by a	357.0227707968847
single family, the room door was panelled with glass; but it was	274.61178754879575
locked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was impossible to see what was	190.84039092682724
passing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn before the glass.	323.90558376260094
The count’s anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom	358.257003516397
appeared on the face of that imperturbable man.	359.8279595953887
“What shall I do!” he uttered, and reflected for a moment; “shall I	254.81606034173632
ring? No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will but	282.20419800690826
accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilian’s situation, and then	273.4920978680801
the bell would be followed by a louder noise.”	351.7870194125068
Monte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had	302.68805557855694
been taken with the rapidity of lightning, he struck one of the panes	368.76610322235786
of glass with his elbow; the glass was shivered to atoms, then	258.261940879654
withdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel, who had been writing at his	284.6672003719186
desk, bound from his seat at the noise of the broken window.	368.9169425536692
“I beg a thousand pardons,” said the count, “there is nothing the	218.82489845561207
matter, but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with my	285.1140026748481
elbow. Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to enter your	244.72268038821875
room; do not disturb yourself—do not disturb yourself!”	270.18897150985515
And passing his hand through the broken glass, the count opened the	241.45523173447614
door. Morrel, evidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less	292.4967100009801
with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry.	281.57532381067705
“_Ma foi_,” said Monte Cristo, rubbing his elbow, “it’s all your	209.7738706527397
servant’s fault; your stairs are so polished, it is like walking on	253.13082843347857
glass.”	343.6730404512867
“Are you hurt, sir?” coldly asked Morrel.	209.2792578185842
“I believe not. But what are you about there? You were writing.”	240.7626668544641
“I?”	364.83214016341367
“Your fingers are stained with ink.”	192.38016609076016
“Ah, true, I was writing. I do sometimes, soldier though I am.”	171.71141111955083
Monte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him	273.1457738936973
pass, but he followed him.	314.27266496659627
“You were writing?” said Monte Cristo with a searching look.	239.38615324058986
“I have already had the honor of telling you I was,” said Morrel.	261.7781999294948
The count looked around him.	289.3027642322344
“Your pistols are beside your desk,” said Monte Cristo, pointing with	362.7908358863684
his finger to the pistols on the table.	354.8856786742363
“I am on the point of starting on a journey,” replied Morrel	222.2387709004627
disdainfully.	297.3249749610651
“My friend,” exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness.	246.8076285584299
“Sir?”	307.78390236269024
“My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I	368.6867204579188
entreat you.”	280.96950476197117
“I make a hasty resolution?” said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; “is	360.9086444788921
there anything extraordinary in a journey?”	303.7221635807078
50125m	279.53952339257455
“Maximilian,” said the count, “let us both lay aside the mask we have	331.3744796862112
assumed. You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose	347.15920907513055
upon you with my frivolous solicitude. You can understand, can you not,	209.19397140638577
that to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to have	194.46758062552857
intruded on the solitude of a friend—you can understand that, to have	250.120108994029
done all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or rather	326.8659480201154
by a terrible conviction. Morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!”	266.5879683329507
“Indeed, count,” said Morrel, shuddering; “what has put this into your	199.04929354465847
head?”	335.0385520574701
“I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,” continued the	259.52653511355174
count, “and here is proof of what I say;” and, approaching the desk, he	357.89134032501215
removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he	232.8541248058179
had begun, and took the latter in his hands.	230.19361503445703
Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving	175.69774357062272
his intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp.	329.0093027931374
“You wish to destroy yourself,” said the count; “you have written it.”	195.8419091283257
“Well,” said Morrel, changing his expression of calmness for one of	330.7917561270607
violence—“well, and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself,	171.07969430768316
who shall prevent me—who will dare prevent me? All my hopes are	222.9522987204377
blighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything around me is	193.9684868446098
sad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and human voices	276.09628522631215
distract me. It is a mercy to let me die, for if I live I shall lose my	345.04676726010416
reason and become mad. When, sir, I tell you all this with tears of	325.4846176132644
heartfelt anguish, can you reply that I am wrong, can you prevent my	313.08552573223136
putting an end to my miserable existence? Tell me, sir, could you have	194.8632062398949
the courage to do so?”	340.3855005781764
“Yes, Morrel,” said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted	245.31490128114714
strangely with the young man’s excitement; “yes, I would do so.”	305.38153580296455
“You?” exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach—“you, who	175.69603771239042
have deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with	337.0122455391389
vain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have seen	172.98309708363388
her die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand everything, even the	196.22418832668416
hidden sources of knowledge,—and who enact the part of a guardian angel	361.8229806323237
upon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison	255.79332770165547
administered to a young girl! Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with	370.90260052559506
pity, were you not hateful in my eyes.”	356.8516717772093
“Morrel——”	188.79423443143222
“Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be	235.6748345446074
satisfied! When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you—my	189.50690544413516
heart was softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But	270.52132109183566
since you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture	239.9540947498312
after I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo	328.8109312819205
my pretended benefactor—then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal	295.3297276020079
guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;”	190.04312456894215
and Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.	285.1568552808103
“And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.”	280.64228317435527
“Prevent me, then!” replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like	190.35424966451612
the first, failed in releasing him from the count’s iron grasp.	335.23338890838113
“I will prevent you.”	305.4303364628873
50127m	197.0294657951734
“And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right	325.43956784819215
over free and rational beings?”	319.7363674560097
“Who am I?” repeated Monte Cristo. “Listen; I am the only man in the	361.309858972196
world having the right to say to you, ‘Morrel, your father’s son shall	226.1691692527613
not die today;’” and Monte Cristo, with an expression of majesty and	270.803344070712
sublimity, advanced with arms folded toward the young man, who,	221.9638131049324
involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man, recoiled a	223.7549463252614
step.	180.2239340281941
“Why do you mention my father?” stammered he; “why do you mingle a	250.58448892745008
recollection of him with the affairs of today?”	325.414645671216
“Because I am he who saved your father’s life when he wished to destroy	301.12534153586193
himself, as you do today—because I am the man who sent the purse to	330.3352759478988
your young sister, and the _Pharaon_ to old Morrel—because I am the	337.9264256771904
Edmond Dantès who nursed you, a child, on my knees.”	213.552578190892
Morrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then	281.2833147538243
all his strength give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte	194.77036840713828
Cristo. Then his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden	304.9583913040974
revulsion; he arose, rushed out of the room and to the stairs,	213.37311002000092
exclaiming energetically, “Julie, Julie—Emmanuel, Emmanuel!”	313.0710496329723
Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died	279.9382342646088
rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed	284.2488321757142
upon the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in	282.2591419803852
alarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands,	277.7805093820161
and opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs:	295.5985769034339
“On your knees—on your knees—he is our benefactor—the saviour of our	245.4402384293524
father! He is——”	274.8532657037394
He would have added “Edmond Dantès,” but the count seized his arm and	340.12679851691536
prevented him.	355.2107932849674
Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel embraced him	192.3048556352055
as a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and struck the	307.3749199121145
ground with his forehead. Then the iron-hearted man felt his heart	254.210253225392
swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his	324.6352173478501
eyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the	295.5333428445364
room but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful	358.1929478478507
hearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep	273.62704690406827
emotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor,	300.2148629309986
ran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal	248.27365653078894
globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Allées de	277.9036638338691
Meilhan. Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count:	234.82141799260503
“Oh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown	221.8844909225028
benefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his	359.9345185406406
memory,—how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to	349.9484258581377
us? Oh, it was cruel to us, and—dare I say it?—to you also.”	370.42668519732
“Listen, my friends,” said the count—“I may call you so since we have	211.92253876881978
really been friends for the last eleven years—the discovery of this	238.54282433334544
secret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.	319.460015226026
I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom, but your	334.2698413496844
brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now,	341.2043026785171
I am sure.”	204.5617847385422
Then turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees, had	356.10919582253837
thrown himself into an armchair, he added in a low voice, pressing	311.43134839527295
Emmanuel’s hand significantly, “Watch over him.”	277.525187651163
“Why so?” asked the young man, surprised.	289.1266456096504
“I cannot explain myself; but watch over him.” Emmanuel looked around	324.93362601651495
the room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the	281.03924997064235
weapons, and he pointed to them. Monte Cristo bent his head. Emmanuel	365.1566126775499
went towards the pistols.	294.79150926036255
“Leave them,” said Monte Cristo. Then walking towards Morrel, he took	345.0176324102039
his hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a	359.73196722227806
profound stupor. Julie returned, holding the silken purse in her hands,	328.3075354291585
while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks, like dewdrops on the rose.	335.9597857178155
“Here is the relic,” she said; “do not think it will be less dear to us	300.3288809425561
now we are acquainted with our benefactor!”	190.9985407367959
“My child,” said Monte Cristo, coloring, “allow me to take back that	347.58442459507546
purse? Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered alone	177.67412241764654
through the affection I hope you will grant me.	172.66177124715128
“Oh,” said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, “no, no, I beseech	311.5115289086558
you do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us, will you	199.91797382265293
not?”	194.26940539361024
“You have guessed rightly, madame,” replied Monte Cristo, smiling; “in	271.73842076744756
a week I shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit	368.1694469382774
the vengeance of Heaven lived happily, while my father perished of	172.78983763327528
hunger and grief.”	302.01741846625157
While announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on Morrel, and	217.3744693488602
remarked that the words, “I shall have left this country,” had failed	196.4623894032859
to rouse him from his lethargy. He then saw that he must make another	333.5646379109658
struggle against the grief of his friend, and taking the hands of	222.13424600519164
Emmanuel and Julie, which he pressed within his own, he said with the	250.36584731048237
mild authority of a father:	306.08414204789426
“My kind friends, leave me alone with Maximilian.”	348.6376790358669
Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic, which	359.18444041955047
Monte Cristo had forgotten. She drew her husband to the door. “Let us	229.27197316666008
leave them,” she said.	212.18638528231844
The count was alone with Morrel, who remained motionless as a statue.	323.3153144298992
“Come,” said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his finger, “are	313.7292618962807
you a man again, Maximilian?”	266.1457478666574
“Yes; for I begin to suffer again.”	297.0457467189451
The count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.	232.26100569401297
“Maximilian, Maximilian,” he said, “the ideas you yield to are unworthy	316.30966184553097
of a Christian.”	297.7530272493843
“Oh, do not fear, my friend,” said Morrel, raising his head, and	225.94873788421324
smiling with a sweet expression on the count; “I shall no longer	207.50347654025285
attempt my life.”	272.7672490307674
“Then we are to have no more pistols—no more despair?”	232.4765228929823
“No; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or	254.786304280093
a knife.”	357.6467116473998
“Poor fellow, what is it?”	344.7234534816523
“My grief will kill me of itself.”	334.76263182268036
“My friend,” said Monte Cristo, with an expression of melancholy equal	206.48167594958065
to his own, “listen to me. One day, in a moment of despair like yours,	181.43580329837158
since it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one	231.72731453860814
day your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too. If	218.42609935322812
anyone had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to	274.3403187754534
his head—if anyone had told me, when in my prison I pushed back the	333.84512556959345
food I had not tasted for three days—if anyone had said to either of us	258.3384403348062
then, ‘Live—the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless	314.4595567884943
life!’—no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with	257.6440622378501
the smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,—and yet how many	193.3891938321
times has your father blessed life while embracing you—how often have I	296.4270387578013
myself——”	348.95952530878867
“Ah,” exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, “you had only lost your	287.14053384773933
liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost	191.25964821504334
Valentine.”	198.36444530682505
“Look at me,” said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes	264.5727695120037
made him so eloquent and persuasive—“look at me. There are no tears in	334.3887251421969
my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer—you,	209.54197660240555
Maximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does not this tell you	305.8320303825594
that in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to	342.20889460219485
beyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in the	226.87757422569805
conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your	183.6359994481809
life.”	289.91201493287184
“Oh, heavens,” said the young man, “oh, heavens—what are you saying,	277.24627461271683
count? Take care. But perhaps you have never loved!”	205.8732023805838
“Child!” replied the count.	287.4706881848669
“I mean, as I love. You see, I have been a soldier ever since I	284.78226540642527
attained manhood. I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for	259.1627536810387
none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of	353.5436550920351
love. Well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved	255.89891817729026
her, for two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all	217.71213020812752
the virtues of a daughter and wife. Count, to possess Valentine would	357.1411213645662
have been a happiness too infinite, too ecstatic, too complete, too	329.31171601910864
divine for this world, since it has been denied me; but without	353.49429375297285
Valentine the earth is desolate.”	317.03013066780437
“I have told you to hope,” said the count.	182.44050684156528
“Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you	287.70751490521326
succeed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again	325.36816403315584
behold Valentine.”	359.4706214497233
The count smiled.	256.29911292867996
“My friend, my father,” said Morrel with excitement, “have a care, I	254.032151952627
again repeat, for the power you wield over me alarms me. Weigh your	273.58451340920175
words before you speak, for my eyes have already become brighter, and	336.43791337493803
my heart beats strongly; be cautious, or you will make me believe in	286.07250698991726
supernatural agencies. I must obey you, though you bade me call forth	180.9865591092102
the dead or walk upon the water.”	326.80739660315464
“Hope, my friend,” repeated the count.	272.10296656368723
“Ah,” said Morrel, falling from the height of excitement to the abyss	337.72540788212063
of despair—“ah, you are playing with me, like those good, or rather	231.91490398550482
selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words, because	355.58189835701467
their screams annoy them. No, my friend, I was wrong to caution you; do	294.45505520795854
not fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will disguise it	355.5222692265243
so, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me. Adieu, my	359.66593000549955
friend, adieu!”	278.82784814563865
“On the contrary,” said the count, “after this time you must live with	177.89009485268696
me—you must not leave me, and in a week we shall have left France	272.0978954475831
behind us.”	171.04792734157763
“And you still bid me hope?”	341.6416653171584
“I tell you to hope, because I have a method of curing you.”	252.31899944440144
“Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible. You think	278.01415287673683
the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and you	344.52821967109554
would cure it by an ordinary remedy—change of scene.” And Morrel	177.82829847505445
dropped his head with disdainful incredulity.	294.6578241287758
“What can I say more?” asked Monte Cristo. “I have confidence in the	264.79494380436176
remedy I propose, and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its	194.67666932273184
efficacy.”	266.1428026589416
“Count, you prolong my agony.”	213.6154798429581
“Then,” said the count, “your feeble spirit will not even grant me the	215.5280735087935
trial I request? Come—do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is	333.34964875390534
capable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his	278.91696709570726
control? nay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well, wait for the	323.4139165031871
miracle I hope to accomplish, or——”	243.95619781840188
“Or?” repeated Morrel.	191.1651296292193
“Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.”	312.87987656535154
“Have pity on me, count!”	237.66636978060285
“I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that—listen to me	328.19213119195626
attentively—if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very	230.6734539273224
hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you,	229.11055382670085
and a cup of the deadliest Italian poison—a poison more sure and prompt	208.64862704080446
than that which has killed Valentine.”	197.78318448132893
“Will you promise me?”	179.48694214084443
“Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also	249.49186853820368
contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have	278.11519008393975
longed for the delights of an eternal sleep.”	275.7596827650616
“But you are sure you will promise me this?” said Morrel, intoxicated.	217.32006431829845
“I not only promise, but swear it!” said Monte Cristo extending his	218.11585499708218
hand.	259.77604587785413
“In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let me	335.61963756959966
take my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not	348.69060384461864
call me ungrateful?”	322.41155987412014
“In a month, to the day, the very hour and the date is a sacred one,	296.1515143646126
Maximilian. I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of	217.18099285155083
September; it is ten years today since I saved your father’s life, who	221.87655771434376
wished to die.”	297.01505312309257
Morrel seized the count’s hand and kissed it; the count allowed him to	260.15596280885705
pay the homage he felt due to him.	210.93520989767077
“In a month you will find on the table, at which we shall be then	195.56356587789165
sitting, good pistols and a delicious draught; but, on the other hand,	181.295338229474
you must promise me not to attempt your life before that time.”	343.18822322477956
“Oh, I also swear it!”	201.39756520846072
Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him, and pressed him for some	339.0710454875183
time to his heart. “And now,” he said, “after today, you will come and	253.24749817530824
live with me; you can occupy Haydée’s apartment, and my daughter will	354.2123807697376
at least be replaced by my son.”	210.24419810961228
“Haydée?” said Morrel, “what has become of her?”	258.87025537742625
“She departed last night.”	292.73286384199673
“To leave you?”	274.25950787268437
“To wait for me. Hold yourself ready then to join me at the	195.92712168936495
Champs-Élysées, and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my	363.34844439558594
departure.”	243.92254479491578
Maximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike reverence.	308.912390468927
 Chapter 106. Dividing the Proceeds	352.13702954973434
The apartment on the first floor of the house in the Rue	261.9062408906543
Saint-Germain-des-Prés, where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for	363.6931556561085
his mother, was let to a very mysterious person. This was a man whose	359.5969379056719
face the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin	321.09968751781753
was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen’s	216.7985749933553
coachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always	329.93948496849765
blowing his nose just as he approached the door. Contrary to custom,	334.1408973288569
this gentleman had not been watched, for as the report ran that he was	195.62557255209097
a person of high rank, and one who would allow no impertinent	202.27960298316248
interference, his _incognito_ was strictly respected.	270.4552727607798
His visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared a	306.7577145151168
little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and	333.3501551879293
winter, he took possession of his apartment about four o’clock, though	338.6392695213683
he never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the	209.92554856095924
fire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence	193.28364734025556
of the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the	370.9154729434805
table at the same hour. At four o’clock, as we have already stated, the	333.4592871501826
mysterious personage arrived.	268.9802060664123
Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady	275.07110296375515
alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled; she	225.94376751298987
passed like a shadow through the lodge, and ran upstairs without a	360.8593260542556
sound escaping under the touch of her light foot. No one ever asked her	310.4916675873783
where she was going. Her face, therefore, like that of the gentleman,	238.76614328576937
was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who were perhaps	318.4247209180033
unequalled throughout the capital for discretion. We need not say she	265.3615247333772
stopped at the first floor. Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a	298.812450536038
door, which after being opened to admit her was again fastened, and	299.92294350901966
curiosity penetrated no farther. They used the same precautions in	340.38019604365957
leaving as in entering the house. The lady always left first, and as	242.7709878529202
soon as she had stepped into her carriage, it drove away, sometimes	283.7687153802649
towards the right hand, sometimes to the left; then about twenty	295.09000793834394
minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave, buried in his cravat	247.05106448974365
or concealed by his handkerchief.	349.3830024924973
The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious	333.81479387033465
lodger entered at ten o’clock in the morning instead of four in the	341.29370133176843
afternoon. Almost directly afterwards, without the usual interval of	344.93404249886413
time, a cab arrived, and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs. The door	233.32694976412
opened, but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed:	338.79394095195653
“Oh, Lucien—oh, my friend!”	287.44980649352146
The concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger’s name	280.48547107328983
was Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection of a door-keeper, he	211.64928659263848
made up his mind not to tell his wife.	296.9262350042542
“Well, what is the matter, my dear?” asked the gentleman whose name the	347.65117565779144
lady’s agitation revealed; “tell me what is the matter.”	332.6346626146943
“Oh, Lucien, can I confide in you?”	276.9329863819455
“Of course, you know you can do so. But what can be the matter? Your	206.86871113045504
note of this morning has completely bewildered me. This	257.1776367169898
precipitation—this unusual appointment. Come, ease me of my anxiety, or	334.1273213894386
else frighten me at once.”	228.0391914118672
“Lucien, a great event has happened!” said the lady, glancing	359.6110791039432
inquiringly at Lucien,—“M. Danglars left last night!”	254.19844783594027
“Left?—M. Danglars left? Where has he gone?”	243.02136140469344
“I do not know.”	318.79959459712586
“What do you mean? Has he gone intending not to return?”	300.1862443816054
“Undoubtedly;—at ten o’clock at night his horses took him to the	172.7216563868484
barrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him—he	215.8772553434393
entered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to	223.91940428878897
Fontainebleau.”	268.24038701210196
“Then what did you mean——”	205.6188476439046
“Stay—he left a letter for me.”	194.03597111133865
“A letter?”	294.69244104926577
“Yes; read it.”	338.07638779423894
And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to	197.11113186310143
Debray. Debray paused a moment before reading, as if trying to guess	279.35443955116676
its contents, or perhaps while making up his mind how to act, whatever	203.30281504732346
it might contain. No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few minutes,	240.8988921174264
for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness in the	343.63037473232794
heart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:	339.93296020671124
“‘Madame and most faithful wife.’”	216.21983242695302
Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face	205.59043196270216
became covered with blushes.	342.412279278509
“Read,” she said.	310.4418664815265
Debray continued:	343.6055494545484
“‘When you receive this, you will no longer have a husband. Oh, you	313.89362988556525
need not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your	216.39729342767407
daughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or	197.57052438217116
forty roads leading out of France. I owe you some explanations for my	320.99491760508664
conduct, and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me, I	360.2575180336064
will give them. Listen, then. I received this morning five millions	212.59669496436533
which I paid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the	253.4127985831523
same sum was presented to me; I put this creditor off till tomorrow and	294.3064700292904
I intend leaving today, to escape that tomorrow, which would be rather	370.1718028483999
too unpleasant for me to endure. You understand this, do you not, my	336.54297386500247
most precious wife? I say you understand this, because you are as	279.8158165974168
conversant with my affairs as I am; indeed, I think you understand them	331.07295463423645
better, since I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable	300.2425149511486
portion of my fortune, once very tolerable, while I am sure, madame,	325.00275610882824
that you know perfectly well. For women have infallible instincts; they	197.6495721860967
can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have	357.30880754799654
invented; but I, who only understand my own figures, know nothing more	262.0279702379877
than that one day these figures deceived me. Have you admired the	321.1267743558843
rapidity of my fall? Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden	298.3453054459636
fusion of my ingots? I confess I have seen nothing but the fire; let us	172.6468083208833
hope you have found some gold among the ashes. With this consoling	291.8232801197003
idea, I leave you, madame, and most prudent wife, without any	269.62939326970036
conscientious reproach for abandoning you; you have friends left, and	257.5387862857534
the ashes I have already mentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten	268.95504599628197
to restore to you. And here, madame, I must add another word of	333.13384461470434
explanation. So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our	182.7312513246122
house and for the fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my	363.18018638845024
eyes; but as you have transformed that house into a vast ruin I will	267.5182613957607
not be the foundation of another man’s fortune. You were rich when I	300.52657419748664
married you, but little respected. Excuse me for speaking so very	353.191255903164
candidly, but as this is intended only for ourselves, I do not see why	243.1800837054974
I should weigh my words. I have augmented our fortune, and it has	355.25813666793624
continued to increase during the last fifteen years, till extraordinary	239.65508127617767
and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it,—without any	348.44565042559543
fault of mine, I can honestly declare. You, madame, have only sought to	346.8885100125294
increase your own, and I am convinced that you have succeeded. I leave	284.9798365276057
you, therefore, as I took you,—rich, but little respected. Adieu! I	332.656498030854
also intend from this time to work on my own account. Accept my	262.5614348524238
acknowledgments for the example you have set me, and which I intend	289.83160082850424
following.	351.97533533486614
“‘Your very devoted husband,	216.8280463475835
“‘Baron Danglars.’”	185.72566516879687
The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful	205.48660372780617
letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color	370.80959960762095
once or twice. When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and	297.05173697531706
resumed his pensive attitude.	209.46667810242604
“Well?” asked Madame Danglars, with an anxiety easy to be understood.	334.94676975192124
“Well, madame?” unhesitatingly repeated Debray.	351.30446794710554
“With what ideas does that letter inspire you?”	313.0746416367539
“Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M.	181.5381270789603
Danglars has left suspiciously.”	364.68890675480463
“Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?”	348.8625354569716
“I do not understand you,” said Debray with freezing coldness.	358.9550090656556
“He is gone! Gone, never to return!”	251.30646005981015
“Oh, madame, do not think that!”	196.42572014007104
“I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is	202.81527730135244
inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests. If he could	339.6707945428233
have made any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me	233.09853490000432
in Paris, as our separation will conduce to his benefit;—therefore he	271.0648657935624
has gone, and I am free forever,” added Madame Danglars, in the same	187.2722356460057
supplicating tone.	324.51656287902057
Debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude of	258.81995738985665
nervous inquiry.	344.6967997011517
“Well?” she said at length, “do you not answer me?”	336.39473959303416
“I have but one question to ask you,—what do you intend to do?”	313.42055261879875
“I was going to ask you,” replied the baroness with a beating heart.	242.09846718315254
“Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?”	240.56048184782105
“Yes; I do wish to ask your advice,” said Madame Danglars with anxious	239.68839424379667
expectation.	220.85974027199734
“Then if you wish to take my advice,” said the young man coldly, “I	189.2804589164125
would recommend you to travel.”	251.57384914421957
“To travel!” she murmured.	356.55545620287876
“Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free. In	216.56218822367273
my opinion, a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the	323.447626374038
double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars’ broken contract and M.	203.63823034604314
Danglars’ disappearance. The world will think you abandoned and poor,	229.88960453457256
for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep up	298.3759986468647
an appearance of opulence. You have only to remain in Paris for about a	222.68031753256707
fortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the	353.6197477112905
details of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread	273.6071204340444
the report. Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and	254.9650878802137
giving up your jointure, and everyone’s mouth will be filled with	223.8884966409863
praises of your disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and	224.01879313094972
think you also poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and	251.50621289949754
am quite ready to give up my accounts as an honest partner.”	292.21525383009987
The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this,	315.9527000674911
was equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken.	298.63250657802394
“Deserted?” she repeated; “ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are	188.04831280594604
right, sir, and no one can doubt my position.”	351.2889936549251
These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman	331.9850321393508
could utter in response to Debray.	211.02920197334115
50137m	352.9515751864824
“But then you are rich,—very rich, indeed,” continued Debray, taking	344.8736973704786
out some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.	175.52597495614955
Madame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the	305.7616398724136
beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to	302.5804052754777
gush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not	323.55203698870474
entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the	200.65844475198134
fall of a single tear.	342.5859179112813
“Madame,” said Debray, “it is nearly six months since we have been	343.0742437067362
associated. You furnished a principal of 100,000 francs. Our	307.82253904836585
partnership began in the month of April. In May we commenced	357.08248818892974
operations, and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs. In	369.2136643947771
June the profit amounted to 900,000. In July we added 1,700,000	265.75648717723004
francs,—it was, you know, the month of the Spanish bonds. In August we	357.88561474865685
lost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we	187.8552764152526
made up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the	200.01464472536776
first day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed a	294.5783797694727
capital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,	271.72819153013313
madame,” said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical	270.6340022370604
manner of a stockbroker, “there are still 80,000 francs, the interest	266.88525025532863
of this money, in my hands.”	289.6388794558575
“But,” said the baroness, “I thought you never put the money out to	327.20123452470256
interest.”	313.2579780608761
“Excuse me, madame,” said Debray coldly, “I had your permission to do	238.65630617821503
so, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000 francs for your	172.86141181574305
share, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in	287.2084489326256
all 1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the	217.97092465771118
precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is	173.81661109399445
not long ago, you see, and I was in continual expectation of being	181.42319367207492
called on to deliver up my accounts. There is your money,—half in	300.4969649992879
bank-notes, the other half in checks payable to bearer. I say _there_,	322.9729807376634
for as I did not consider my house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently	214.31765669770354
discreet, and as landed property carries evidence with it, and moreover	258.2230364875653
since you have no right to possess anything independent of your	184.1379629585873
husband, I have kept this sum, now your whole fortune, in a chest	330.71772133251943
concealed under that closet, and for greater security I myself	281.03507307403754
concealed it there.	281.7892636760429
“Now, madame,” continued Debray, first opening the closet, then the	216.52798477316963
chest;—“now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each,	338.3017118359573
resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a	305.846851968308
certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash,	329.3460898062105
making I think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker,	236.31094679983363
who, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest	279.0744115787612
assured.”	257.313657096655
Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of	175.80124043966146
bank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the	288.5717455710551
table. Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving	186.3835452457273
with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the	188.62244842955593
certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and	204.90393760575841
mute, awaited one kind word of consolation.	206.8821334699426
But she waited in vain.	309.24318713172704
“Now, madame,” said Debray, “you have a splendid fortune, an income of	272.6425322566796
about 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot	354.54261319909887
keep an establishment here for a year, at least. You will be able to	334.0828897482352
indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income	355.83141586415036
insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of	279.7154038837334
mine; and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan.”	282.4618217316015
“Thank you, sir—thank you,” replied the baroness; “you forget that what	358.81795061993904
you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who	302.974613770239
intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.”	310.55197025870325
Debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering	258.14483252419603
himself, he bowed with an air which seemed to say, “As you please,	340.7172394089861
madame.”	256.83625390738763
Madame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when	319.92742901297174
she saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was	174.56370635337004
accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her	202.98421118394276
head, and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran	338.5832907597762
downstairs, disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus	292.92191579336907
part from her.	296.70317542465693
“Bah,” said Debray, when she had left, “these are fine projects! She	364.43027451018077
will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she can	208.57010252656215
no longer do so on the Bourse.”	336.28909649829393
Then taking up his account book, he cancelled with the greatest care	197.39336050304138
all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away.	341.3831416749672
“I have 1,060,000 francs remaining,” he said. “What a pity Mademoiselle	370.9368875978922
de Villefort is dead! She suited me in every respect, and I would have	193.1151113892041
married her.”	352.2564725551972
And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame	298.329887769968
Danglars’ departure before he left the house. During this time he	244.41248052914682
occupied himself in making figures, with his watch by his side.	335.9303343676444
Asmodeus—that diabolical personage, who would have been created by	191.88437279191695
every fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in	309.28547125224645
his great masterpiece—would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if he	266.32417695966933
had lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue	345.6368609678259
Saint-Germain-des-Prés, while Debray was casting up his figures.	216.96611223951558
Above the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a	240.6572592876488
half with Madame Danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have	200.053168034977
played too prominent a part in the incidents we have related for their	277.4343816070744
appearance not to create some interest.	177.96680906802027
Mercédès and Albert were in that room.	346.25789489388217
Mercédès was much changed within the last few days; not that even in	183.52217847818164
her days of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display	274.68795408007566
which makes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in	317.165506336745
a plain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state	179.91594425009944
of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no,	316.3748688495698
the change in Mercédès was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips no	220.64568818385374
longer smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words	172.96860554629035
which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.	252.61014527569492
It was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of	299.90061598529655
courage which rendered her poverty burdensome. Mercédès, although	348.1666982871501
deposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere	362.6890937361392
she had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly	230.6178845857246
lighted into utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her	249.8776281529747
palace to a hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither	272.81899513533955
become reconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to	294.4399751175416
place upon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her	183.02102685282458
bed.	273.8380743463868
The beautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud	286.0637461585195
glance and charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around	323.42057219223653
her; the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical	361.66426340123746
landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt; the floor was	261.9667991049702
uncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention to the poor attempt	216.74231326142143
at luxury; indeed, everything offended eyes accustomed to refinement	174.6530419655006
and elegance.	356.54960348783266
Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the	320.11884169039797
continual silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert	186.01150510652104
continually watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings,	317.0416916395502
she constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone,	226.3795765722079
which, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually	315.0497131468816
shone from her eyes, seemed like “moonlight on a statue,”—yielding	330.87626749291434
light without warmth.	324.18244639891674
Albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from	254.68320439777796
sinking into his actual position. If he wished to go out without	227.96173332079394
gloves, his hands appeared too white; if he wished to walk through the	255.86559141036565
town, his boots seemed too highly polished. Yet these two noble and	366.80800093080654
intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and	295.0753730062009
filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one another, and	309.80082800123523
economizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell his mother	194.50461418637477
without extorting a change of countenance:	355.6304148119498
“Mother, we have no more money.”	309.43943287352715
50141m	221.3764258594253
Mercédès had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of	363.7979795811167
poverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there	289.894448311101
is a wide difference.	327.11702772926265
Amongst the Catalans, Mercédès wished for a thousand things, but still	287.4311974002019
she never really wanted any. So long as the nets were good, they caught	267.8991070290082
fish; and so long as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine	224.56850561986485
for new nets. And then, shut out from friendship, having but one	184.67274872779072
affection, which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits, she	319.84189382301884
thought of herself—of no one but herself. Upon the little she earned	173.72972485969254
she lived as well as she could; now there were two to be supported, and	300.2154922595407
nothing to live upon.	194.92379967967693
Winter approached. Mercédès had no fire in that cold and naked	334.9023015840442
room—she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the	356.46324868195234
hall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower—she whose	342.4917115595541
apartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her	230.9172203953247
son. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.	307.6765522249714
Excitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the	184.62979901037124
things of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt	233.5211847137133
themselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having	211.55072631914788
exhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.	333.0855429277475
“Mother,” exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the	206.7985808188008
stairs, “let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to	279.79387084481203
build my plans upon.”	269.7658637652828
“Capital—nothing!” replied Mercédès with a mournful smile.	319.1961978618059
“No, mother,—capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our leading a	224.68159337190886
delightful life upon this 3,000 francs.”	329.91893041968854
“Child!” sighed Mercédès.	231.2591559998118
“Alas, dear mother,” said the young man, “I have unhappily spent too	286.73865855209704
much of your money not to know the value of it. These 3,000 francs are	242.86682020269384
enormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous	366.61083259817815
certainty for the future.”	207.06702476210066
“You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these	192.96651688393638
3,000 francs?” said Mercédès, coloring.	302.1532029674365
“I think so,” answered Albert in a firm tone. “We will accept them the	358.24179319642496
more readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in	189.5192971088011
the garden of the little house in the Allées de Meilhan, at Marseilles.	279.91192797312283
With 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.”	307.54920432206893
“With 200 francs?—are you sure, Albert?”	249.89013122885171
“Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and	273.75803495971
steamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place in	238.38621809209326
the _coupé_ to Châlons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for	361.8873615238524
thirty-five francs.”	358.75828533816593
Albert then took a pen, and wrote:	276.2260135088882

“Let us put down 120,” added Albert, smiling. “You see I am generous,	238.38448271125364
am I not, mother?”	178.25900543060828
“But you, my poor child?”	182.93663000905357
“I? do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself? A young man	286.0300534642422
does not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.”	302.3681010045448
“With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?”	358.33583313819156
“Any way, mother.”	322.8435233586305
“Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?”	201.9245808114494
“Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for 100	208.07932946369607
francs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the	274.2551034651241
ornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of	187.18166537252867
superfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs	216.4231986597399
we require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.”	218.52807108300905
“But we owe something in this house?”	288.44014123607525
“Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,—that is	226.6638852088936
understood,—and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see	283.3948355523471
I am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to	339.733806973778
this, mother?”	213.43793155569227
And Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a	286.3356054483079
remnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of	210.92891471497768
the mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little	278.4961618571184
door,—Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.	229.922845347023
“What is this?” asked Mercédès.	328.30967135511196
“A thousand francs.”	271.1467581310475
“But whence have you obtained them?”	213.25518853475876
“Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.” And	238.19708955611188
Albert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at	260.5036322592136
her. “You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!” said the	221.80756288686757
young man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. “You are,	316.74596158574076
indeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!”	322.953231617832
“Dear child!” said Mercédès, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear	294.3036440961279
which glistened in the corner of her eye. “Indeed, you only wanted	222.12689966561157
misfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy	246.5396205469227
while I possess my son!”	251.13880888978616
“Ah, just so,” said Albert; “here begins the trial. Do you know the	328.92691659172567
decision we have come to, mother?”	316.74585057206383
“Have we come to any?”	300.8284337531822
“Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am	295.9268283879881
to leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the	247.0760613722453
name I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.” Mercédès	304.32093391809747
sighed. “Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the	347.8811062534851
Spahis,”25 added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain	250.26282777457095
feeling of shame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his	341.9678132267754
self-abasement. “I thought my body was my own, and that I might sell	353.80034305949516
it. I yesterday took the place of another. I sold myself for more than	314.9340470801625
I thought I was worth,” he added, attempting to smile; “I fetched 2,000	357.93289327121875
francs.”	184.20311375166506
“Then these 1,000 francs——” said Mercédès, shuddering.	312.5730191179663
“Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.”	307.8478865661417
Mercédès raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be	227.26092756035496
impossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained,	305.89507673642726
now yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.	364.4742046950929
“The price of his blood!” she murmured.	237.41588115013425
“Yes, if I am killed,” said Albert, laughing. “But I assure you,	291.152649093096
mother, I have a strong intention of defending my person, and I never	290.63455546368607
felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do now.”	298.46660911648104
“Merciful Heavens!”	277.1318983949126
“Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be	239.5956924954233
killed? Has Lamoricière, that Ney of the South, been killed? Has	258.76408206703775
Changarnier been killed? Has Bedeau been killed? Has Morrel, whom we	318.01096589711403
know, been killed? Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return	190.14456356499065
with an embroidered uniform! I declare, I expect to look magnificent in	174.1893809665664
it, and chose that regiment only from vanity.”	205.10581279743334
Mercédès sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt	181.81407398828813
that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall	285.21382160616884
upon her son.	226.9692196129002
“Well, now you understand, mother!” continued Albert; “here are more	331.49847592403876
than 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two	217.1630939769238
years.”	198.88858445025662
“Do you think so?” said Mercédès.	225.87290993969637
These words were uttered in so mournful a tone that their real meaning	199.56185008607613
did not escape Albert; he felt his heart beat, and taking his mother’s	352.8758049754327
hand within his own he said, tenderly:	288.71226663319646
“Yes, you will live!”	271.4770847916256
“I shall live!—then you will not leave me, Albert?”	207.09547257886635
“Mother, I must go,” said Albert in a firm, calm voice; “you love me	230.25154023481858
too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, I	200.08751571187392
have signed.”	290.12852805466326
50145m	314.50089553641806
“You will obey your own wish and the will of Heaven!”	332.27383729618623
“Not my own wish, mother, but reason—necessity. Are we not two	175.48400464784106
despairing creatures? What is life to you?—Nothing. What is life to	345.4679366144239
me?—Very little without you, mother; for believe me, but for you I	324.9213674324291
should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced	242.80590506746137
his name. Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if	324.06714577910805
you grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my	308.33578424760265
strength. Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal	321.5268106083953
heart, and is essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story. I	298.71587303084266
will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he keep	313.28432586526446
his word and interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an	201.00419102492623
officer, or dead. If I am an officer, your fortune is certain, for I	348.6750023861858
shall have money enough for both, and, moreover, a name we shall both	176.19875725436302
be proud of, since it will be our own. If I am killed—well then mother,	227.26273856117686
you can also die, and there will be an end of our misfortunes.”	260.0077605704106
“It is well,” replied Mercédès, with her eloquent glance; “you are	345.6841973328297
right, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that	176.37077171327633
we are worthy of compassion.”	338.52544151229796
“But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions,” said the young man; “I	221.05598654168656
assure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy. You are a woman	230.98557349236654
at once full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in my	366.84567941707587
tastes, and am without passion, I hope. Once in service, I shall be	202.17326792800324
rich—once in M. Dantès’ house, you will be at rest. Let us strive, I	363.4869979828791
beseech you,—let us strive to be cheerful.”	174.28278629033176
“Yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, Albert.”	330.5083678643996
“And so our division is made, mother,” said the young man, affecting	232.5028132180644
ease of mind. “We can now part; come, I shall engage your passage.”	267.02241515790763
“And you, my dear boy?”	225.1096336128647
“I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves to	324.3450333773595
parting. I want recommendations and some information relative to	222.57937964532047
Africa. I will join you again at Marseilles.”	342.79227171844985
“Well, be it so—let us part,” said Mercédès, folding around her	242.85804534580808
shoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally	335.3842183607816
happened to be a valuable black cashmere. Albert gathered up his papers	299.060767551386
hastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the	194.62898468333847
landlord, and offering his arm to his mother, they descended the	245.03177526946595
stairs.	292.3181995603718
Someone was walking down before them, and this person, hearing the	329.41340687958524
rustling of a silk dress, turned around. “Debray!” muttered Albert.	262.1956737322519
“You, Morcerf?” replied the secretary, resting on the stairs. Curiosity	272.5722055958462
had vanquished the desire of preserving his _incognito_, and he was	335.3312547435706
recognized. It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to find the	220.76056493265312
young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.	171.08826348322242
“Morcerf!” repeated Debray. Then noticing in the dim light the still	257.5446960796413
youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:	193.90046315168902
“Pardon me,” he added with a smile, “I leave you, Albert.” Albert	173.27301825767736
understood his thoughts.	283.71558033793025
“Mother,” he said, turning towards Mercédès, “this is M. Debray,	257.2641443477169
secretary of the Minister for the Interior, once a friend of mine.”	191.6993892637793
“How once?” stammered Debray; “what do you mean?”	356.93755193622536
“I say so, M. Debray, because I have no friends now, and I ought not to	337.55462241523367
have any. I thank you for having recognized me, sir.” Debray stepped	181.57501565839013
forward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor.	185.16071226247294
“Believe me, dear Albert,” he said, with all the emotion he was capable	307.1909452963488
of feeling,—“believe me, I feel deeply for your misfortunes, and if in	322.88655704627024
any way I can serve you, I am yours.”	262.43628102584273
“Thank you, sir,” said Albert, smiling. “In the midst of our	281.3205173570082
misfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from	262.3277372474706
anyone. We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall	365.9708033554959
have 5,000 francs left.”	202.5843477612684
The blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held a million in his	351.60299367066966
pocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting	204.42902382084844
that the same house had contained two women, one of whom, justly	255.19099184709205
dishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000 francs under her cloak,	232.7485142652019
while the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her misfortune, was	259.49211323794077
yet rich with a few deniers. This parallel disturbed his usual	207.9765607700625
politeness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered a few	266.1529517109559
words of general civility and ran downstairs.	213.7009390306987
That day the minister’s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to	330.4167299866704
put up with from his ill-humor. But that same night, he found himself	357.88467428519
the possessor of a fine house, situated on the Boulevard de la	272.5369317402656
Madeleine, and an income of 50,000 livres.	352.86092911300864
The next day, just as Debray was signing the deed, that is about five	233.9698553735121
o’clock in the afternoon, Madame de Morcerf, after having	355.2204847351728
affectionately embraced her son, entered the _coupé_ of the diligence,	175.11801229150694
which closed upon her.	244.26670569727997
A man was hidden in Lafitte’s banking-house, behind one of the little	356.0646253685769
arched windows which are placed above each desk; he saw Mercédès enter	180.69837361792614
the diligence, and he also saw Albert withdraw. Then he passed his hand	349.99324463160116
across his forehead, which was clouded with doubt.	243.62135027773462
“Alas,” he exclaimed, “how can I restore the happiness I have taken	353.6575568550826
away from these poor innocent creatures? God help me!”	248.39424764383554
 Chapter 107. The Lions’ Den	215.61465005086225
One division of La Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate	251.06311198173984
prisoners are confined, is called the court of Saint-Bernard. The	350.4377225346925
prisoners, in their expressive language, have named it the “Lions’	361.74643838479824
Den,” probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw	315.29347307677745
the bars, and sometimes the keepers also. It is a prison within a	304.81485645700303
prison; the walls are double the thickness of the rest. The gratings	361.82840285364955
are every day carefully examined by jailers, whose herculean	353.990478486423
proportions and cold pitiless expression prove them to have been chosen	242.76763227579664
to reign over their subjects for their superior activity and	362.6102268274411
intelligence.	253.33678800849236
The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which	314.7231510730238
the sun glances obliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf	205.1124343251434
of moral and physical deformity. On this paved yard are to be	245.3240937195494
seen,—pacing to and fro from morning till night, pale, careworn, and	245.71270514354083
haggard, like so many shadows,—the men whom justice holds beneath the	230.2443292640362
steel she is sharpening. There, crouched against the side of the wall	360.7224020163801
which attracts and retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes	309.8577428684565
talking to one another, but more frequently alone, watching the door,	247.04617706012596
which sometimes opens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or	267.30027451847906
to throw in another outcast from society.	181.86381581323596
The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the	266.75118079633074
reception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright	253.11983587175212
gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent	177.38461998626184
a visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.	177.53839825631474
It is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when	312.6204043619729
we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between	187.08585691469042
those iron bars. And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is	192.1175735492322
looked upon as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered;	174.37901312793852
it is so rare for them to leave the Lions’ Den for any other place than	297.13315179767733
the barrier Saint-Jacques, the galleys! or solitary confinement.	366.9220536453247
In the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp	214.539521927399
vapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had	308.18278780111643
excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the “Den,” might be	197.2064297948698
seen walking. The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an	288.59242492018205
elegant man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they	244.18126378687447
did not show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful	264.8221023838767
hands of the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were	365.6756949712767
still perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the	358.0706425528582
appearance of a new coat. He bestowed the same attention upon the	318.4746236605514
cambric front of a shirt, which had considerably changed in color since	241.5326202298935
his entrance into the prison, and he polished his varnished boots with	315.38313598012337
the corner of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a	279.46684930816457
coronet.	197.52872315266222
Some of the inmates of the “Lions’ Den” were watching the operations of	232.62165361572445
the prisoner’s toilet with considerable interest.	270.1431805169124
“See, the prince is pluming himself,” said one of the thieves.	267.94062068100646
“He’s a fine looking fellow,” said another; “if he had only a comb and	204.83487314059286
hair-grease, he’d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids.”	308.84092323571247
“His coat looks nearly new, and his boots are brilliant. It is pleasant	269.76913016525333
to have such well-dressed brethren; and those gendarmes behaved	276.1045173758779
shamefully. What jealousy; to tear such clothes!”	201.45250705073178
“He looks like a big-bug,” said another; “dresses in fine style. And,	192.97033606981074
then, to be here so young! Oh, what larks!”	174.30653329062977
Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket,	296.8532126203129
against which one of the keepers was leaning.	281.72036587127593
“Come, sir,” he said, “lend me twenty francs; you will soon be paid;	262.7102500578415
you run no risks with me. Remember, I have relations who possess more	244.4406053520243
millions than you have deniers. Come, I beseech you, lend me twenty	284.6266010980721
francs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is intolerable always to	310.1581413440479
be in a coat and boots! And what a coat, sir, for a prince of the	350.18813528133734
Cavalcanti!”	291.6617360568453
The keeper turned his back, and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even	226.53758286604284
laugh at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so	258.790875558744
many utter the same things,—indeed, he heard nothing else.	198.43854012934736
“Come,” said Andrea, “you are a man void of compassion; I’ll have you	329.13250304919416
turned out.”	307.5499468570413
This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud laugh. The	257.2899867502046
prisoners then approached and formed a circle.	190.41263393568414
“I tell you that with that wretched sum,” continued Andrea, “I could	314.7137834153499
obtain a coat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I	250.9069132482292
am daily expecting.”	330.7138108489647
“Of course—of course,” said the prisoners;—“anyone can see he’s a	345.6655306206821
gentleman!”	353.49622858839086
“Well, then, lend him the twenty francs,” said the keeper, leaning on	308.0605552725459
the other shoulder; “surely you will not refuse a comrade!”	274.09555975926855
50151m	361.3663344225256
“I am no comrade of these people,” said the young man, proudly, “you	313.1998656165007
have no right to insult me thus.”	180.4621559598167
The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm	263.8309874108005
gathered over the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his	303.2332902139474
own words than by the manner of the keeper. The latter, sure of	297.44194985686613
quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to	346.74955172578143
rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate	207.13192501323923
Andrea, and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long	338.06216434839575
day.	369.0175281410824
The thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, _“La	185.02950232544035
savate—La savate!”_26 a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a	238.27172863456144
comrade who may have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but	256.90398844881355
with an iron-heeled one. Others proposed the _anguille_, another kind	284.7492342223189
of recreation, in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles,	286.35629421621803
and two-sous pieces, when they have them, which the wretches beat like	171.03112259982018
a flail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer.	303.10210631530964
“Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman!” said others.	242.3377442453828
But Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue	368.80298339298685
around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a	310.99078756854215
hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. It was a	182.5478825071212
Masonic sign Caderousse had taught him. He was immediately recognized	316.8161858466799
as one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled	265.80091499930353
shoe replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged.	210.62832122134583
Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he	342.1231504193004
intended to be civil, in his way, and that they would set the example	365.8311151075546
of liberty of conscience,—and the mob retired. The keeper was so	189.7453646794742
stupefied at this scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began	328.01893436188004
examining his person, attributing the sudden submission of the inmates	282.6377704588045
of the Lions’ Den to something more substantial than mere fascination.	239.22315594455162
Andrea made no resistance, although he protested against it. Suddenly a	210.47234005633436
voice was heard at the wicket.	361.9270379900859
“Benedetto!” exclaimed an inspector. The keeper relaxed his hold.	179.39147807516017
“I am called,” said Andrea.	194.1473341295721
“To the visitors’ room!” said the same voice.	286.67070446502714
“You see someone pays me a visit. Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether	294.0343213242526
a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!”	263.106544774614
And Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out	305.67051193750433
through the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in	305.63915390338144
wonder. Certainly a call to the visitors’ room had scarcely astonished	325.73100015417197
Andrea less than themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use	193.58124121889495
of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force,	323.8195874268548
had maintained a rigid silence.	288.9376018416668
50153m	233.4848051754859
“Everything,” he said, “proves me to be under the protection of some	317.87292919920094
powerful person,—this sudden fortune, the facility with which I have	183.09422470663776
overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an illustrious name	200.45737734581036
awarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most splendid	360.87732357618745
alliances about to be entered into. An unhappy lapse of fortune and the	299.50498158533725
absence of my protector have cast me down, certainly, but not forever.	253.10052014905995
The hand which has retreated for a while will be again stretched forth	351.37370553812275
to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself sinking into	212.74979118216265
the abyss. Why should I risk an imprudent step? It might alienate my	240.93935554607657
protector. He has two means of extricating me from this dilemma,—the	188.97852190508058
one by a mysterious escape, managed through bribery; the other by	279.0384643756696
buying off my judges with gold. I will say and do nothing until I am	271.71300888215194
convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then——”	325.2972923477545
Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate	316.76435390314566
youth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne	349.52272653188777
with the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by	274.4243452519987
degrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from	196.84427414531484
being naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort	367.28911954418174
that the inspector’s voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt	211.73583916823836
his heart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining	292.66696026125186
magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or	362.59707366338523
the doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the	354.9494294598434
grating of the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his	265.37749894489315
eyes dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M.	305.7131508642064
Bertuccio, who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron	253.3623523605492
bars, the bolted doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other	319.5812796743961
grating.	240.31837322941647
“Ah,” said Andrea, deeply affected.	200.63942705206736
“Good morning, Benedetto,” said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.	346.78802672050665
“You—you?” said the young man, looking fearfully around him.	357.3149439464445
“Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?”	311.3562522670085
“Silence,—be silent!” said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of	338.20207415800047
hearing possessed by the walls; “for Heaven’s sake, do not speak so	211.00853510542143
loud!”	212.77101409826528
“You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?” said Bertuccio.	330.67942581559504
“Oh, yes.”	323.75297984908843
“That is well.”	223.00498022901613
And Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper whom he saw	367.3847152070332
through the window of the wicket.	358.93256322009603
“Read?” he said.	339.67511661862625
“What is that?” asked Andrea.	368.05939692270397
“An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk to	224.3754381183731
me.”	232.36623843364072
“Oh,” cried Andrea, leaping with joy. Then he mentally added,—“Still my	197.01379616244117
unknown protector! I am not forgotten. They wish for secrecy, since we	221.48085969437238
are to converse in a private room. I understand, Bertuccio has been	338.5038337894033
sent by my protector.”	179.45052347708386
The keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron	344.9406778049371
gates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor. The room was	198.76825709284316
whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant	256.01036143826855
to a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the	300.4748917656429
whole of its sumptuous furniture. Bertuccio sat down upon the chair,	328.11171847899004
Andrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.	326.272765056396
“Now,” said the steward, “what have you to tell me?”	189.77499191840886
“And you?” said Andrea.	262.80235262386327
“You speak first.”	279.7768969649553
“Oh, no. You must have much to tell me, since you have come to seek	282.0238552468694
me.”	366.6788697988478
50155m	291.9749454679357
“Well, be it so. You have continued your course of villany; you have	180.61671204041372
robbed—you have assassinated.”	184.54174470930636
“Well, I should say! If you had me taken to a private room only to tell	364.308206554118
me this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. I know all these	207.19043114835443
things. But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not	357.32452648259004
acquainted. Let us talk of those, if you please. Who sent you?”	180.3319169170175
“Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!”	276.013939145426
“Yes, and to the point. Let us dispense with useless words. Who sends	294.6926618536421
you?”	211.88044018915102
“No one.”	230.0362631240362
“How did you know I was in prison?”	242.72339791792427
“I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so	318.1110582594299
gracefully mounted his horse in the Champs-Élysées.”	298.6839962750721
“Oh, the Champs-Élysées? Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of	368.78502051101145
pincette. The Champs-Élysées? Come, let us talk a little about my	215.92462322064074
father.”	321.6846334593846
“Who, then, am I?”	176.00255183433868
“You, sir?—you are my adopted father. But it was not you, I presume,	257.50659170830727
who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five	310.86798214237734
months; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my	367.50946172130114
father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me	171.32174417690686
invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating at	246.17478851710928
this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in	188.53583254684025
Paris—amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I	270.60750549191613
did very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to	251.89683560126446
me just now;—it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two	257.57976967262164
millions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place.	276.9741403888489
Come, speak, my worthy Corsican, speak!”	295.1114891350903
“What do you wish me to say?”	326.60277279151876
“I will help you. You were speaking of the Champs-Élysées just now,	318.77133535982506
worthy foster-father.”	293.5053903462916
“Well?”	294.46785763462793
“Well, in the Champs-Élysées there resides a very rich gentleman.”	329.28538245643006
“At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?”	196.7393881190119
“I believe I did.”	270.1480005309962
“The Count of Monte Cristo?”	290.25900440589743
“’Tis you who have named him, as M. Racine says. Well, am I to rush	362.41653828366987
into his arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, ‘My father, my	334.95786208731374
father!’ like Monsieur Pixérécourt.”27	205.42796297338666
“Do not let us jest,” gravely replied Bertuccio, “and dare not to utter	360.4666017922208
that name again as you have pronounced it.”	173.03828863325631
“Bah,” said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of Bertuccio’s	308.2628268265933
manner, “why not?”	278.5901825977744
“Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to be	276.18357140828
the father of such a wretch as you.”	277.8749969037734
“Oh, these are fine words.”	258.53510915296613
“And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.”	247.3490396989458
“Menaces—I do not fear them. I will say——”	230.48976129640235
“Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?” said	246.88584702115855
Bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that Andrea	171.0256966074529
was moved to the very soul. “Do you think you have to do with	302.9110459001399
galley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into	333.53958411231235
terrible hands; they are ready to open for you—make use of them. Do not	275.953882136396
play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which	190.0632189247469
they can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their	277.6301037430656
movements.”	179.97522002784598
50157m	228.64622680917478
“My father—I will know who my father is,” said the obstinate youth; “I	270.38482591532306
will perish if I must, but I _will_ know it. What does scandal signify	255.54625098338514
to me? What possessions, what reputation, what ‘pull,’ as Beauchamp	347.0765287214509
says,—have I? You great people always lose something by scandal,	193.4215880495632
notwithstanding your millions. Come, who is my father?”	271.445306556495
“I came to tell you.”	214.17157937106458
“Ah,” cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. Just then the door	281.05521292386277
opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said:	252.53450326906375
“Excuse me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the	206.47510794465578
prisoner.”	266.99123688850057
“And so closes our interview,” said Andrea to the worthy steward; “I	281.8491229201766
wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!”	192.24404852954027
“I will return tomorrow,” said Bertuccio.	353.33639937514704
“Good! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few crowns	248.0525761348145
for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!”	294.5152429971657
“It shall be done,” replied Bertuccio.	263.3305934373436
Andrea extended his hand; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and	180.5108098643195
merely jingled a few pieces of money.	343.5335314703607
“That’s what I mean,” said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite overcome	255.0167689413172
by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio.	337.63542836635224
“Can I be deceived?” he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and	230.30794233696815
grated vehicle which they call “the salad basket.”	271.79216774400453
“Never mind, we shall see! Tomorrow, then!” he added, turning towards	299.1442460475637
Bertuccio.	352.61907320333484
“Tomorrow!” replied the steward.	280.52449058996615
 Chapter 108. The Judge	279.12097726698534
We remember that the Abbé Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the	345.97771098418787
chamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole	177.62832911648238
guardians of the young girl’s body. Perhaps it was the Christian	202.61211087080267
exhortations of the abbé, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his	200.2324244676593
persuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever	182.13307333433679
since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded	306.40895545987246
to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive	237.4412266458254
affection for Valentine.	356.8520675080571
M. de Villefort had not seen his father since the morning of the death.	226.3896985155023
The whole establishment had been changed; another valet was engaged for	277.1919239473825
himself, a new servant for Noirtier, two women had entered Madame de	203.45002359676943
Villefort’s service,—in fact, everywhere, to the concierge and	325.93272610483007
coachmen, new faces were presented to the different masters of the	231.2615606347731
house, thus widening the division which had always existed between the	313.79886247142997
members of the same family. The assizes, also, were about to begin, and	279.85239292054314
Villefort, shut up in his room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety	207.8312987529003
in drawing up the case against the murderer of Caderousse. This affair,	365.152701179656
like all those in which the Count of Monte Cristo had interfered,	216.57002999176254
caused a great sensation in Paris. The proofs were certainly not	263.8007858594183
convincing, since they rested upon a few words written by an escaped	254.34508742152144
galley-slave on his death-bed, and who might have been actuated by	362.1426696500288
hatred or revenge in accusing his companion. But the mind of the	322.7873272519832
procureur was made up; he felt assured that Benedetto was guilty, and	258.80622640904886
he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated case to flatter his	217.4253060386675
self-love, which was about the only vulnerable point left in his frozen	341.1500840777917
heart.	193.0247071530587
The case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of	271.00102941406243
Villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming	176.01743957349242
assizes. He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to	257.8686662439225
evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the	240.64734510538855
purpose of obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of	369.6383749372484
trial. And then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor	282.33269814826707
Valentine, and the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent,	211.82449004937197
that no one wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional	223.29887068137057
duties, which were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.	363.9303020604185
Once only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon	197.62128118760464
which Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter	345.3549495914169
was to learn his father’s name. The magistrate, harassed and fatigued,	296.8872254478329
had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar	358.2648930395203
to that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began	351.64813496098276
knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the	359.8316313737497
rose-trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of	273.07071060585895
the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season.	263.59052738889227
More than once he had reached that part of the garden where the famous	184.81208064597593
boarded gate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning	280.9176369940401
by the same path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with	323.2850314154042
the same gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the	353.214571795679
house, whence he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from	328.3619778663465
school to spend the Sunday and Monday with his mother.	195.36351462559537
While doing so, he observed M. Noirtier at one of the open windows,	255.6809860509064
where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of	273.14343072483825
the sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying	270.54695344925483
flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony.	251.7303871406101
The eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could	266.5278699743997
scarcely distinguish. His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and	261.06023268728336
savage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been	197.45798617289387
pursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed.	340.6386404523501
Then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly	283.3588945364685
divested of foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her	180.5614638360952
hand, the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her	234.17857823472207
son, or to throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from	230.78599806662325
the drawing-room into the garden.	361.76555224505773
Villefort became pale; he understood the old man’s meaning.	340.6338836491776
Noirtier continued to look at the same object, but suddenly his glance	185.87658449499787
was transferred from the wife to the husband, and Villefort himself had	359.1175629300434
to submit to the searching investigation of eyes, which, while changing	225.99048312979292
their direction and even their language, had lost none of their	184.32178193031996
menacing expression. Madame de Villefort, unconscious of the passions	285.52296173338937
that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment held her son’s	286.6795479345042
ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a kiss. Edward	212.86804777225473
begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not offering	233.2575670472474
sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it;	294.4154994741332
however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a cluster	240.76343411286376
of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead	196.1616965606007
streaming with perspiration. Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead,	296.66808533073333
pressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand	245.7812733696943
and some bonbons in the other.	241.96257330968217
Villefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird	318.7935996605447
to the serpent, walked towards the house. As he approached it,	211.0592237636455
Noirtier’s gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery	232.68251206657328
brightness that Villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart.	260.7216469636284
In that earnest look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a	212.77694353669756
terrible menace. Then Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to	240.7113382148484
remind his son of a forgotten oath.	242.98685756493092
“It is well, sir,” replied Villefort from below,—“it is well; have	366.58877069208575
patience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.”	325.3873251360785
Noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with	307.4012055097438
indifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his	290.7719597811883
greatcoat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand	239.5168727116783
across his forehead, entered his study.	363.0676792417154
The night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but	278.82495487812986
Villefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o’clock in the	187.2601348893251
morning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by	267.4059839996505
the examining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses,	250.92169201399258
and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was	341.35998048061424
one of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet	187.52845308824737
delivered.	197.45563411779636
The next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning	352.90647834471906
dawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon	335.4233292788912
the lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a	318.4296832370163
short time while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its	260.38620507140473
flickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as	250.18743280756252
though they had been dipped in blood.	367.1248814273611
He opened the window; a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and	273.45714180606853
seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief	197.50114562224124
on the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the chestnut-trees, a lark	309.28722983913394
was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her clear morning song.	338.9261233462091
The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort, and refreshed his	358.47814949068925
memory.	244.0664621517671
“Today,” he said with an effort,—“today the man who holds the blade of	257.30305342315114
justice must strike wherever there is guilt.”	293.4360580653617
Involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier’s room,	326.20524022524035
where he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and	347.2853249840354
yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed	297.7618367302134
the closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the	329.4456075461455
opening he had beheld the menacing old man.	358.8986788501859
“Yes,” he murmured,—“yes, be satisfied.”	335.09436181683316
His head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his	291.67111935525367
study; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to	336.3173124748718
sleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees	272.5049978035373
everyone awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises	215.47522683723076
which accompany the life of a house,—the opening and shutting of doors,	259.7556704604672
the ringing of Madame de Villefort’s bell, to summon the waiting-maid,	356.4500356651049
mingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the	299.23361821766844
enjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him	246.15704311129932
the papers, and with them a cup of chocolate.	206.28881244532627
“What are you bringing me?” said he.	286.58900699095966
“A cup of chocolate.”	319.8116163115237
“I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?”	331.0174381362058
“My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in the	177.11209164742667
murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your	229.74887657316503
strength;” and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the	359.4293679039266
sofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers.	354.12353387883627
The valet then left the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a	343.32705087364195
gloomy expression, then, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion,	304.9299584557515
he swallowed its contents at one draught. It might have been thought	195.63956934363023
that he hoped the beverage would be mortal, and that he sought for	186.2004479275436
death to deliver him from a duty which he would rather die than fulfil.	328.4283539527183
He then rose, and paced his room with a smile it would have been	314.97712746258424
terrible to witness. The chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort	182.2540778864986
felt no effects.	229.48055840631287
The breakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The	325.7276764558577
valet re-entered.	177.76315189708677
“Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,” he said, “that eleven	313.1250976645131
o’clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.”	315.6308411728854
“Well,” said Villefort, “what then?”	178.10807184914725
“Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know	272.2875724294692
if she is to accompany you, sir?”	347.8197545713936
“Where to?”	278.4200218359937
“To the Palais.”	270.6232280108997
“What to do?”	366.62410073639023
“My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.”	189.01364836547083
“Ah,” said Villefort, with a startling accent; “does she wish that?”	227.85071442453486
The servant drew back and said, “If you wish to go alone, sir, I will	297.78763135808646
go and tell my mistress.”	179.82343583215862
Villefort remained silent for a moment, and dented his pale cheeks with	366.54165577918167
his nails.	363.17023352883274
“Tell your mistress,” he at length answered, “that I wish to speak to	274.1394774978892
her, and I beg she will wait for me in her own room.”	313.17644504279303
“Yes, sir.”	235.73127962636673
“Then come to dress and shave me.”	237.4028753400545
“Directly, sir.”	358.48949223501455
The valet re-appeared almost instantly, and, having shaved his master,	265.8929164770066
assisted him to dress entirely in black. When he had finished, he said:	322.3012346609597
“My mistress said she should expect you, sir, as soon as you had	321.34477462515326
finished dressing.”	271.7454693294948
“I am going to her.”	233.44251704341428
And Villefort, with his papers under his arm and hat in hand, directed	253.65167641022794
his steps toward the apartment of his wife.	230.96371803527472
At the door he paused for a moment to wipe his damp, pale brow. He then	226.38250484622785
entered the room. Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and	173.00025100649938
impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets	343.25417164584724
which young Edward, by way of amusing himself, was tearing to pieces	290.6173972604107
before his mother could finish reading them. She was dressed to go out,	227.52568970745315
her bonnet was placed beside her on a chair, and her gloves were on her	272.0559434419662
hands.	225.4547624207968
“Ah, here you are, monsieur,” she said in her naturally calm voice;	306.57132368800376
“but how pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not	283.38929657084543
come down to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take	282.91700070710135
Edward?”	185.4541769725766
Madame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one	294.7052979980808
answer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold	266.97720240601325
as a statue.	320.6885936353997
“Edward,” said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on the child, “go	320.1329659408718
and play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak to your mamma.”	359.2333654514814
Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold countenance,	337.16893174549676
that resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries. Edward	326.3460776418465
raised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that she did	263.7390900275241
not confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden	188.3840121988568
soldiers.	250.53483076265616
“Edward,” cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up	218.67468103635684
from the floor, “do you hear me?—Go!”	293.805336755722
The child, unaccustomed to such treatment, arose, pale and trembling;	248.03264609685948
it would be difficult to say whether his emotion were caused by fear or	302.56338316919573
passion. His father went up to him, took him in his arms, and kissed	320.2234944703302
his forehead.	300.9264161706577
“Go,” he said: “go, my child.” Edward ran out.	308.57882653036745
M. de Villefort went to the door, which he closed behind the child, and	279.8909107427136
bolted.	289.5834252868758
“Dear me!” said the young woman, endeavoring to read her husband’s	328.9062040674827
inmost thoughts, while a smile passed over her countenance which froze	190.82635998117985
the impassibility of Villefort; “what is the matter?”	248.9649964430111
“Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?” said the	183.8945984392935
magistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife	204.08556281479093
and the door.	228.54975719791787
Madame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of	338.4224785180814
a bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its	352.1572973540872
head.	206.6569969846449
A hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from	263.76727334044676
her, while she became deadly pale.	357.35682819791714
“Monsieur,” she said, “I—I do not understand you.”	347.8908896112748
And, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised herself from the	309.97936376795496
sofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other, she fell down	203.15514486424402
again on the cushions.	325.0759388635365
“I asked you,” continued Villefort, in a perfectly calm tone, “where	327.79358008712074
you conceal the poison by the aid of which you have killed my	307.00012186843253
father-in-law, M. de Saint-Méran, my mother-in-law, Madame de	335.3833778464454
Saint-Méran, Barrois, and my daughter Valentine.”	312.7411231801825
“Ah, sir,” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, clasping her hands, “what do	239.9237031722804
you say?”	267.9367301638805
“It is not for you to interrogate, but to answer.”	290.90832522399546
“Is it to the judge or to the husband?” stammered Madame de Villefort.	250.5837098595108
“To the judge—to the judge, madame!” It was terrible to behold the	350.1337074855361
frightful pallor of that woman, the anguish of her look, the trembling	188.1245704422796
of her whole frame.	271.0700659823413
“Ah, sir,” she muttered, “ah, sir,” and this was all.	200.39713029924732
“You do not answer, madame!” exclaimed the terrible interrogator. Then	237.42689895561358
he added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, “It is true,	357.8973412330315
then; you do not deny it!” She moved forward. “And you cannot deny it!”	283.86318374883695
added Villefort, extending his hand toward her, as though to seize her	252.63126683269644
in the name of justice. “You have accomplished these different crimes	318.22099041869274
with impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose	221.9469163614146
affections for you blinded them. Since the death of Madame de	324.1857610521274
Saint-Méran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house. M.	292.70601548711636
d’Avrigny warned me of it. After the death of Barrois my suspicions	354.61371711976125
were directed towards an angel,—those suspicions which, even when there	232.56545001392436
is no crime, are always alive in my heart; but after the death of	203.53360878024102
Valentine, there has been no doubt in my mind, madame, and not only in	202.48799011360313
mine, but in those of others; thus your crime, known by two persons,	336.7430972251561
suspected by many, will soon become public, and, as I told you just	243.24927974511883
now, you no longer speak to the husband, but to the judge.”	250.7484337556557
50165m	199.38850933969223
The young woman hid her face in her hands.	267.97649008780235
“Oh, sir,” she stammered, “I beseech you, do not believe appearances.”	315.09994745534834
“Are you, then, a coward?” cried Villefort, in a contemptuous voice.	369.64895578285405
“But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards. Can you be a	174.51321001733967
coward, you, who have had the courage to witness the death of two old	225.96310160928635
men and a young girl murdered by you?”	265.75837460642765
“Sir! sir!”	198.01419193183236
“Can you be a coward?” continued Villefort, with increasing excitement,	247.5127576678282
“you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?	221.00660591345584
_You_, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages	361.63399234738074
with a talent and precision almost miraculous? Have you, then, who have	316.3780772340235
calculated everything with such nicety, have you forgotten to calculate	293.0312452482352
one thing—I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to?	313.708919094346
Oh, it is impossible—you must have saved some surer, more subtle and	283.6630525198649
deadly poison than any other, that you might escape the punishment that	238.83850666736834
you deserve. You have done this—I hope so, at least.”	277.75466352874935
Madame de Villefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.	370.77580815844044
“I understand,” he said, “you confess; but a confession made to the	215.57437956051848
judges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime	329.6949965932923
cannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the	211.1878898309021
guilty!”	202.52906196580557
“The punishment?” exclaimed Madame de Villefort, “the punishment,	277.04570563492683
monsieur? Twice you have pronounced that word!”	216.08714600419881
“Certainly. Did you hope to escape it because you were four times	175.89411658265573
guilty? Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are	338.94374827713426
the wife of him who pronounces it?—No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits	213.48527791545467
the poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner	195.2579328988989
has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her	265.7812023884783
deadliest poison.”	272.4321057531959
Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous and	233.15722767081388
uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features.	302.5131534760067
“Oh, do not fear the scaffold, madame,” said the magistrate; “I will	356.22294046014576
not dishonor you, since that would be dishonor to myself; no, if you	187.62704184140745
have heard me distinctly, you will understand that you are not to die	172.25534549581144
on the scaffold.”	258.99077744889235
“No, I do not understand; what do you mean?” stammered the unhappy	367.2945300116096
woman, completely overwhelmed.	240.10346022502625
“I mean that the wife of the first magistrate in the capital shall not,	249.41685843234853
by her infamy, soil an unblemished name; that she shall not, with one	370.54731850141695
blow, dishonor her husband and her child.”	277.3208759598531
“No, no—oh, no!”	284.75892317419846
“Well, madame, it will be a laudable action on your part, and I will	323.5085154253756
thank you for it!”	176.2739737483666
“You will thank me—for what?”	187.2798738992753
“For what you have just said.”	299.39387294299263
“What did I say? Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.	358.38316474773234
Oh, my God, my God!”	206.18316046365902
And she rose, with her hair dishevelled, and her lips foaming.	302.63478464490504
“Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the	362.597013838644
room?—where do you keep the poison you generally use, madame?”	219.02655927051427
Madame de Villefort raised her arms to heaven, and convulsively struck	291.0895700929021
one hand against the other.	332.0631289036087
“No, no,” she vociferated, “no, you cannot wish that!”	261.3966673429495
50169m	279.61732587589324
“What I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.	331.26320514874476
Do you understand?” asked Villefort.	198.34464077082515
“Oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!”	332.12403854413867
“What I require is, that justice be done. I am on the earth to punish,	357.6892917320848
madame,” he added, with a flaming glance; “any other woman, were it the	302.92721032996883
queen herself, I would send to the executioner; but to you I shall be	186.92286213625272
merciful. To you I will say, ‘Have you not, madame, put aside some of	241.0820592667955
the surest, deadliest, most speedy poison?’”	211.83983269378626
50170m	294.26843609182157
“Oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!”	359.92989058927304
“She is cowardly,” said Villefort.	323.45188931246537
“Reflect that I am your wife!”	276.92663420893626
“You are a poisoner.”	241.53766858464323
“In the name of Heaven!”	204.58823585110383
“No!”	292.03380282933705
“In the name of the love you once bore me!”	330.75973103722345
“No, no!”	209.5090881317491
“In the name of our child! Ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!”	308.2943564270155
50167m	259.04212886630296
“No, no, no, I tell you; one day, if I allow you to live, you will	325.5519449323448
perhaps kill him, as you have the others!”	172.53875661390924
“I?—I kill my boy?” cried the distracted mother, rushing toward	190.61766863797016
Villefort; “I kill my son? Ha, ha, ha!” and a frightful, demoniac laugh	272.6272235906218
finished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle.	275.67651554104106
Madame de Villefort fell at her husband’s feet. He approached her.	191.51803978692502
“Think of it, madame,” he said; “if, on my return, justice has not been	288.5534640289958
satisfied, I will denounce you with my own mouth, and arrest you with	308.3065540020954
my own hands!”	243.8866453056886
She listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and	175.22154250164684
glared horribly.	237.29316221908857
“Do you understand me?” he said. “I am going down there to pronounce	316.52341269818476
the sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you alive on my	259.67546427423986
return, you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie.”	314.8113141138995
Madame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the	205.99818715549893
carpet. The king’s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity;	203.5126726574336
he looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly:	219.8827564919315
“Farewell, madame, farewell!”	367.19179199117866
That farewell struck Madame de Villefort like the executioner’s knife.	174.29426282858668
She fainted. The procureur went out, after having double-locked the	269.3690110589009
door.	244.85666815758995
 Chapter 109. The Assizes	290.24722151408605
The Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in	282.95152786103495
general, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Café de	220.46201602256772
Paris, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his	367.6943266327311
brief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of	194.46010296222843
acquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as	283.46720179275354
the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been	193.99844881898355
personally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a	244.34219580876112
lively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble	280.2173959069995
in endeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of	300.6112139926031
his comrade in chains.	325.6706021838445
In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least	275.75529380533385
an instance of, the fallibility of the law. M. Cavalcanti, his father,	315.01940936290987
had been seen in Paris, and it was expected that he would re-appear to	210.73960534269773
claim the illustrious outcast. Many, also, who were not aware of the	301.24155349830016
circumstances attending his withdrawal from Paris, were struck with the	328.5521477593125
worthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and the knowledge of the	247.69059968204004
world displayed by the old patrician, who certainly played the nobleman	363.54967779505756
very well, so long as he said nothing, and made no arithmetical	330.81624732953344
calculations.	353.15931423007044
As for the accused himself, many remembered him as being so amiable, so	272.4543726330666
handsome, and so liberal, that they chose to think him the victim of	186.49494853260438
some conspiracy, since in this world large fortunes frequently excite	176.3301990664818
the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown enemy.	303.28798268685847
Everyone, therefore, ran to the court; some to witness the sight,	271.74956800843637
others to comment upon it. From seven o’clock in the morning a crowd	241.10743233913732
was stationed at the iron gates, and an hour before the trial commenced	218.72011155106222
the hall was full of the privileged. Before the entrance of the	171.0067567605085
magistrates, and indeed frequently afterwards, a court of justice, on	294.19694068886247
days when some especial trial is to take place, resembles a	325.88789069992185
drawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if	198.1505990271128
they can do so without losing their seats; or, if they are separated by	314.5400165827393
too great a number of lawyers, communicate by signs.	357.6607069507667
It was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short	189.6183806476546
summer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise had	189.42738692832887
all disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most	304.087116349203
brilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor.	171.9343070448189
Beauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the	198.88543454938858
right of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.	209.4502064329695
He perceived Château-Renaud and Debray, who had just gained the good	344.79078158900063
graces of a sergeant-at-arms, and who had persuaded the latter to let	214.74255884594817
them stand before, instead of behind him, as they ought to have done.	348.0517525725263
The worthy sergeant had recognized the minister’s secretary and the	216.544740536434
millionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble	339.6015890908536
neighbors, promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to	195.05332788121828
Beauchamp.	224.0034253199458
“Well,” said Beauchamp, “we shall see our friend!”	223.55621055748566
“Yes, indeed!” replied Debray. “That worthy prince. Deuce take those	249.05215407674626
Italian princes!”	333.52508832917954
“A man, too, who could boast of Dante for a genealogist, and could	295.81011173844934
reckon back to the _Divina Comedia_.”	333.83973220329614
“A nobility of the rope!” said Château-Renaud phlegmatically.	269.0770430999629
“He will be condemned, will he not?” asked Debray of Beauchamp.	187.1311238360494
“My dear fellow, I think we should ask you that question; you know such	326.67009299041297
news much better than we do. Did you see the president at the	350.1984465483504
minister’s last night?”	207.09078424406928
“Yes.”	199.91731467199432
“What did he say?”	180.35958214902317
“Something which will surprise you.”	199.0281616368385
“Oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has	238.73560462433147
happened.”	194.60956894394346
“Well, he told me that Benedetto, who is considered a serpent of	207.14060207768676
subtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace,	309.73798485058
silly rascal, and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be	268.364894360157
made on his phrenological organs after his death.”	312.18180085892106
“Bah,” said Beauchamp, “he played the prince very well.”	326.43323653137554
“Yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, Beauchamp, and are	318.809129499336
always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover	258.4067926208831
a gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like	350.4825867284818
a very bloodhound of heraldry.”	357.5515361558005
“Then you never believed in the principality?”	292.1112872676297
“Yes.—in the principality, but not in the prince.”	259.8444903422584
“Not so bad,” said Beauchamp; “still, I assure you, he passed very well	276.54654160345035
with many people; I saw him at the ministers’ houses.”	218.0916465571872
“Ah, yes,” said Château-Renaud. “The idea of thinking ministers	334.9826305340862
understand anything about princes!”	234.2358189970996
“There is something in what you have just said,” said Beauchamp,	192.86887822382795
laughing.	268.2121497582591
“But,” said Debray to Beauchamp, “if I spoke to the president, _you_	321.48779889597654
must have been with the procureur.”	271.83682002004537
“It was an impossibility; for the last week M. de Villefort has	221.10242314749505
secluded himself. It is natural enough; this strange chain of domestic	268.62949066416473
afflictions, followed by the no less strange death of his daughter——”	181.80538271478383
“Strange? What do you mean, Beauchamp?”	206.2626535775771
“Oh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the	218.03225292504197
minister’s?” said Beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he	265.6782064295706
tried to make it remain.	173.94942244757374
“My dear sir,” said Château-Renaud, “allow me to tell you that you do	284.6236023250883
not understand that manœuvre with the eye-glass half so well as Debray.	326.90299074834
Give him a lesson, Debray.”	206.67921168960157
“Stay,” said Beauchamp, “surely I am not deceived.”	235.0118939665927
“What is it?”	342.6376517342179
“It is she!”	338.36530713512786
“Whom do you mean?”	283.07413695695203
“They said she had left.”	226.44877430588645
“Mademoiselle Eugénie?” said Château-Renaud; “has she returned?”	261.0688219091117
“No, but her mother.”	274.35690419277717
“Madame Danglars? Nonsense! Impossible!” said Château-Renaud; “only ten	202.91133193040827
days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the	284.873990482349
bankruptcy of her husband?”	214.92981669050943
Debray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of	298.90676725611996
Beauchamp’s glance.	347.52535895759706
“Come,” he said, “it is only a veiled lady, some foreign princess,	233.94072418037314
perhaps the mother of Cavalcanti. But you were just speaking on a very	267.8779406117086
interesting topic, Beauchamp.”	186.54266639397073
“I?”	259.94568206424935
“Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine.”	322.5428759665813
“Ah, yes, so I was. But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not	227.2895218239521
here?”	255.69460096378984
“Poor, dear woman,” said Debray, “she is no doubt occupied in	352.8173282031984
distilling balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself	344.06477680576637
or friends. Do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year	245.3155004135486
in this amusement? But I wonder she is not here. I should have been	268.7007853643219
pleased to see her, for I like her very much.”	322.8090618508479
“And I hate her,” said Château-Renaud.	235.0843928977818
“Why?”	224.02504540063634
“I do not know. Why do we love? Why do we hate? I detest her, from	277.3221837275074
antipathy.”	292.01285733131914
“Or, rather, by instinct.”	357.9634703613109
“Perhaps so. But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp.”	204.3676438725117
“Well, do you know why they die so multitudinously at M. de	186.99621949693807
Villefort’s?”	277.39731806727207
“‘Multitudinously’ is good,” said Château-Renaud.	364.56677523692235
“My good fellow, you’ll find the word in Saint-Simon.”	366.5848211286585
“But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort’s; but let’s get back to	245.18601849842761
the subject.”	324.76205173346807
“Talking of that,” said Debray, “Madame was making inquiries about that	307.69718320370464
house, which for the last three months has been hung with black.”	171.34795520087815
“Who is Madame?” asked Château-Renaud.	339.87026922976895
“The minister’s wife, _pardieu!_”	200.51602833582507
“Oh, your pardon! I never visit ministers; I leave that to the	280.37226913420227
princes.”	362.2256995162436
“Really, you were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant;	198.9469106162424
take compassion on us, or, like Jupiter, you will wither us up.”	209.5586587512763
“I will not speak again,” said Château-Renaud; “pray have compassion	291.49488815258985
upon me, and do not take up every word I say.”	218.85720835283513
“Come, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, Beauchamp; I	291.34812071838155
told you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject;	246.31444468211438
enlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her.”	187.54443263536263
“Well, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (I like the	180.25894178935724
word) at M. de Villefort’s is that there is an assassin in the house!”	264.90307925620914
The two young men shuddered, for the same idea had more than once	360.86852036785865
occurred to them.	287.0576941412108
“And who is the assassin;” they asked together.	325.81823689521565
“Young Edward!” A burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the	298.78078450671745
least disconcert the speaker, who continued,—“Yes, gentlemen; Edward,	311.9975070874262
the infant phenomenon, who is quite an adept in the art of killing.”	182.84468370579427
“You are jesting.”	257.8680820183604
“Not at all. I yesterday engaged a servant, who had just left M. de	368.9318437971617
Villefort—I intend sending him away tomorrow, for he eats so	352.6856383806644
enormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in	365.8917639118259
that house. Well, now listen.”	363.6127785380233
“We are listening.”	209.48077986467283
“It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle	349.6579832732401
containing some drug, which he every now and then uses against those	189.79712020164865
who have displeased him. First, M. and Madame de Saint-Méran incurred	234.69212734167627
his displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir—three drops	286.3333998002628
were sufficient; then followed Barrois, the old servant of M. Noirtier,	253.63456409051656
who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch—he therefore received the	343.314287844956
same quantity of the elixir; the same happened to Valentine, of whom he	245.66591251400214
was jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over	356.5340658113047
for her as well as the rest.”	302.6052789027892
“Why, what nonsense are you telling us?” said Château-Renaud.	251.38755014540942
“Yes, it is an extraordinary story,” said Beauchamp; “is it not?”	286.41576043832885
“It is absurd,” said Debray.	199.55632943281273
“Ah,” said Beauchamp, “you doubt me? Well, you can ask my servant, or	247.24432505068825
rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow, it was the talk	222.00144848081484
of the house.”	226.15104542051944
“And this elixir, where is it? what is it?”	215.48702499577337
“The child conceals it.”	215.16923477927745
“But where did he find it?”	315.1011198932935
“In his mother’s laboratory.”	328.0464341641972
“Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?”	300.64069983036813
“How can I tell? You are questioning me like a king’s attorney. I only	305.52553268446815
repeat what I have been told, and like my informant I can do no more.	194.98051668143995
The poor devil would eat nothing, from fear.”	174.3968100177061
“It is incredible!”	349.9590802475882
“No, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible. You saw the child	190.4064743915226
pass through the Rue Richelieu last year, who amused himself with	320.2251224071443
killing his brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while	193.0731258768044
they slept. The generation who follow us are very precocious.”	311.182739333792
“Come, Beauchamp,” said Château-Renaud, “I will bet anything you do not	261.03478887164033
believe a word of all you have been telling us. But I do not see the	316.1231645776993
Count of Monte Cristo here.”	319.4690273815858
“He is worn out,” said Debray; “besides, he could not well appear in	349.9715515200918
public, since he has been the dupe of the Cavalcanti, who, it appears,	369.527057608271
presented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated	370.6167478924774
him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.”	244.25865934731266
“By the way, M. de Château-Renaud,” asked Beauchamp, “how is Morrel?”	185.92483281155268
“_Ma foi_, I have called three times without once seeing him. Still,	330.55246673038187
his sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not	295.18022783945435
seen him for two or three days, she was sure he was well.”	288.32167669738214
“Ah, now I think of it, the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the	193.3418660001251
hall,” said Beauchamp.	327.8581481951361
“Why not?”	364.76686977453977
“Because he is an actor in the drama.”	297.56424008043933
“Has he assassinated anyone, then?”	295.93751957010807
“No, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. You know that it	254.47917894731245
was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his	196.66733779109302
friend Benedetto. You know that the famous waistcoat was found in his	223.5611313139355
house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the	360.87137451661386
marriage-contract. Do you see the waistcoat? There it is, all	291.0479137373738
blood-stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.”	224.47642454947115
“Ah, very good.”	268.5248001750044
“Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.”	362.8201197245861
A noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with	348.04181206436704
an energetic “hem!” and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that	279.1568105825401
shrill voice peculiar to his order, ever since the days of	173.4752163319244
Beaumarchais:	346.9737743216788
“The court, gentlemen!”	271.4737928605093
 Chapter 110. The Indictment	190.27401377467964
The judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence;	310.3283626799241
the jury took their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual	306.1129611938599
attention, and we had almost said of general admiration, sat in the	258.0184175386898
armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him. Everyone looked with	238.83054981685504
astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression	303.52927866621246
personal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who	370.7932514760662
was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like	182.49794634444567
terror.	231.25711638186735
“Gendarmes,” said the president, “lead in the accused.”	219.90053796087446
At these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes	268.8765437634276
were turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter. The	234.06417492579425
door soon opened and the accused appeared.	266.0465135072187
The same impression was experienced by all present, and no one was	251.4040099847519
deceived by the expression of his countenance. His features bore no	334.55747048377935
sign of that deep emotion which stops the beating of the heart and	317.9657675585207
blanches the cheek. His hands, gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the	178.5562346767354
other in the opening of his white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous;	350.59505776957815
his eye was calm and even brilliant. Scarcely had he entered the hall	267.2630138552415
when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates and assistants; his	210.39112908674622
eye rested longer on the president, and still more so on the king’s	302.7672122014417
attorney.	184.5444860868791
By the side of Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his	199.61873871816852
defence, and who had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained	231.58308379099594
to pay any attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach	311.80438152916787
no importance. The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face	188.53698128397946
expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized	343.0266883326433
the prisoner.	227.70189471592687
50181m	173.83718500323405
The president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the	296.63388562465093
clever and implacable pen of Villefort. During the reading of this,	362.1541098263449
which was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards	273.6158595713293
Andrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had	193.72810607389195
never been so concise and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most	204.6051591486195
vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a	176.03080894392065
review of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all	252.57649849609965
the talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like	236.71735460049007
that of the procureur. Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public	238.37016510547238
opinion before the sentence of the law could be pronounced.	204.7097470443394
Andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought	220.40846399673396
against him. M. de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no	221.65088455088576
doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was	172.42004366836503
accustomed to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes,	346.3630570505526
notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze. At length the	267.8527199404871
reading of the indictment was ended.	289.0448675741105
“Accused,” said the president, “your name and surname?”	184.3979496524592
Andrea arose.	181.42740315499003
“Excuse me, Mr. President,” he said, in a clear voice, “but I see you	234.6993727553149
are going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow	247.5415499729557
you. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an	333.847047632617
exception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you	234.06964502297973
please, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.”	197.58645211942698
The astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at	224.86363033857663
Villefort. The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea	325.8016466381921
appeared quite unmoved.	264.7276836277834
“Your age?” said the president; “will you answer that question?”	273.40558890600994
“I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President, but	304.2359620756255
in its turn.”	229.80732294982175
“Your age?” repeated the president.	183.66079519137818
“I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I	357.7049947414703
was born the night of the 27th of September, 1817.”	253.55454374282047
M. de Villefort, who was busy taking down some notes, raised his head	232.82556285800473
at the mention of this date.	181.2660396488895
“Where were you born?” continued the president.	215.86514149738053
“At Auteuil, near Paris.”	241.89938930464842
M. de Villefort a second time raised his head, looked at Benedetto as	233.16894817495216
if he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and became livid. As for	181.11449009487836
Benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric	271.4308864743489
pocket-handkerchief.	255.80712767429208
“Your profession?”	202.6428535014507
“First I was a forger,” answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; “then I	350.8054108958032
became a thief, and lately have become an assassin.”	279.7307050580066
A murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the	323.46181444062756
assembly. The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury	323.6269899121146
manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of	182.8415836483655
fashion. M. de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at	248.38914839978776
first pale, had become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and	343.18681089110703
looked around as though he had lost his senses—he wanted air.	350.51336182108275
50183m	292.80439836527677
“Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?” asked Benedetto, with	196.69044312533754
his most ingratiating smile.	363.6073106902634
M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down	370.126910986981
again upon his chair.	225.9248544211937
“And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the	215.32869993341114
president. “The brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and	339.6869884980757
classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the	198.11024822335818
court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to	275.29482732670937
humanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be	313.110362670894
for this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name. You	276.84475074741414
wished it to be preceded by all these titles.”	255.2985819928429
“It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my	365.12393743623704
thoughts,” said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.	213.40983562592453
“This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the	273.05785978450353
questions.”	229.13930609224136
The public astonishment had reached its height. There was no longer any	319.5934899358083
deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience felt that	278.3013201432372
a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.	299.45168396981467
“Well,” said the president; “your name?”	267.91386322022703
“I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my	217.74533383020986
father’s, and can tell it to you.”	226.45417374837865
A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat	247.01672211161718
fell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.	295.57220519448816
“Repeat your father’s name,” said the president.	228.7718113675386
Not a whisper, not a breath, was heard in that vast assembly; everyone	267.9517035686856
waited anxiously.	305.19390574140397
“My father is king’s attorney,” replied Andrea calmly.	270.92416858203774
50179m	235.62335309437984
“King’s attorney?” said the president, stupefied, and without noticing	173.04960708382472
the agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort; “king’s	278.76588253805437
attorney?”	243.16256225036355
“Yes; and if you wish to know his name, I will tell it,—he is named	194.42261849816768
Villefort.”	307.9836419654872
The explosion, which had been so long restrained from a feeling of	176.8390920157496
respect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder from the	209.80072719588875
breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to restrain the	227.45542337501098
feelings of the audience. The exclamations, the insults addressed to	352.47447863677337
Benedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the energetic gestures,	280.70509014945657
the movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the scum of the crowd	365.30447603204254
always sure to rise to the surface in case of any disturbance—all this	184.25610727157013
lasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and magistrates were able	224.13242510158867
to restore silence. In the midst of this tumult the voice of	314.5262475011866
the president was heard to exclaim:	316.86358245931456
“Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your	367.5016620950601
fellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has	251.1063264519679
never been equalled?”	348.52076212968825
Several persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over	354.1393650424858
in his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and	364.741502798846
protestations of zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the	223.9133333092004
hall, except that a few people still moved about and whispered to one	244.1790969901501
another. A lady, it was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her	171.88108908196665
with a smelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of	266.85814155230804
tumult, Andrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then,	268.7632156681358
leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most	328.11801718009883
graceful attitude possible, he said:	263.7187923951726
“Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of	349.7852171794699
making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable	318.3188215302371
assembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I	182.12717944271878
answer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned	240.65281120725837
me. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can	275.64728621271445
tell them my father’s. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de	261.2439769327278
Villefort, and I am ready to prove it.”	318.90664805728113
There was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the	338.8321416659288
young man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment	217.70490070837388
towards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt	178.99498580783566
had changed him into a corpse.	278.93627899115853
“Gentlemen,” said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and manner;	191.15213365463518
“I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.”	330.2998687170842
“But,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself Benedetto,	214.68753492955597
declared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.”	339.3630168626081
“I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have	335.0848972874352
just made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have	332.4944286140807
been the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of	305.59290815076963
the 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.	248.20206922950885
de Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I	171.66101934232907
was born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;	293.39593921264424
my father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me	323.0998966831264
in a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,	250.44299749094807
where he buried me alive.”	331.3642864276993
A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of	272.3298864461077
the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.	202.99428345215256
“But how have you become acquainted with all these details?” asked the	191.37739195683844
president.	247.5304390069956
“I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against	207.74711854286565
my father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had	316.95831641908825
introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried	230.3689349618348
me. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in	355.04286416348157
the ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain	327.0930765903971
some treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The	316.9934790017073
man carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under	355.1509686991182
the number 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano	329.2254256893267
to Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me	252.77696240035147
away. Thus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in	300.2736830476549
Corsica.”	257.9696812985188
There was a moment’s silence, during which one could have fancied the	174.78246537079883
hall empty, so profound was the stillness.	327.18295179016565
“Proceed,” said the president.	366.0629224605976
“Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who	269.1510532754955
adored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which	329.8235366605511
my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in	219.838365592493
wickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for	370.91855398631714
making me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father	226.36806579694812
said to me, ‘Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your	182.83910823457975
father, not yours,—of your father, who consigned you to hell if you	191.96561643654942
died, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.’ After that I	302.3363057299101
ceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have uttered	367.4811490625077
the words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this whole	324.1378437809849
assembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime, punish	281.5426757855723
me, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate	192.4594449058311
has been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.”	333.04093940827465
“But your mother?” asked the president.	296.21501333199717
“My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish to	290.5475851477697
know her name, nor do I know it.”	208.73856470594922
Just then a piercing cry, ending in a sob, burst from the centre of the	221.92387696019438
crowd, who encircled the lady who had before fainted, and who now fell	255.0146217684494
into a violent fit of hysterics. She was carried out of the hall, the	319.2048984427216
thick veil which concealed her face dropped off, and Madame Danglars	200.38746946508266
was recognized. Notwithstanding his shattered nerves, the ringing	296.2449155859558
sensation in his ears, and the madness which turned his brain,	229.24067665288194
Villefort rose as he perceived her.	231.22735123297383
“The proofs, the proofs!” said the president; “remember this tissue of	356.9090082607579
horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.”	233.1837578149091
“The proofs?” said Benedetto, laughing; “do you want proofs?”	316.1827642063496
“Yes.”	300.19331244149924
“Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.”	324.28257887636676
Everyone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the	196.3122018884545
universal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the	297.8136029168656
midst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented	334.41665578711485
with the mark of his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of	219.62510198193715
astonishment.	328.7471727659178
“Father,” said Benedetto, “I am asked for proofs, do you wish me to	265.15974256639294
give them?”	279.504080435484
“No, no, it is useless,” stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice;	173.07588573888063
“no, it is useless!”	236.9594500507286
“How useless?” cried the president, “what do you mean?”	259.761963624431
“I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly	249.0622918175563
weight which crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an	312.21796651693194
avenging God! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man	342.271468354513
is true.”	237.13402933660947
A dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon	229.89712478602783
of nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay.	314.61592925041185
“What, M. de Villefort,” cried the president, “do you yield to an	176.73671645530695
hallucination? What, are you no longer in possession of your senses?	354.5354186401952
This strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your	317.8791853372387
reason. Come, recover.”	241.58206409949196
The procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man	364.7604555213693
under a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.	291.33785758495605
“I am in possession of all my senses, sir,” he said; “my body alone	272.5644951100202
suffers, as you may suppose. I acknowledge myself guilty of all the	282.6005063922255
young man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under	250.05829486704224
the authority of the procureur who will succeed me.”	357.3965098984061
And as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered	173.74591857515938
towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper. The	220.44661552612098
whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and	249.5274466781796
confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that	283.8665100678168
which had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian	311.7543473585978
world.	268.33999855195185
“Well,” said Beauchamp, “let them now say that drama is unnatural!”	328.21294861536455
“_Ma foi!_” said Château-Renaud, “I would rather end my career like M.	246.8461322891688
de Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this	358.0881166127652
catastrophe.”	279.0658197962361
“And moreover, it kills,” said Beauchamp.	306.5467835397663
“And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter,” said	342.9837709778829
Debray. “She did well to die, poor girl!”	273.7578671749775
“The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,” said the president; “fresh	240.7405316888051
inquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next session by	239.03223181861242
another magistrate.”	171.0368921517423
As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting than ever, he left the	193.9401009715656
hall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily paid him some attention.	221.0621392740485
“Well, what do you think of this, my fine fellow?” asked Debray of the	285.5308301489991
sergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his hand.	328.5781779457551
“There will be extenuating circumstances,” he replied.	218.88915377523227
 Chapter 111. Expiation	328.0514677298851
Notwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open	344.15909713122204
before him. There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions	225.46030890486855
that even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally	246.30866633240765
been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe. Many	224.74934600968504
people have been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have	265.0088152855807
rarely been insulted during trial. Thus Villefort passed through the	273.47441207713445
mass of spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew. Though he	311.8412583662272
had acknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief. There are	193.4003397996247
some situations which men understand by instinct, but which reason is	188.2037605722944
powerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives	233.1810776302954
utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow. Those	322.3382183289757
who hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to an	318.29175724632216
entire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in	248.16962639747794
regarding his outburst as sublime.	280.5799258631507
It would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which	184.2402044072965
Villefort left the Palais. Every pulse beat with feverish excitement,	267.85296624657184
every nerve was strained, every vein swollen, and every part of his	174.86562075227218
body seemed to suffer distinctly from the rest, thus multiplying his	183.53008531468856
agony a thousand-fold. He made his way along the corridors through	336.5096307000547
force of habit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of	189.27143320184084
deference to etiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a	230.1053684981737
veritable garb of Nessus, insatiate in torture. Having staggered as far	355.4956618680668
as the Rue Dauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping	333.8949519320539
coachman by opening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions,	260.43014297948196
and pointed towards the Faubourg Saint-Honoré; the carriage drove on.	318.2092148986542
All the weight of his fallen fortune seemed suddenly to crush him; he	178.06030206366452
could not foresee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future	268.092824328689
with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a	275.588042969797
contingency already familiar.	282.84220182195133
God was still in his heart. “God,” he murmured, not knowing what he	176.6190736776881
said,—“God—God!” Behind the event that had overwhelmed him he saw the	340.25862563201997
hand of God. The carriage rolled rapidly onward. Villefort, while	197.18366058297576
turning restlessly on the cushions, felt something press against him.	339.9318742557988
He put out his hand to remove the object; it was a fan which Madame de	171.89113094133089
Villefort had left in the carriage; this fan awakened a recollection	271.3606882282098
which darted through his mind like lightning. He thought of his wife.	209.03106115581963
50189m	179.164037097066
“Oh!” he exclaimed, as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart.	190.71995326318964
During the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his	316.2154788142666
mind; now another object, not less terrible, suddenly presented itself.	285.816939364761
His wife! He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had	346.46406297482247
condemned her to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with	178.70052709604727
terror, covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of _his_	255.193844685875
irreproachable virtue,—she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the	248.31535165886044
power of defending herself against his absolute and supreme will,—she	195.0904053507249
might at that very moment, perhaps, be preparing to die!	307.5001008640879
An hour had elapsed since her condemnation; at that moment, doubtless,	226.57781412100326
she was recalling all her crimes to her memory; she was asking pardon	341.74896092047135
for her sins; perhaps she was even writing a letter imploring	319.95498091634977
forgiveness from her virtuous husband—a forgiveness she was purchasing	272.4368999229082
with her death! Villefort again groaned with anguish and despair.	196.4808565715809
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “that woman became criminal only from associating	202.94884351416852
with me! I carried the infection of crime with me, and she has caught	199.9609640823005
it as she would the typhus fever, the cholera, the plague! And yet I	279.8204058304758
have punished her—I have dared to tell her—_I_ have—‘Repent and die!’	252.8520604851551
But no, she must not die; she shall live, and with me. We will flee	369.8451678720879
from Paris and go as far as the earth reaches. I told her of the	268.79295510173245
scaffold; oh, Heavens, I forgot that it awaits me also! How could I	300.343612735697
pronounce that word? Yes, we will fly; I will confess all to her,—I	263.2151893565777
will tell her daily that I also have committed a crime!—Oh, what an	265.56258247473863
alliance—the tiger and the serpent; worthy wife of such as I am! She	195.81483858361523
_must_ live that my infamy may diminish hers.”	364.91061528704114
And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage.	275.8708299648884
“Faster, faster!” he cried, in a tone which electrified the coachman.	316.90180590635157
The horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.	292.5214659726953
“Yes, yes,” repeated Villefort, as he approached his home—“yes, that	217.29137915733565
woman must live; she must repent, and educate my son, the sole	260.7279861362616
survivor, with the exception of the indestructible old man, of the	204.04589995023423
wreck of my house. She loves him; it was for his sake she has committed	176.8674742741442
these crimes. We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a	207.85818991480966
mother who loves her child. She will repent, and no one will know that	222.79168089216134
she has been guilty. The events which have taken place in my house,	213.4298040545936
though they now occupy the public mind, will be forgotten in time, or	264.9298176941214
if, indeed, a few enemies should persist in remembering them, why then	366.3422494944231
I will add them to my list of crimes. What will it signify if one, two,	223.44150355999957
or three more are added? My wife and child shall escape from this gulf,	257.18454853041027
carrying treasures with them; she will live and may yet be happy, since	326.3587605310148
her child, in whom all her love is centred, will be with her. I shall	323.79178730797275
have performed a good action, and my heart will be lighter.”	317.08869801191696
And the procureur breathed more freely than he had done for some time.	318.75046173474897
50191m	225.061067165969
The carriage stopped at the door of the house. Villefort leaped out of	369.8744074528067
the carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early	283.78122754627555
return; he could read no other expression on their features. Neither of	316.0462601137184
them spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by, as	282.2755426735636
usual, nothing more. As he passed by M. Noirtier’s room, he perceived	281.73581036071585
two figures through the half-open door; but he experienced no curiosity	368.38065607041716
to know who was visiting his father; anxiety carried him on further.	339.26839801139465
“Come,” he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife’s room,	181.43370297603724
“nothing is changed here.”	239.68385306751816
He then closed the door of the landing.	353.52938257569986
“No one must disturb us,” he said; “I must speak freely to her, accuse	227.02717411152747
myself, and say”—he approached the door, touched the crystal handle,	220.52062612023718
which yielded to his hand. “Not locked,” he cried; “that is well.”	363.53641141793366
And he entered the little room in which Edward slept; for though the	314.9733445835958
child went to school during the day, his mother could not allow him to	230.1110903725744
be separated from her at night. With a single glance Villefort’s eye	334.613801347865
ran through the room.	356.5214020976154
“Not here,” he said; “doubtless she is in her bedroom.” He rushed	347.52866509247906
towards the door, found it bolted, and stopped, shuddering.	333.9649124387118
“Héloïse!” he cried. He fancied he heard the sound of a piece of	293.3795104414172
furniture being removed.	192.1476284310238
“Héloïse!” he repeated.	247.02178456055742
“Who is there?” answered the voice of her he sought. He thought that	363.0701101442068
voice more feeble than usual.	220.32504038311134
“Open the door!” cried Villefort. “Open; it is I.”	297.14393453796635
But notwithstanding this request, notwithstanding the tone of anguish	249.97059665664116
in which it was uttered, the door remained closed. Villefort burst it	237.15665209543909
open with a violent blow. At the entrance of the room which led to her	291.6680782753267
boudoir, Madame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features	231.16147344320441
contracted, and her eyes glaring horribly.	204.6591534149586
“Héloïse, Héloïse!” he said, “what is the matter? Speak!” The young	208.67776221407144
woman extended her stiff white hands towards him.	249.55263930041883
“It is done, monsieur,” she said with a rattling noise which seemed to	295.67033192895923
tear her throat. “What more do you want?” and she fell full length on	335.7140526489512
the floor.	251.84363352401314
Villefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively clasped a	220.67663219613516
crystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was dead.	333.3101624916585
Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold of the	278.58870277317743
door, fixing his eyes on the corpse.	286.0636077787097
“My son!” he exclaimed suddenly, “where is my son?—Edward, Edward!” and	267.82185497554633
he rushed out of the room, still crying, “Edward, Edward!” The name was	205.59948653516264
pronounced in such a tone of anguish that the servants ran up.	174.6743533509658
“Where is my son?” asked Villefort; “let him be removed from the house,	265.3069961245319
that he may not see——”	201.36710142497012
“Master Edward is not downstairs, sir,” replied the valet.	224.1057296166981
“Then he must be playing in the garden; go and see.”	196.2697193968528
50193m	188.33567690306697
“No, sir; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went	220.2976545864094
into her room, and has not been downstairs since.”	341.5224840042087
A cold perspiration burst out on Villefort’s brow; his legs trembled,	313.7914318610332
and his thoughts flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a	235.1683339050569
disordered watch.	176.26822340027215
“In Madame de Villefort’s room?” he murmured and slowly returned, with	262.30815809503315
one hand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself	341.5363863273034
against the wall. To enter the room he must again see the body of his	340.80189144294354
unfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room	280.2125314237903
which now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the	321.6250167913168
silence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.	246.183325162251
“Edward!” he stammered—“Edward!”	247.53577448568456
The child did not answer. Where, then, could he be, if he had entered	235.85714497725291
his mother’s room and not since returned? He stepped forward. The	365.68561307384687
corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched across the doorway leading	354.6585976734919
to the room in which Edward must be; those glaring eyes seemed to watch	254.67154743252073
over the threshold, and the lips bore the stamp of a terrible and	227.58384816157064
mysterious irony. Through the open door was visible a portion of the	310.61425427413803
boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch. Villefort	338.94529140992387
stepped forward two or three paces, and beheld his child lying—no doubt	243.11792016579278
asleep—on the sofa. The unhappy man uttered an exclamation of joy; a	240.64704453662833
ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of despair and darkness. He	356.631072254762
had only to step over the corpse, enter the boudoir, take the child in	209.14822198177893
his arms, and flee far, far away.	271.1087102435697
Villefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto	310.3855557062203
death, gnashing his teeth in his wound. He no longer feared realities,	217.9508325080434
but phantoms. He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning	187.6454362110972
brazier. He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called	244.1136772658769
him, but the child made no response. He pressed his burning lips to the	278.2791676085574
cheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs;	360.24545523386234
he pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,—the child	238.4008324097756
was dead.	308.34006138692837
A folded paper fell from Edward’s breast. Villefort, thunderstruck,	297.1182075620134
fell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and rolled on the	236.35143838912393
floor by the side of its mother. He picked up the paper, and,	219.63061923694875
recognizing his wife’s writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its contents;	214.57849200632336
it ran as follows:	322.15364913569647
“You know that I was a good mother, since it was for my son’s sake I	326.9542183499775
became criminal. A good mother cannot depart without her son.”	244.30234135415776
Villefort could not believe his eyes,—he could not believe his reason;	220.46410377655496
he dragged himself towards the child’s body, and examined it as a	208.8678569273282
lioness contemplates its dead cub. Then a piercing cry escaped from his	275.2987249849287
breast, and he cried,	231.13717068582196
“Still the hand of God.”	235.3392371210225
The presence of the two victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude	298.19802076445654
shared only by two corpses. Until then he had been sustained by rage,	337.17874280127694
by his strength of mind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the	175.16702479734366
Titans to scale the heavens, and Ajax to defy the gods. He now arose,	356.8719463674552
his head bowed beneath the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp,	254.87737407633753
dishevelled hair, he who had never felt compassion for anyone	252.06246285017545
determined to seek his father, that he might have someone to whom he	247.70264358849363
could relate his misfortunes,—someone by whose side he might weep.	331.69829784855733
50195m	320.2009318392109
He descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted, and	290.12754564863616
entered Noirtier’s room. The old man appeared to be listening	214.26693551645127
attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the	265.7358556297307
Abbé Busoni, who looked cold and calm, as usual. Villefort, perceiving	172.60230226040912
the abbé, passed his hand across his brow. The past came to him like	271.93216419732767
one of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the others.	236.65883354835094
He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at	339.41816062531666
Auteuil, and then the visit the abbé had himself paid to his house on	340.34014515950884
the day of Valentine’s death.	323.2789105290292
“You here, sir!” he exclaimed; “do you, then, never appear but to act	290.3264444282071
as an escort to death?”	315.1879772646481
Busoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the	365.44645760464687
magistrate’s face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that	336.444769726634
the revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was	306.78379205771284
ignorant.	248.6147127436854
“I came to pray over the body of your daughter.”	203.18584112641264
“And now why are you here?”	279.14623012020064
“I come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt, and	329.11605668872875
that from this moment I will pray to God to forgive you, as I do.”	243.520509311181
“Good heavens!” exclaimed Villefort, stepping back fearfully, “surely	324.9792216230634
that is not the voice of the Abbé Busoni!”	241.6428458044332
“No!” The abbé threw off his wig, shook his head, and his hair, no	271.37485758501526
longer confined, fell in black masses around his manly face.	239.68289615768362
“It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo!” exclaimed the procureur,	341.7874955992166
with a haggard expression.	217.4507452291668
“You are not exactly right, M. Procureur; you must go farther back.”	274.7819865733849
“That voice, that voice!—where did I first hear it?”	297.49782206164076
“You heard it for the first time at Marseilles, twenty-three years ago,	278.70124188973216
the day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran. Refer to	364.399038143785
your papers.”	200.00539816344417
“You are not Busoni?—you are not Monte Cristo? Oh, heavens! you are,	248.0796324153218
then, some secret, implacable, and mortal enemy! I must have wronged	193.61953308672932
you in some way at Marseilles. Oh, woe to me!”	206.50950061589577
“Yes; you are now on the right path,” said the count, crossing his arms	177.18461874688592
over his broad chest; “search—search!”	332.1763135549612
“But what have I done to you?” exclaimed Villefort, whose mind was	356.51784159782835
balancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a	329.4367108276847
dream nor reality; “what have I done to you? Tell me, then! Speak!”	262.0972511815918
“You condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father;	226.7083474313893
you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.”	359.39297674109
“Who are you, then? Who are you?”	194.71394868617318
“I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the Château	341.3776448556065
d’If. God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when	217.55898786508882
he at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds,	206.7490399347312
and led him to you!”	359.7122568905801
“Ah, I recognize you—I recognize you!” exclaimed the king’s attorney;	261.2013892829133
“you are——”	246.39109377683158
“I am Edmond Dantès!”	332.884962185066
“You are Edmond Dantès,” cried Villefort, seizing the count by the	325.8598231808623
wrist; “then come here!”	304.01906420990014
And up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo; who, ignorant of what had	235.2986656515931
happened, followed him in astonishment, foreseeing some new	365.0726112162988
catastrophe.	230.64654279266023
“There, Edmond Dantès!” he said, pointing to the bodies of his wife and	227.08395427484987
child, “see, are you well avenged?”	208.08641194518535
Monte Cristo became pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had	330.62485231174463
passed beyond the bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say,	217.1076363829109
“God is for and with me.” With an expression of indescribable anguish	172.0832249363168
he threw himself upon the body of the child, reopened its eyes, felt	303.01821052879905
its pulse, and then rushed with him into Valentine’s room, of which he	364.7217567268275
double-locked the door.	189.45671512861753
“My child,” cried Villefort, “he carries away the body of my child! Oh,	369.9599208008615
curses, woe, death to you!”	361.6118653301062
He tried to follow Monte Cristo; but as though in a dream he was	214.99168971243986
transfixed to the spot,—his eyes glared as though they were starting	311.7596185701723
through the sockets; he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails	306.2615785451193
were stained with blood; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as	186.79811459481678
though they would burst their narrow boundary, and deluge his brain	262.1925340363132
with living fire. This lasted several minutes, until the frightful	250.111783397105
overturn of reason was accomplished; then uttering a loud cry followed	335.10076773144874
by a burst of laughter, he rushed down the stairs.	223.00327977839618
A quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentine’s room opened,	318.56145890954343
and Monte Cristo reappeared. Pale, with a dull eye and heavy heart, all	282.35715614410174
the noble features of that face, usually so calm and serene, were	334.7556418470324
overcast by grief. In his arms he held the child, whom no skill had	266.22262763861545
been able to recall to life. Bending on one knee, he placed it	309.1311263233952
reverently by the side of its mother, with its head upon her breast.	353.13740752191165
Then, rising, he went out, and meeting a servant on the stairs, he	338.94615681483856
asked:	289.3764883604598
“Where is M. de Villefort?”	194.3520491806027
The servant, instead of answering, pointed to the garden. Monte Cristo	350.69175157581117
ran down the steps, and advancing towards the spot designated beheld	297.7421011043734
Villefort, encircled by his servants, with a spade in his hand, and	292.08695651215714
digging the earth with fury.	262.4860087514471
“It is not here!” he cried. “It is not here!”	301.6213272608553
50197m	236.08218335919432
And then he moved farther on, and began again to dig.	243.1065009471331
Monte Cristo approached him, and said in a low voice, with an	200.50117326077483
expression almost humble:	315.00606002762214
“Sir, you have indeed lost a son; but——”	228.77314180585032
Villefort interrupted him; he had neither listened nor heard.	321.03356490428655
“Oh, I _will_ find it,” he cried; “you may pretend he is not here, but	352.91735368596085
I _will_ find him, though I dig forever!”	346.64296641532445
Monte Cristo drew back in horror.	277.7426641828731
“Oh,” he said, “he is mad!” And as though he feared that the walls of	279.12697067666863
the accursed house would crumble around him, he rushed into the street,	177.8540678865516
for the first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had	320.46137508008496
done. “Oh, enough of this,—enough of this,” he cried; “let me save the	192.10669712751422
last.” On entering his house, he met Morrel, who wandered about like a	242.7475802289735
ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb.	315.2909088281382
“Prepare yourself, Maximilian,” he said with a smile; “we leave Paris	290.1560060581379
tomorrow.”	300.85490960803907
“Have you nothing more to do there?” asked Morrel.	210.16930184596777
“No,” replied Monte Cristo; “God grant I may not have done too much	344.5824671267924
already.”	325.9314549489261
The next day they indeed left, accompanied only by Baptistin. Haydée	333.9470971048456
had taken away Ali, and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier.	234.22323829481317
 Chapter 112. The Departure	196.60914630432384
The recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all	368.4029903509694
Paris. Emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in	353.7947902687873
their little apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive,	323.32970614288274
sudden, and most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf, Danglars, and	245.20646140847276
Villefort. Maximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their	278.4999282290155
conversation, or rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed	362.1138401092763
state of apathy.	343.21955494711017
“Indeed,” said Julie, “might we not almost fancy, Emmanuel, that those	184.51787041447932
people, so rich, so happy but yesterday, had forgotten in their	365.20410209527
prosperity that an evil genius—like the wicked fairies in Perrault’s	366.9269016482305
stories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism—hovered	333.63214887509
over them, and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal	272.0720326485431
neglect?”	329.3358446785572
“What a dire misfortune!” said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and	340.06666151833457
Danglars.	291.25475617254716
“What dreadful sufferings!” said Julie, remembering Valentine, but	307.256160476062
whom, with a delicacy natural to women, she did not name before her	244.8324089448622
brother.	180.22287856306428
“If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow,” said Emmanuel, “it	316.5133170964416
must be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past	316.0082119113215
lives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment.”	361.62568738748735
“Do you not form a very rash judgment, Emmanuel?” said Julie. “When my	195.579760934133
father, with a pistol in his hand, was once on the point of committing	319.80464087706946
suicide, had anyone then said, ‘This man deserves his misery,’ would	262.3034393239126
not that person have been deceived?”	220.30902340154967
“Yes; but your father was not allowed to fall. A being was commissioned	297.8258351096697
to arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him.”	222.7822252346227
Emmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell	204.2622993578646
was heard, the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had	173.22933846278218
arrived. Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count	364.36221917504844
of Monte Cristo appeared on the threshold. The young people uttered a	248.03504909985423
cry of joy, while Maximilian raised his head, but let it fall again	338.85473192814993
immediately.	252.07959431971307
50201m	272.87193081773927
“Maximilian,” said the count, without appearing to notice the different	181.54785269861068
impressions which his presence produced on the little circle, “I come	279.18928279102937
to seek you.”	344.6014979225573
“To seek me?” repeated Morrel, as if awakening from a dream.	186.14984407954375
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo; “has it not been agreed that I should take	343.59928399782723
you with me, and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for	291.5678900399583
departure?”	297.44810348361506
“I am ready,” said Maximilian; “I came expressly to wish them	181.54143454374233
farewell.”	291.96316880570583
“Whither are you going, count?” asked Julie.	216.81249858653644
“In the first instance to Marseilles, madame.”	352.8240501991367
“To Marseilles!” exclaimed the young couple.	263.1813204436078
“Yes, and I take your brother with me.”	174.93244546665503
“Oh, count.” said Julie, “will you restore him to us cured of his	251.91624240309818
melancholy?” Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his	318.86088123335037
countenance.	290.05148925481865
“You perceive, then, that he is not happy?” said the count.	299.58295460864656
“Yes,” replied the young woman; “and fear much that he finds our home	184.2274675629377
but a dull one.”	172.37620484879858
“I will undertake to divert him,” replied the count.	293.05451525449905
“I am ready to accompany you, sir,” said Maximilian. “Adieu, my kind	286.5139175870386
friends! Emmanuel—Julie—farewell!”	329.6505304298518
“How farewell?” exclaimed Julie; “do you leave us thus, so suddenly,	345.0689333828733
without any preparations for your journey, without even a passport?”	220.24005049237869
“Needless delays but increase the grief of parting,” said Monte Cristo,	327.99822018365336
“and Maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything	186.6747308325059
requisite; at least, I advised him to do so.”	248.7885028809915
“I have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed,” said Morrel in	230.13772870922048
his tranquil but mournful manner.	283.1378228634542
“Good,” said Monte Cristo, smiling; “in these prompt arrangements we	285.3369629589557
recognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier.”	313.7686259775432
“And you leave us,” said Julie, “at a moment’s warning? you do not give	186.0363727037337
us a day—no, not even an hour before your departure?”	342.22497599580515
“My carriage is at the door, madame, and I must be in Rome in five	331.14157716474784
days.”	253.18377760282078
“But does Maximilian go to Rome?” exclaimed Emmanuel.	204.25178416370412
“I am going wherever it may please the count to take me,” said Morrel,	195.9951647180684
with a smile full of grief; “I am under his orders for the next month.”	230.0035584790803
“Oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!” said Julie.	366.87785452191633
“Maximilian goes with _me_,” said the count, in his kindest and most	250.91133275394284
persuasive manner; “therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your	244.14597371497075
brother’s account.”	361.67427367624225
“Once more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!” Morrel repeated.	360.0018354754055
“His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,” said Julie.	266.40699873013244
“Oh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are certainly concealing something	358.29907774004084
from us.”	286.8311084758307
“Pshaw!” said Monte Cristo, “you will see him return to you gay,	232.54427028851012
smiling, and joyful.”	262.0412188426136
Maximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.	272.35637570986466
“We must leave you,” said Monte Cristo.	273.8686869491924
50203m	359.2199406390455
“Before you quit us, count,” said Julie, “will you permit us to express	337.7236061648081
to you all that the other day——”	327.77234364183045
“Madame,” interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, “all that	358.56592209255473
you could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes;	236.0458765353436
the thoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine. Like	345.19117905495534
benefactors in romances, I should have left you without seeing you	196.50547392482522
again, but that would have been a virtue beyond my strength, because I	352.75586632716806
am a weak and vain man, fond of the tender, kind, and thankful glances	307.0659988527867
of my fellow-creatures. On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so	257.1969867772652
far as to say, ‘Do not forget me, my kind friends, for probably you	268.17555518344506
will never see me again.’”	183.29212151616363
“Never see you again?” exclaimed Emmanuel, while two large tears rolled	338.7070499833606
down Julie’s cheeks, “never behold you again? It is not a man, then,	190.39099715844327
but some angel that leaves us, and this angel is on the point of	341.58019383554154
returning to heaven after having appeared on earth to do good.”	193.99494880841112
“Say not so,” quickly returned Monte Cristo—“say not so, my friends;	326.5379801160327
angels never err, celestial beings remain where they wish to be. Fate	194.67453879974602
is not more powerful than they; it is they who, on the contrary,	288.4197793335379
overcome fate. No, Emmanuel, I am but a man, and your admiration is as	213.15843547540405
unmerited as your words are sacrilegious.”	219.17893321458692
And pressing his lips on the hand of Julie, who rushed into his arms,	239.21015078575084
he extended his other hand to Emmanuel; then tearing himself from this	293.4320978000681
abode of peace and happiness, he made a sign to Maximilian, who	261.6686152032081
followed him passively, with the indifference which had been	204.68771366891443
perceptible in him ever since the death of Valentine had so stunned	356.9474320605547
him.	329.6977351880571
“Restore my brother to peace and happiness,” whispered Julie to Monte	329.1726817877502
Cristo. And the count pressed her hand in reply, as he had done eleven	232.2174424070401
years before on the staircase leading to Morrel’s study.	336.7929364954462
“You still confide, then, in Sinbad the Sailor?” asked he, smiling.	360.37441614405896
“Oh, yes,” was the ready answer.	171.74275639826382
“Well, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in the Lord.”	351.60643801683875
As we have before said, the post-chaise was waiting; four powerful	276.15116452379243
horses were already pawing the ground with impatience, while Ali,	256.40745913136004
apparently just arrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of	306.144899362994
the steps, his face bathed in perspiration.	348.81771554983493
“Well,” asked the count in Arabic, “have you been to see the old man?”	186.15292039213494
Ali made a sign in the affirmative.	252.64023816225057
“And have you placed the letter before him, as I ordered you to do?”	348.8045457280358
The slave respectfully signalized that he had.	172.73702693087694
“And what did he say, or rather do?” Ali placed himself in the light,	246.4373856885366
so that his master might see him distinctly, and then imitating in his	193.49283475377445
intelligent manner the countenance of the old man, he closed his eyes,	260.57208985488546
as Noirtier was in the custom of doing when saying “Yes.”	185.26459653928828
“Good; he accepts,” said Monte Cristo. “Now let us go.”	257.8255002372754
50205m	280.7173917465547
These words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,	269.3394682341973
and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.	255.3220369900297
Maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word. Half	265.78203711022724
an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had	296.1132047183274
just pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to Ali’s	311.11003384333355
finger. The Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door.	315.11796098225443
It was a lovely starlight night—they had just reached the top of the	223.36360839108363
hill Villejuif, from whence Paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its	183.7438631175808
millions of phosphoric waves into light—waves indeed more noisy, more	292.6205962073171
passionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those of	288.768060876479
the tempestuous ocean,—waves which never rest as those of the sea	182.83660563890658
sometimes do,—waves ever dashing, ever foaming, ever ingulfing what	295.64489450544437
falls within their grasp.	184.69914163519343
The count stood alone, and at a sign from his hand, the carriage went	224.30145186618816
on for a short distance. With folded arms, he gazed for some time upon	178.8338400948349
the great city. When he had fixed his piercing look on this modern	178.51240124818452
Babylon, which equally engages the contemplation of the religious	309.13283596216013
enthusiast, the materialist, and the scoffer,—	325.6312680231224
“Great city,” murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as	201.5892447349871
if in prayer, “less than six months have elapsed since first I entered	298.0458608855241
thy gates. I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and	183.13423569552654
that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my	347.9425949424108
presence within thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had	189.78668357652919
the power to read my heart. God only knows that I retire from thee	315.69936677154726
without pride or hatred, but not without many regrets; he only knows	212.30652073545275
that the power confided to me has never been made subservient to my	237.7791800025144
personal good or to any useless cause. Oh, great city, it is in thy	343.493892190526
palpitating bosom that I have found that which I sought; like a patient	235.36209083524037
miner, I have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence.	294.8701744592807
Now my work is accomplished, my mission is terminated, now thou canst	369.6126413559434
neither afford me pain nor pleasure. Adieu, Paris, adieu!”	190.336605634803
His look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the	277.33512771581667
night; he passed his hand over his brow, got into the carriage, the	351.51847067741943
door was closed on him, and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the	309.061924315858
other side of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and noise.	322.25168234211657
Ten leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered. Morrel was	345.21093681923537
dreaming, and Monte Cristo was looking at the dreamer.	337.7409582948959
“Morrel,” said the count to him at length, “do you repent having	258.65525800281955
followed me?”	335.7452934714039
“No, count; but to leave Paris——”	366.8188158112211
“If I thought happiness might await you in Paris, Morrel, I would have	334.3642371840915
left you there.”	197.93167977311822
“Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris, and to leave Paris is	184.54318332716687
like losing her a second time.”	235.36205437305512
“Maximilian,” said the count, “the friends that we have lost do not	236.48722229333094
repose in the bosom of the earth, but are buried deep in our hearts,	370.93304988575494
and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by	234.12355276837212
them. I have two friends, who in this way never depart from me; the one	215.20406732384657
who gave me being, and the other who conferred knowledge and	286.5539859769472
intelligence on me. Their spirits live in me. I consult them when	266.9845194025103
doubtful, and if I ever do any good, it is due to their beneficent	253.8150249515405
counsels. Listen to the voice of your heart, Morrel, and ask it whether	219.89511399956604
you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me.”	231.69572600628857
“My friend,” said Maximilian, “the voice of my heart is very sorrowful,	272.91471323429073
and promises me nothing but misfortune.”	300.7037791428047
“It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black	264.5901087513213
cloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and	211.28655707833371
consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising.”	255.24567048945585
“That may possibly be true,” said Maximilian, and he again subsided	211.70449226194202
into his thoughtful mood.	195.6191241651183
The journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the	250.9756159177291
unlimited power of the count ever commanded. Towns fled from them like	242.60064917988115
shadows on their path, and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn	348.5437103944007
seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them, and retreating as	182.30805085028663
rapidly when once reached. The following morning they arrived at	347.87389111488517
Châlons, where the count’s steamboat waited for them. Without the loss	252.75809713287194
of an instant, the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers	314.86289468600773
embarked without delay. The boat was built for speed; her two	267.6979873095722
paddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like	338.54096533766193
a bird.	296.66590128770736
Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is	360.7479081391043
generally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind	243.02840736554694
which occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the	268.1395520480329
point of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there.	200.66842969315678
As the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost	303.9616748071454
superhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been	325.46790922598274
taken for an exile about to revisit his native land.	228.36805696366343
Ere long Marseilles presented herself to view,—Marseilles, white,	297.71244289788086
fervid, full of life and energy,—Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre	346.88364735635344
and Carthage, the successor to them in the empire of the	348.6829542074071
Mediterranean,—Marseilles, old, yet always young. Powerful memories	192.5223725959733
were stirred within them by the sight of the round tower, Fort	300.33439604314333
Saint-Nicolas, the City Hall designed by Puget,28 the port with its	185.3905547661769
brick quays, where they had both played in childhood, and it was with	212.69363650264177
one accord that they stopped on the Canebière.	258.10230928662054
A vessel was setting sail for Algiers, on board of which the bustle	347.57421029137373
usually attending departure prevailed. The passengers and their	227.36442551917304
relations crowded on the deck, friends taking a tender but sorrowful	179.58550629919972
leave of each other, some weeping, others noisy in their grief, the	361.7811780720439
whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who	258.6832984475385
witnessed similar sights daily, but which had no power to disturb the	243.17529144420138
current of thought that had taken possession of the mind of Maximilian	215.50759161655452
from the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay.	312.6250962338515
“Here,” said he, leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo,—“here is	270.1909169660615
the spot where my father stopped, when the _Pharaon_ entered the port;	331.34301193701515
it was here that the good old man, whom you saved from death and	262.13676306072574
dishonor, threw himself into my arms. I yet feel his warm tears on my	235.1264533593071
face, and his were not the only tears shed, for many who witnessed our	277.92874873348705
meeting wept also.”	175.23956997377658
Monte Cristo gently smiled and said,—“I was there;” at the same time	196.29813988185282
pointing to the corner of a street. As he spoke, and in the very	344.2112767584971
direction he indicated, a groan, expressive of bitter grief, was heard,	300.52863077638074
and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel	197.02576448933084
about to sail. Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that must	293.78981426714915
have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel.	213.62619062832215
“Oh, heavens!” exclaimed Morrel, “I do not deceive myself—that young	179.79066345338995
man who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant,	247.38089021181844
is Albert de Morcerf!”	354.6661628422919
“Yes,” said Monte Cristo, “I recognized him.”	357.0729830777736
“How so?—you were looking the other way.”	277.2778885930462
50209m	203.60073214548402
The count smiled, as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want	245.12422095293152
to make any reply, and he again turned towards the veiled woman, who	207.70939745079284
soon disappeared at the corner of the street. Turning to his friend:	200.59518128965726
“Dear Maximilian,” said the count, “have you nothing to do in this	326.4015937053164
land?”	338.8851526029713
“I have to weep over the grave of my father,” replied Morrel in a	184.17754427666588
broken voice.	220.10873298449079
“Well, then, go,—wait for me there, and I will soon join you.”	228.84808781402353
“You leave me, then?”	205.84929156136653
“Yes; I also have a pious visit to pay.”	172.97547279852137
Morrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to	232.38401114119193
him; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he	290.46823116133976
quitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city. Monte	320.13964985679786
Cristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight; he	352.9447342596654
then walked slowly towards the Allées de Meilhan to seek out a small	175.62352000603994
house with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of	282.89555948108034
this story.	197.9756177068033
It yet stood, under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees, which	363.5273528889194
forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of Marseilles,	308.6792716275445
covered by an immense vine, which spreads its aged and blackened	313.0073446186844
branches over the stone front, burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the	295.7814630253454
south. Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to	224.1474786215021
the door, which was made of three planks; the door had never been	264.0689390901186
painted or varnished, so great cracks yawned in it during the dry	278.49999795083414
season to close again when the rains came on. The house, with all its	273.69881771196856
crumbling antiquity and apparent misery, was yet cheerful and	312.46199876569074
picturesque, and was the same that old Dantès formerly inhabited—the	190.20477407175184
only difference being that the old man occupied merely the garret,	265.60742241334805
while the whole house was now placed at the command of Mercédès by the	301.7168708700899
count.	324.38704756156244
The woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret	211.39286276725912
entered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when	245.4197793588184
Monte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street, so that he found and	198.42645134299426
lost her again almost at the same instant. The worn out steps were old	197.21950935919722
acquaintances of his; he knew better than anyone else how to open that	173.36010207815985
weather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise	193.70510947467722
the latch within. He entered without knocking, or giving any other	340.85710597781963
intimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master of	259.3139008514551
the place. At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little	351.58032655662214
garden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light. In this	284.30932635917316
garden Mercédès had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum	287.9954303258807
of money which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having	316.2809635630943
been placed there twenty-four years previously. The trees of the garden	249.4504207801889
were easily seen from the steps of the street-door.	331.2478560921763
Monte Cristo, on stepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost	274.54736014948446
a deep sob; he looked in the direction whence it came, and there under	264.10126388381593
an arbor of Virginia jessamine,29 with its thick foliage and beautiful	306.153068001217
long purple flowers, he saw Mercédès seated, with her head bowed, and	358.4559994531186
weeping bitterly. She had raised her veil, and with her face hidden by	312.18298941171224
her hands was giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been	175.12460808687837
so long restrained by the presence of her son.	352.78116664971947
Monte Cristo advanced a few steps, which were heard on the gravel.	224.22159786633262
Mercédès raised her head, and uttered a cry of terror on beholding a	260.3911447564765
man before her.	340.5545775882691
50211m	342.48005355143493
“Madame,” said the count, “it is no longer in my power to restore you	248.60370332131814
to happiness, but I offer you consolation; will you deign to accept it	185.81331667103865
as coming from a friend?”	244.8808388430882
“I am, indeed, most wretched,” replied Mercédès. “Alone in the world, I	244.43380573838598
had but my son, and he has left me!”	344.4309265948001
“He possesses a noble heart, madame,” replied the count, “and he has	344.7458095008262
acted rightly. He feels that every man owes a tribute to his country;	318.86661181170643
some contribute their talents, others their industry; these devote	283.1432636768073
their blood, those their nightly labors, to the same cause. Had he	277.59931255027186
remained with you, his life must have become a hateful burden, nor	342.4906396401178
would he have participated in your griefs. He will increase in strength	284.16727013518437
and honor by struggling with adversity, which he will convert into	201.6773228616084
prosperity. Leave him to build up the future for you, and I venture to	305.3061498922518
say you will confide it to safe hands.”	315.4557050628192
“Oh,” replied the wretched woman, mournfully shaking her head, “the	181.8635238723475
prosperity of which you speak, and which, from the bottom of my heart,	201.3123059685489
I pray God in his mercy to grant him, I can never enjoy. The bitter cup	312.35381742164986
of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs, and I feel that	324.75411915885104
the grave is not far distant. You have acted kindly, count, in bringing	261.04422749855735
me back to the place where I have enjoyed so much bliss. I ought to	198.14004661647294
meet death on the same spot where happiness was once all my own.”	204.50723610421227
“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “your words sear and embitter my heart, the	311.81873766987593
more so as you have every reason to hate me. I have been the cause of	301.29130173179624
all your misfortunes; but why do you pity, instead of blaming me? You	207.33148171273618
render me still more unhappy——”	244.18391763503905
“Hate you, blame you—_you_, Edmond! Hate, reproach, the man that has	331.9473913002411
spared my son’s life! For was it not your fatal and sanguinary	267.1913614162312
intention to destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud? Oh,	348.27694709965135
look at me closely, and discover, if you can, even the semblance of a	335.6540648968735
reproach in me.”	336.116541950359
The count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercédès, who arose partly	308.56448569562576
from her seat and extended both her hands towards him.	360.84095273415033
“Oh, look at me,” continued she, with a feeling of profound melancholy,	253.39262268187787
“my eyes no longer dazzle by their brilliancy, for the time has long	332.5510153711657
fled since I used to smile on Edmond Dantès, who anxiously looked out	195.07105025232224
for me from the window of yonder garret, then inhabited by his old	308.87209654442375
father. Years of grief have created an abyss between those days and the	215.81536883910374
present. I neither reproach you nor hate you, my friend. Oh, no,	358.91000328136874
Edmond, it is myself that I blame, myself that I hate! Oh, miserable	262.6281767714429
creature that I am!” cried she, clasping her hands, and raising her	261.37525954780597
eyes to heaven. “I once possessed piety, innocence, and love, the three	244.66283538823674
ingredients of the happiness of angels, and now what am I?”	193.70288793196855
Monte Cristo approached her, and silently took her hand.	171.33750977645207
“No,” said she, withdrawing it gently—“no, my friend, touch me not. You	272.19998593250114
have spared me, yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance I	272.9658933468946
was the most guilty. They were influenced by hatred, by avarice, and by	365.7641497687381
self-love; but I was base, and for want of courage acted against my	227.99962435879527
judgment. Nay, do not press my hand, Edmond; you are thinking, I am	356.0731121961084
sure, of some kind speech to console me, but do not utter it to me,	188.64794459796386
reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness. See” (and she	342.488747256092
exposed her face completely to view)—“see, misfortune has silvered my	276.2607851401951
hair, my eyes have shed so many tears that they are encircled by a rim	229.5806604285923
of purple, and my brow is wrinkled. You, Edmond, on the contrary,—you	289.2482784859094
are still young, handsome, dignified; it is because you have had faith;	369.9472241898492
because you have had strength, because you have had trust in God, and	354.5949661048405
God has sustained you. But as for me, I have been a coward; I have	251.0150224117175
denied God and he has abandoned me.”	345.0482177941563
50213m	309.8752634421596
Mercédès burst into tears; her woman’s heart was breaking under its	208.31334733367484
load of memories. Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on	226.45086973020534
it; but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than	356.64499564403945
he would have bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint.	244.28811765303368
“It often happens,” continued she, “that a first fault destroys the	303.7406455689261
prospects of a whole life. I believed you dead; why did I survive you?	320.0700089108999
What good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret	318.3330792404963
recesses of my heart?—only to make a woman of thirty-nine look like a	182.1768666434335
woman of fifty. Why, having recognized you, and I the only one to do	276.70398591130953
so—why was I able to save my son alone? Ought I not also to have	268.4545719918402
rescued the man that I had accepted for a husband, guilty though he	182.66561289769976
were? Yet I let him die! What do I say? Oh, merciful heavens, was I not	306.76604695982553
accessory to his death by my supine insensibility, by my contempt for	268.6808677038704
him, not remembering, or not willing to remember, that it was for my	253.42982840952868
sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer? In what am I benefited by	186.93270394714617
accompanying my son so far, since I now abandon him, and allow him to	317.4378900627061
depart alone to the baneful climate of Africa? Oh, I have been base,	202.75429377248926
cowardly, I tell you; I have abjured my affections, and like all	214.2837510758988
renegades I am of evil omen to those who surround me!”	227.3054492277495
“No, Mercédès,” said Monte Cristo, “no; you judge yourself with too	220.83572976703923
much severity. You are a noble-minded woman, and it was your grief that	336.57247277719114
disarmed me. Still I was but an agent, led on by an invisible and	317.7101952520363
offended Deity, who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was	341.46693368801255
destined to hurl. I take that God to witness, at whose feet I have	368.1844881321237
prostrated myself daily for the last ten years, that I would have	272.80609409402547
sacrificed my life to you, and with my life the projects that were	330.4864079072932
indissolubly linked with it. But—and I say it with some pride,	300.2031337511517
Mercédès—God needed me, and I lived. Examine the past and the present,	177.79698204743733
and endeavor to dive into futurity, and then say whether I am not a	293.30437663332395
divine instrument. The most dreadful misfortunes, the most frightful	201.88396794840241
sufferings, the abandonment of all those who loved me, the persecution	196.3449737262402
of those who did not know me, formed the trials of my youth; when	285.76873171980145
suddenly, from captivity, solitude, misery, I was restored to light and	327.6350855890655
liberty, and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant, so	324.4197688773128
unbounded, so unheard-of, that I must have been blind not to be	177.35491850520145
conscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great	242.45957110454253
designs. From that time I looked upon this fortune as something	330.27416419655657
confided to me for a particular purpose. Not a thought was given to a	285.0988105246422
life which you once, Mercédès, had the power to render blissful; not	199.17688416634977
one hour of peaceful calm was mine; but I felt myself driven on like an	209.20673655496165
exterminating angel. Like adventurous captains about to embark on some	231.7236579976211
enterprise full of danger, I laid in my provisions, I loaded my	325.2570818263006
weapons, I collected every means of attack and defence; I inured my	203.6722615422936
body to the most violent exercises, my soul to the bitterest trials; I	299.67550623974074
taught my arm to slay, my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings, and	318.8483063790054
my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles. Good-natured,	232.4810462478979
confiding, and forgiving as I had been, I became revengeful, cunning,	285.81182195628196
and wicked, or rather, immovable as fate. Then I launched out into the	322.14366090865497
path that was opened to me. I overcame every obstacle, and reached the	178.78052988032402
goal; but woe to those who stood in my pathway!”	336.73459880166365
50215m	222.9435300905178
“Enough,” said Mercédès; “enough, Edmond! Believe me, that she who	270.94732603213964
alone recognized you has been the only one to comprehend you; and had	172.4321391223482
she crossed your path, and you had crushed her like glass, still,	336.1335804607324
Edmond, still she must have admired you! Like the gulf between me and	195.55550254465211
the past, there is an abyss between you, Edmond, and the rest of	220.46423614653264
mankind; and I tell you freely that the comparison I draw between you	314.98458361353016
and other men will ever be one of my greatest tortures. No, there is	250.652197610765
nothing in the world to resemble you in worth and goodness! But we must	287.75893529899804
say farewell, Edmond, and let us part.”	229.1531652926706
“Before I leave you, Mercédès, have you no request to make?” said the	214.98450180807097
count.	184.44475412504087
“I desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,—the happiness of my	359.9654335537179
son.”	284.06141886045714
“Pray to the Almighty to spare his life, and I will take upon myself to	245.72200841057827
promote his happiness.”	358.9467456147986
“Thank you, Edmond.”	282.6205126575845
“But have you no request to make for yourself, Mercédès?”	355.3594741202503
“For myself I want nothing. I live, as it were, between two graves. One	227.25807960466716
is that of Edmond Dantès, lost to me long, long since. He had my love!	203.67007732398747
That word ill becomes my faded lip now, but it is a memory dear to my	183.42322854128003
heart, and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains.	228.3739675570492
The other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of	316.1931398433064
Edmond Dantès. I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead.”	313.2775969776293
“Your son shall be happy, Mercédès,” repeated the count.	250.59862448438
“Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly	179.46419049413373
confer.”	271.2199074617846
“But what are your intentions?”	242.49247181839337
Mercédès smiled sadly.	191.81420919258665
“To say that I shall live here, like the Mercédès of other times,	175.65245854685276
gaining my bread by labor, would not be true, nor would you believe me.	275.78166997603216
I have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in	273.4351495404878
prayer. However, I shall have no occasion to work, for the little sum	302.8804752993395
of money buried by you, and which I found in the place you mentioned,	268.80767182547004
will be sufficient to maintain me. Rumor will probably be busy	177.96281931348508
respecting me, my occupations, my manner of living—that will signify	247.1710297213556
but little, that concerns God, you, and myself.”	269.87128805244345
“Mercédès,” said the count, “I do not say it to blame you, but you made	367.5590834843453
an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune	359.3223982175017
amassed by M. de Morcerf; half of it at least by right belonged to you,	189.40255408515642
in virtue of your vigilance and economy.”	218.40549305364627
“I perceive what you are intending to propose to me; but I cannot	321.0044524752852
accept it, Edmond—my son would not permit it.”	194.08317599063548
“Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de	179.43895681112724
Morcerf. I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will	199.39131780101624
submit to them. But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you	230.4232699826478
oppose them?”	281.2416287689061
“You well know, Edmond, that I am no longer a reasoning creature; I	346.13961823657826
have no will, unless it be the will never to decide. I have been so	294.6283916712227
overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head, that I am	287.82784527449337
become passive in the hands of the Almighty, like a sparrow in the	219.44894198642453
talons of an eagle. I live, because it is not ordained for me to die.	227.90229270674297
If succor be sent to me, I will accept it.”	200.93548688800064
“Ah, madame,” said Monte Cristo, “you should not talk thus! It is not	360.60840775377136
so we should evince our resignation to the will of heaven; on the	314.93939947121555
contrary, we are all free agents.”	224.94079169910532
“Alas!” exclaimed Mercédès, “if it were so, if I possessed free-will,	259.5668218517842
but without the power to render that will efficacious, it would drive	221.85369339925361
me to despair.”	174.22104109164482
Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence of her	210.41218890838627
grief.	296.69218528976234
“Will you not even say you will see me again?” he asked.	235.32216485965859
“On the contrary, we shall meet again,” said Mercédès, pointing to	297.50475668203006
heaven with solemnity. “I tell you so to prove to you that I still	328.6680698932057
hope.”	292.9958809510302
And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count,	241.29201812240925
Mercédès rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left	326.2892528101796
the house and turned towards the quay. But Mercédès did not witness his	268.5756004527449
departure, although she was seated at the little window of the room	329.99460495386836
which had been occupied by old Dantès. Her eyes were straining to see	307.960521040909
the ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her	346.5444018468597
voice involuntarily murmured softly:	265.7851609841321
“Edmond, Edmond, Edmond!”	323.39647767043675
 Chapter 113. The Past	211.55190799976123
The count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left	220.43003510007193
Mercédès, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little	262.26269139831606
Edward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached	201.12780329966824
the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an	313.24796540026455
abyss of doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation	174.77468791271102
which had just taken place between Mercédès and himself had awakened so	357.917051649717
many recollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat	173.6600314726006
with them. A man of the count’s temperament could not long indulge in	352.256605256419
that melancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys	177.49564430302843
superior ones. He thought he must have made an error in his	285.6603855132147
calculations if he now found cause to blame himself.	222.75916468917973
“I cannot have deceived myself,” he said; “I must look upon the past in	199.533491830947
a false light. What!” he continued, “can I have been following a false	172.5548014368249
path?—can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?—can one hour have	242.3588587278323
sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which he founded	205.91627899283023
all his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious, undertaking? I	336.75879652181624
cannot reconcile myself to this idea—it would madden me. The reason why	361.1661356668719
I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear appreciation of the	186.00911759533483
past. The past, like the country through which we walk, becomes	235.6571295043243
indistinct as we advance. My position is like that of a person wounded	183.1177186192163
in a dream; he feels the wound, though he cannot recollect when he	185.9138673477687
received it.	206.48580561304607
“Come, then, thou regenerate man, thou extravagant prodigal, thou	326.37761824162044
awakened sleeper, thou all-powerful visionary, thou invincible	314.51051130088456
millionaire,—once again review thy past life of starvation and	369.14229224551354
wretchedness, revisit the scenes where fate and misfortune conducted,	202.8122397910552
and where despair received thee. Too many diamonds, too much gold and	296.16137798113624
splendor, are now reflected by the mirror in which Monte Cristo seeks	199.70614458992637
to behold Dantès. Hide thy diamonds, bury thy gold, shroud thy	322.2109442361059
splendor, exchange riches for poverty, liberty for a prison, a living	245.69338173596705
body for a corpse!”	196.55731674873465
As he thus reasoned, Monte Cristo walked down the Rue de la Caisserie.	180.19399313162057
It was the same through which, twenty-four years ago, he had been	302.35975801403754
conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard; the houses, today so smiling	360.2536389805466
and animated, were on that night dark, mute, and closed.	345.18763076194796
“And yet they were the same,” murmured Monte Cristo, “only now it is	186.78667039273805
broad daylight instead of night; it is the sun which brightens the	201.57781861854102
place, and makes it appear so cheerful.”	197.25463297462593
He proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to	174.52386758539092
the Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked. A pleasure-boat	350.0053203505165
with striped awning was going by. Monte Cristo called the owner, who	288.5690538761299
immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for	370.5407663695445
a good fare.	247.66700404468662
The weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat. The sun, red	347.53488893602025
and flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean. The	266.0761373536667
sea, smooth as crystal, was now and then disturbed by the leaping of	192.2951798909237
fish, which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for safety in	244.42067245998174
another element; while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be	263.8630099941698
seen the fishermen’s boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull, or the	244.4076794261157
merchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain.	308.44885462216536
But notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and	262.4123807829405
the golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of	242.83747038647203
Monte Cristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible	268.8000876682071
voyage, the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory.	172.38493579496318
The solitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the	369.18400346983117
Château d’If, which told him whither they were leading him; the	313.45304960242265
struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard;	366.986687097314
his despair when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when	271.5847460488103
the muzzle of the carbine touched his forehead—all these were brought	325.671924953198
before him in vivid and frightful reality.	263.92057708700247
Like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up, and which	256.10398454164306
after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop, so did	320.3692616804483
the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which	295.3343155475935
formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantès. Clear sky, swift-flitting	289.1713381829905
boats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the heavens were hung with	185.55581534854466
black, and the gigantic structure of the Château d’If seemed like the	316.30500453378124
phantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the shore, the count	361.6537057886014
instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat, and the owner was	302.188192040485
obliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice:	200.92985734747322
“Sir, we are at the landing.”	350.9628487058328
Monte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he	201.92898410446057
had been violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the	302.7803917392331
slope at the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long	201.09975417047244
to Dantès, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the	310.1499308431381
oar seemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the	333.566517127548
flying spray of the sea.	218.81095945772267
50219m	360.99605825488953
There had been no prisoners confined in the Château d’If since the	368.8448431197596
revolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for	278.21685739955774
the prevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit	203.9660988834785
to visitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror.	189.479287645885
The count inquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there;	233.24154465802286
but they had all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other	253.3628762087186
employment. The concierge who attended him had only been there since	234.50243096826648
1830. He visited his own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly	246.79999857983705
endeavoring to penetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the	273.66206525891255
spot where had stood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed	301.14732671479754
the new stones indicated where the breach made by the Abbé Faria had	180.11372291460196
been. Monte Cristo felt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log	357.2884867288309
of wood.	313.7111803305776
“Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one	343.32061359986517
relating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?” asked the count; “are there any	271.33475158224337
traditions respecting these dismal abodes,—in which it is difficult to	202.530354767408
believe men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?”	321.85343629405804
“Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this	320.6622560228926
very dungeon.”	219.48818655289045
Monte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost	341.4605048435201
forgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled	351.38040856707056
his person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing	269.52915961783145
the brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still	205.85415259957688
seemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the	313.63203035118636
corridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.	211.47655505521118
“Would you like to hear the story, sir?”	312.1614249445587
“Yes; relate it,” said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to	319.78957370949263
still its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.	355.4292862711742
“This dungeon,” said the concierge, “was, it appears, some time ago	366.52616119963704
occupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of	265.06382941252457
industry. Another person was confined in the Château at the same time,	319.7793845241676
but he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest.”	258.6755094811683
“Ah, indeed?—mad!” repeated Monte Cristo; “and what was his mania?”	260.9471615692637
“He offered millions to anyone who would set him at liberty.”	259.9758088591934
Monte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there	362.46877211174353
was a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there	323.6091829123806
had been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria	266.62214181944216
offered the treasures.	211.49928291148768
“Could the prisoners see each other?” he asked.	194.9400769830035
“Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance	217.07110165847638
of the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.”	190.35546591193207
“And which of them made this passage?”	345.4781190651219
“Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and	329.6663389478283
industrious, while the abbé was aged and weak; besides, his mind was	316.53904088244303
too vacillating to allow him to carry out an idea.”	238.68634247582233
“Blind fools!” murmured the count.	248.39952357439103
“However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by	316.3206641994817
what means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet	210.95809026015422
remaining of his work. Do you see it?” and the man held the torch to	352.59561184071777
the wall.	270.05910047398
50223m	262.39488835179554
“Ah, yes; I see,” said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.	298.0988316525717
“The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how	354.8502003955427
long they did so, nobody knows. One day the old man fell ill and died.	255.73886359544048
Now guess what the young one did?”	271.540215307264
“Tell me.”	296.9303890736797
“He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its	332.7565787468663
face to the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the	314.9453084811007
entrance, and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead body.	198.59053814907452
Did you ever hear of such an idea?”	288.206781145962
Monte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again to experience all the	270.50209526515823
sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas, yet moist with the cold	175.56886828861803
dews of death, had touched his face.	198.3733730109714
The jailer continued:	294.4271523046141
“Now this was his project. He fancied that they buried the dead at the	350.9426748928822
Château d’If, and imagining they would not expend much labor on the	233.49206705872882
grave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with his	270.7080064852295
shoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Château	253.86143376389498
frustrated his projects. They never buried the dead; they merely	314.73619804270106
attached a heavy cannon-ball to the feet, and then threw them into the	217.7889265521558
sea. This is what was done. The young man was thrown from the top of	181.2261021257989
the rock; the corpse was found on the bed next day, and the whole truth	213.41152444768426
was guessed, for the men who performed the office then mentioned what	369.21094138022943
they had not dared to speak of before, that at the moment the corpse	235.64772977047548
was thrown into the deep, they heard a shriek, which was almost	367.5433653561124
immediately stifled by the water in which it disappeared.”	275.5448566870142
The count breathed with difficulty; the cold drops ran down his	284.03459597094667
forehead, and his heart was full of anguish.	272.42537408796693
“No,” he muttered, “the doubt I felt was but the commencement of	193.3984187366533
forgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts	260.44802671464583
for vengeance. And the prisoner,” he continued aloud, “was he ever	291.43250457663146
heard of afterwards?”	217.36661070574303
“Oh, no; of course not. You can understand that one of two things must	311.05677352913034
have happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow,	237.39379869890234
from a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he	206.46108314783046
must have fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to	213.89954386569488
the bottom, where he remained—poor fellow!”	341.9494871781242
“Then you pity him?” said the count.	225.21530783958454
“_Ma foi_, yes; though he was in his own element.”	350.708601467133
“What do you mean?”	264.50082898145797
“The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined	305.37364526078477
for plotting with the Bonapartists.”	190.8013203838574
“Great is truth,” muttered the count, “fire cannot burn, nor water	317.3999397389739
drown it! Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who	256.8131330225278
narrate his history; his terrible story is recited in the	317.24734125335675
chimney-corner, and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit	258.4828882076521
through the air to be swallowed by the deep.” Then, the count added	289.8233768820345
aloud, “Was his name ever known?”	349.96427384414585
“Oh, yes; but only as No. 34.”	329.5505865143349
“Oh, Villefort, Villefort,” murmured the count, “this scene must often	320.6675781043269
have haunted thy sleepless hours!”	206.33089559702307
“Do you wish to see anything more, sir?” said the concierge.	336.57584142278455
“Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbé’s room.”	286.5663568029286
“Ah! No. 27.”	277.39158776864485
“Yes; No. 27.” repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the	260.0560207789547
abbé answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his	229.5008606318316
name.	334.54059413977393
“Come, sir.”	198.38310992149806
“Wait,” said Monte Cristo, “I wish to take one final glance around this	311.5933200609403
room.”	356.1508675175925
“This is fortunate,” said the guide; “I have forgotten the other key.”	249.057055605409
“Go and fetch it.”	241.86164325712753
“I will leave you the torch, sir.”	172.40154579184212
“No, take it away; I can see in the dark.”	254.86680066596904
“Why, you are like No. 34. They said he was so accustomed to darkness	239.33847030399855
that he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon.”	268.40205272397975
“He spent fourteen years to arrive at that,” muttered the count.	230.12685567827918
The guide carried away the torch. The count had spoken correctly.	234.14707437467132
Scarcely had a few seconds elapsed, ere he saw everything as distinctly	345.44992300856467
as by daylight. Then he looked around him, and really recognized his	173.6885432201859
dungeon.	302.36549019425036
“Yes,” he said, “there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is	263.8670050471187
the impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of	282.5189408246041
my blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall. Oh, those	298.8500457747758
figures, how well I remember them! I made them one day to calculate the	357.83663194467056
age of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still	252.811898844192
living, and that of Mercédès, to know if I should find her still free.	309.0480414404006
After finishing that calculation, I had a minute’s hope. I did not	189.61576479087884
reckon upon hunger and infidelity!” and a bitter laugh escaped the	357.5722394359559
count.	197.82605017053416
He saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of Mercédès.	206.711074177115
On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription, the white	315.4654850171048
letters of which were still visible on the green wall:	346.64009138791016
“‘_Oh, God!_’” he read, “‘_preserve my memory!_’”	244.84468647358756
“Oh, yes,” he cried, “that was my only prayer at last; I no longer	306.5593121144433
begged for liberty, but memory; I dreaded to become mad and forgetful.	186.4514958589802
Oh, God, thou hast preserved my memory; I thank thee, I thank thee!”	250.38700139141974
At this moment the light of the torch was reflected on the wall; the	289.5276709162496
guide was coming; Monte Cristo went to meet him.	294.78481783029883
“Follow me, sir;” and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted	340.3631797554946
him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance. There, again, Monte	311.7372148341601
Cristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts. The first thing that	199.61481573497485
met his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbé on the wall, by which	266.2281786017088
he calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which the	253.2975866522365
poor prisoner had died. The sight of this, instead of exciting the	296.63004637600363
anguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with	333.89272147117526
a soft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.	284.2562576023869
“This is where the mad abbé was kept, sir, and that is where the young	340.52743042600423
man entered;” and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained	206.30479554486212
unclosed. “From the appearance of the stone,” he continued, “a learned	333.8078726818056
gentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated	183.42293480044927
together for ten years. Poor things! Those must have been ten weary	214.6778903957718
years.”	275.8450287936657
Dantès took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who	197.04418771778327
had twice unconsciously pitied him. The guide took them, thinking them	188.89502820092562
merely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch	268.0093129410305
revealed their true worth.	189.6784416924528
“Sir,” he said, “you have made a mistake; you have given me gold.”	322.3726456585273
“I know it.”	222.81363855703324
The concierge looked upon the count with surprise.	259.53643817336837
“Sir,” he cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune—“sir, I	216.3176821001182
cannot understand your generosity!”	300.86108753453107
“Oh, it is very simple, my good fellow; I have been a sailor, and your	224.49068360851518
story touched me more than it would others.”	328.6047745936439
“Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something.”	224.06485398489576
50227m	277.63797616383886
“What have you to offer to me, my friend? Shells? Straw-work? Thank	252.16749333831314
you!”	215.45225337502654
“No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.”	183.37547253820023
“Really? What is it?”	309.9390614095617
“Listen,” said the guide; “I said to myself, ‘Something is always left	253.60032376795556
in a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years,’ so I began to	242.7320552579091
sound the wall.”	293.7202890320996
“Ah,” cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbé’s two hiding-places.	212.07973057951526
“After some search, I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the	272.91454029863445
head of the bed, and at the hearth.”	326.8521475229068
“Yes,” said the count, “yes.”	277.49608046533956
“I raised the stones, and found——”	213.7547503540457
“A rope-ladder and some tools?”	204.66525898157494
“How do you know that?” asked the guide in astonishment.	266.3887500389132
“I do not know—I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally	321.73742927812145
found in prisoners’ cells.”	240.02591174632948
“Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.”	247.26365985019834
“And have you them yet?”	339.27583821682055
“No, sir; I sold them to visitors, who considered them great	185.64951269810112
curiosities; but I have still something left.”	316.0012370795473
“What is it?” asked the count, impatiently.	295.9147738073963
“A sort of book, written upon strips of cloth.”	264.4832511067872
“Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do	333.6405398547969
well.”	248.2282671066955
“I will run for it, sir;” and the guide went out.	300.4323174570452
Then the count knelt down by the side of the bed, which death had	329.1368852973087
converted into an altar.	365.56412305383026
“Oh, second father,” he exclaimed, “thou who hast given me liberty,	331.2658663691494
knowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to	252.13096639131209
ourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the	184.6553972087196
depths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can	368.0709805167311
respond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the	235.15662055877903
soul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,—then,	248.2950169680705
noble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love	246.29873533030636
thou didst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me	322.62483374283124
some sign, some revelation! Remove from me the remains of doubt, which,	277.57126590647374
if it change not to conviction, must become remorse!” The count bowed	363.0953368074214
his head, and clasped his hands together.	173.1977586742567
“Here, sir,” said a voice behind him.	327.3510635701815
Monte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of	218.88691617062517
cloth upon which the Abbé Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The	296.4176634040792
manuscript was the great work by the Abbé Faria upon the kingdoms of	193.39430222722544
Italy. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the	283.56183576592554
epigraph, and he read:	180.2262767066077
“Thou shalt tear out the dragons’ teeth, and shall trample the lions	326.5359024975835
under foot, saith the Lord.”	187.82138890164066
“Ah,” he exclaimed, “here is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks.” And	324.98234397082206
feeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which	255.23442034796471
contained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000 francs.	290.95954138166155
“Here,” he said, “take this pocket-book.”	293.72236202324336
“Do you give it to me?”	298.5305276594455
“Yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;”	244.8307607106706
and placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was	215.23675032172892
more valuable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the	344.89849119593447
corridor, and reaching his boat, cried, “To Marseilles!”	211.9920704561349
Then, as he departed, he fixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison.	280.44836670919665
“Woe,” he cried, “to those who confined me in that wretched prison; and	171.94081525027315
woe to those who forgot that I was there!”	249.40147030326278
50229m	370.94323442573875
As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and burying his	237.63938962312153
head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman. The victory was	291.12350480358043
complete; twice he had overcome his doubts. The name he pronounced, in	241.35341179294718
a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love, was that of Haydée.	178.5872762377208
On landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure	283.53211599248067
of finding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a	323.1436460340615
tomb, and sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions,	306.7313730056394
had been unable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from	198.72259822240375
hunger. Morrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had	314.09164519814
fallen down and the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old	252.31972804206237
wood in the churchyard.	179.70382146633625
The worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the arms of his	318.6045764736866
children, he had been by them laid by the side of his wife, who had	332.3142108246648
preceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of marble, on	180.84616095296445
which were inscribed their names, were placed on either side of a	315.6349768577106
little enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees. Morrel	362.91108844445966
was leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes on the	258.51634597465255
graves. His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.	370.1946692310258
50231m	173.47221963829625
“Maximilian,” said the count, “you should not look on the graves, but	190.7194000017806
there;” and he pointed upwards.	258.2517170124909
“The dead are everywhere,” said Morrel; “did you not yourself tell me	260.17439970175434
so as we left Paris?”	299.60140390163605
“Maximilian,” said the count, “you asked me during the journey to allow	270.632899525263
you to remain some days at Marseilles. Do you still wish to do so?”	185.82615586920357
“I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less	295.5385897426249
painfully here than anywhere else.”	313.6853902626143
“So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with	223.59914475143125
me, do I not?”	251.26441968001154
“Ah, count, I shall forget it.”	313.1548454966651
“No, you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor, Morrel,	235.07490420068382
because you have taken an oath, and are about to do so again.”	365.3053603613961
“Oh, count, have pity upon me. I am so unhappy.”	314.10185751244694
“I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel.”	310.4559388894153
“Impossible!”	292.36334970063933
“Alas,” said Monte Cristo, “it is the infirmity of our nature always to	369.8627168629948
believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!”	241.31433472478466
“What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and	184.90704447280507
desired in the world?”	179.1931844575408
“Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I	310.9737201259479
knew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a	280.13921109317926
woman. He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed	224.75872405496995
bride whom he adored. He was about to marry her, when one of the	252.3306037456628
caprices of fate,—which would almost make us doubt the goodness of	200.7712424311792
Providence, if that Providence did not afterwards reveal itself by	198.36125158666667
proving that all is but a means of conducting to an end,—one of those	337.25219962218165
caprices deprived him of his mistress, of the future of which he had	196.24749174390416
dreamed (for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the	355.17080001497425
present), and cast him into a dungeon.”	175.95380145702765
“Ah,” said Morrel, “one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.”	268.61406687444793
“He remained there fourteen years, Morrel,” said the count, placing his	204.62943499026738
hand on the young man’s shoulder. Maximilian shuddered.	208.1882046515563
“Fourteen years!” he muttered.	321.23475135839647
“Fourteen years!” repeated the count. “During that time he had many	213.22654358171403
moments of despair. He also, Morrel, like you, considered himself the	281.09632009934853
unhappiest of men.”	351.378951547357
“Well?” asked Morrel.	330.14573591411977
“Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human	178.1838775264074
means. At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of	337.239447695877
the Lord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he	176.1783081174879
miraculously left the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first	277.4550400672805
cry was for his father; but that father was dead.”	227.5815085006217
“My father, too, is dead,” said Morrel.	349.3154317271876
“Yes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and	304.63282025287
full of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of	276.3659792710921
Providence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his	240.77337334086093
tomb had disappeared, and no one could say, ‘There sleeps the father	199.6301253637172
you so well loved.’”	314.80979114074154
“Oh!” exclaimed Morrel.	237.51505262719093
“He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not	289.37723214921624
even find his father’s grave.”	252.96880198991778
“But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?”	253.82710754395322
“You are deceived, Morrel, that woman——”	225.44573375143614
“She was dead?”	351.78536032710895
“Worse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the	172.90770953428506
persecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more	245.30598105690098
unhappy lover than you.”	201.31558664085742
“And has he found consolation?”	204.5893615941635
“He has at least found peace.”	252.1651564585784
“And does he ever expect to be happy?”	230.13304546959483
“He hopes so, Maximilian.”	273.0006332162682
The young man’s head fell on his breast.	246.31438453513832
“You have my promise,” he said, after a minute’s pause, extending his	303.13229351971495
hand to Monte Cristo. “Only remember——”	229.5099680186916
“On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of	195.19270203548967
Monte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of	216.0845853031932
Bastia, it will be called the _Eurus_. You will give your name to the	369.908883904249
captain, who will bring you to me. It is understood—is it not?”	175.5401676856275
“But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October——”	233.7151119829647
“Child,” replied the count, “not to know the value of a man’s word! I	206.0274172325455
have told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day, I will	182.13944073651038
assist you. Morrel, farewell!”	188.32171508598083
“Do you leave me?”	251.6465143372895
“Yes; I have business in Italy. I leave you alone in your struggle with	335.1795153015978
misfortune—alone with that strong-winged eagle which God sends to bear	250.96571444982803
aloft the elect to his feet. The story of Ganymede, Maximilian, is not	354.2728693546356
a fable, but an allegory.”	369.0470726324607
“When do you leave?”	287.5610816867614
“Immediately; the steamer waits, and in an hour I shall be far from	340.68947953155265
you. Will you accompany me to the harbor, Maximilian?”	258.6635081593719
50233m	260.3218200011908
“I am entirely yours, count.”	267.48809544999847
Morrel accompanied the count to the harbor. The white steam was	230.88409385133667
ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney. The steamer	214.63834612781858
soon disappeared, and in an hour afterwards, as the count had said, was	290.40858545186245
scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the night.	312.36929478597153
 Chapter 114. Peppino	275.4957640804826
At the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgiou, a	369.55295316139
man travelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed	173.78482997895435
the little town of Aquapendente. He was travelling fast enough to cover	233.44034452070537
a great deal of ground without exciting suspicion. This man was dressed	188.94104867784964
in a greatcoat, or rather a surtout, a little worse for the journey,	202.20493675676778
but which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and	370.72625767673776
brilliant, a decoration which also ornamented the under coat. He might	366.96458879588045
be recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with	208.69447027621794
which he spoke to the postilion, as a Frenchman.	200.14889361057635
Another proof that he was a native of the universal country was	222.0830717752426
apparent in the fact of his knowing no other Italian words than the	303.375324081211
terms used in music, and which like the “goddam” of Figaro, served all	295.43478275830626
possible linguistic requirements. “_Allegro!_” he called out to the	364.15783349448077
postilions at every ascent. “_Moderato!_” he cried as they descended.	223.2050402290525
And heaven knows there are hills enough between Rome and Florence by	193.22215393185425
the way of Aquapendente! These two words greatly amused the men to whom	266.6949988610325
they were addressed. On reaching La Storta, the point from whence Rome	299.01012514543095
is first visible, the traveller evinced none of the enthusiastic	240.5265016324659
curiosity which usually leads strangers to stand up and endeavor to	288.1398145395005
catch sight of the dome of Saint Peter’s, which may be seen long before	294.8848101956427
any other object is distinguishable. No, he merely drew a pocketbook	305.8446097563409
from his pocket, and took from it a paper folded in four, and after	229.83472814841724
having examined it in a manner almost reverential, he said:	314.01211700624515
“Good! I have it still!”	232.58363224523112
50235m	243.224416823454
The carriage entered by the Porta del Popolo, turned to the left, and	263.04693987474366
stopped at the Hôtel d’Espagne. Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance,	325.05606702111805
received the traveller at the door, hat in hand. The traveller	267.55256091671697
alighted, ordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house	226.05086970099117
of Thomson & French, which was immediately given to him, as it was one	305.4585884351514
of the most celebrated in Rome. It was situated in the Via dei Banchi,	323.4524756257457
near St. Peter’s.	258.44954354967365
In Rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an event.	286.5689908281476
Ten young descendants of Marius and the Gracchi, barefooted and out at	290.5276079301732
elbows, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully	301.61728297451964
curved above the head, stared at the traveller, the post-chaise, and	190.11805917221398
the horses; to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the	217.6764586675406
Papal States, who earned a pittance by diving into the Tiber at high	231.19688030253937
water from the bridge of St. Angelo. Now, as these street Arabs of	209.82356879088684
Rome, more fortunate than those of Paris, understand every language,	241.11281826708228
more especially the French, they heard the traveller order an	190.12021696856755
apartment, a dinner, and finally inquire the way to the house of	273.3944693106515
Thomson & French.	245.0989526441299
The result was that when the new-comer left the hotel with the	308.35139887053003
_cicerone_, a man detached himself from the rest of the idlers, and	208.7517727117106
without having been seen by the traveller, and appearing to excite no	209.61911127870658
attention from the guide, followed the stranger with as much skill as a	206.70311262293174
Parisian police agent would have used.	288.5154214628837
The Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson &	353.59781578116963
French that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed, but left	234.48666271662904
word for the carriage to overtake him on the road, or to wait for him	196.60166469269126
at the bankers’ door. He reached it before the carriage arrived. The	269.96796310831905
Frenchman entered, leaving in the anteroom his guide, who immediately	251.46743661970712
entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers	247.18578322045272
who are always to be found in Rome at the doors of banking-houses,	296.243554812738
churches, museums, or theatres. With the Frenchman, the man who had	366.988659307202
followed him entered too; the Frenchman knocked at the inner door, and	315.6571780265554
entered the first room; his shadow did the same.	261.3209396378715
“Messrs. Thomson & French?” inquired the stranger.	286.3002498223751
An attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first	361.91482182590175
desk.	201.8967431638695
“Whom shall I announce?” said the attendant.	250.53943591067087
“Baron Danglars.”	365.1031858097433
“Follow me,” said the man.	233.1106046190575
A door opened, through which the attendant and the baron disappeared.	300.03915544403344
The man who had followed Danglars sat down on a bench. The clerk	207.70243077968806
continued to write for the next five minutes; the man preserved	181.69594777871922
profound silence, and remained perfectly motionless. Then the pen of	330.40029118179893
the clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head, and	230.74505624951613
appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy:	306.21812377523133
“Ah, ha,” he said, “here you are, Peppino!”	220.20099255644115
“Yes,” was the laconic reply. “You have found out that there is	253.2633464369753
something worth having about this large gentleman?”	302.76484746432254
“There is no great merit due to me, for we were informed of it.”	191.00411505367433
“You know his business here, then.”	343.12724198766546
“_Pardieu_, he has come to draw, but I don’t know how much!”	184.25480449929066
“You will know presently, my friend.”	329.94013172201255
“Very well, only do not give me false information as you did the other	266.2716227105677
day.”	244.59454169516243
“What do you mean?—of whom do you speak? Was it the Englishman who	302.75287447343834
carried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?”	333.6997731568456
50237m	343.68388245497215
“No; he really had 3,000 crowns, and we found them. I mean the Russian	274.2640061037518
prince, who you said had 30,000 livres, and we only found 22,000.”	226.11042232081792
“You must have searched badly.”	330.5762073877164
“Luigi Vampa himself searched.”	221.54886414253377
“In that case he must either have paid his debts——”	252.0950363138449
“A Russian do that?”	273.9590562512128
“Or spent the money?”	210.2513254861663
“Possibly, after all.”	260.5988758027961
“Certainly. But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman	182.5766617163254
will transact his business without my knowing the sum.”	333.22801612231945
Peppino nodded, and taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a	274.75641174960936
few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same door by which	259.9420267618218
Danglars and the attendant had gone out. At the expiration of ten	305.80017491043117
minutes the clerk returned with a beaming countenance.	241.88174650433956
“Well?” asked Peppino of his friend.	221.91241165514137
“Joy, joy—the sum is large!”	295.2143157377882
“Five or six millions, is it not?”	172.85546408084002
“Yes, you know the amount.”	174.9255598896094
“On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo?”	193.21512930933716
“Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?”	273.4152192501577
“I told you we were informed beforehand.”	173.29315870739237
“Then why do you apply to me?”	344.7188448085986
“That I may be sure I have the right man.”	368.2961425906701
“Yes, it is indeed he. Five millions—a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?”	228.11762271441563
“Hush—here is our man!” The clerk seized his pen, and Peppino his	292.2109519016192
beads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened.	276.2116289971306
Danglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the	184.98444132462637
door. Peppino followed Danglars.	252.4031438796711
According to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door.	258.1703894836528
The guide held the door open. Guides are useful people, who will turn	200.89719427427752
their hands to anything. Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young	321.7655763193353
man of twenty. The _cicerone_ reclosed the door, and sprang up by the	240.1497528719772
side of the coachman. Peppino mounted the seat behind.	284.61226677555965
“Will your excellency visit Saint Peter’s?” asked the _cicerone_.	171.77818616276028
“I did not come to Rome to see,” said Danglars aloud; then he added	368.1078404671141
softly, with an avaricious smile, “I came to touch!” and he rapped his	257.63952731351657
pocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter.	221.25446422641056
“Then your excellency is going——”	337.79986053593444
“To the hotel.”	360.13831177468376
“Casa Pastrini!” said the _cicerone_ to the coachman, and the carriage	347.93036306359954
drove rapidly on.	214.45208478603087
50239m	324.85332332969904
Ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his apartment, and Peppino	290.40861316026985
stationed himself on the bench outside the door of the hotel, after	177.54519409559995
having whispered something in the ear of one of the descendants of	330.95672312664396
Marius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the chapter,	268.2665332848702
who immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol at his fullest	339.70126885573984
speed. Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went to bed, placing	322.9310195939796
his pocketbook under his pillow. Peppino had a little spare time, so he	178.44744521018094
had a game of _morra_ with the facchini, lost three crowns, and then to	271.6504165429721
console himself drank a bottle of Orvieto.	301.8407895095896
The next morning Danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early;	296.73256692580793
he had not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at	197.58920170318686
all. He breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the	212.64692092598443
beauties of the Eternal City, ordered post-horses at noon. But Danglars	363.1173964752834
had not reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of	292.47274510155256
the posting-master. The horses only arrived at two o’clock, and the	230.1389994918884
_cicerone_ did not bring the passport till three.	279.5631423762593
All these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door	351.1548395679657
of Signor Pastrini’s; the descendants of Marius and the Gracchi were	202.27546197387963
also not wanting. The baron walked triumphantly through the crowd, who	252.5733675265053
for the sake of gain styled him “your excellency.” As Danglars had	331.9618705947555
hitherto contented himself with being called a baron, he felt rather	328.55393240204705
flattered at the title of excellency, and distributed a dozen silver	310.00096272793064
coins among the beggars, who were ready, for twelve more, to call him	292.4081536808571
“your highness.”	297.99280755354994
“Which road?” asked the postilion in Italian.	343.5687499516216
“The Ancona road,” replied the baron. Signor Pastrini interpreted the	176.61767773305485
question and answer, and the horses galloped off.	232.75134260220258
Danglars intended travelling to Venice, where he would receive one part	335.86605297964434
of his fortune, and then proceeding to Vienna, where he would find the	300.8594576758227
rest, he meant to take up his residence in the latter town, which he	245.568807800585
had been told was a city of pleasure.	233.26371378936037
He had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began	288.22275333524465
to disappear. Danglars had not intended starting so late, or he would	192.52312409491284
have remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long it	284.43768210972286
would be before they reached the next town. “_Non capisco_” (do not	286.8651876379084
understand), was the reply. Danglars bent his head, which he meant to	237.6968012109461
imply, “Very well.” The carriage again moved on.	297.4122025216497
“I will stop at the first posting-house,” said Danglars to himself.	303.21977987218713
He still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the	251.7237541326591
previous evening, and which had procured him so good a night’s rest. He	325.90241537522473
was luxuriously stretched in a good English calash, with double	283.6789468599848
springs; he was drawn by four good horses, at full gallop; he knew the	306.2337198295094
relay to be at a distance of seven leagues. What subject of meditation	265.08041006993517
could present itself to the banker, so fortunately become bankrupt?	292.54591912425013
Danglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in Paris; another ten	215.54898824129296
minutes about his daughter travelling with Mademoiselle d’Armilly; the	229.16272106377198
same period was given to his creditors, and the manner in which he	315.82480939236154
intended spending their money; and then, having no subject left for	171.11120184541778
contemplation, he shut his eyes, and fell asleep. Now and then a jolt	219.1534108399223
more violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt	333.9868213889228
that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same	196.55044110043247
country, thickly strewn with broken aqueducts, which looked like	258.6728050979226
granite giants petrified while running a race. But the night was cold,	179.13280560891238
dull, and rainy, and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to	241.24543520890734
remain in the warm carriage than to put his head out of the window to	334.067991812474
make inquiries of a postilion whose only answer was “_Non capisco_.”	257.10538275644916
50241m	367.45722068886073
Danglars therefore continued to sleep, saying to himself that he would	249.28439108418212
be sure to awake at the posting-house. The carriage stopped. Danglars	190.3777047919642
fancied that they had reached the long-desired point; he opened his	277.29518132084115
eyes and looked through the window, expecting to find himself in the	282.6906665654163
midst of some town, or at least village; but he saw nothing except what	292.5257192194664
seemed like a ruin, where three or four men went and came like shadows.	342.7346284195067
Danglars waited a moment, expecting the postilion to come and demand	233.67036934172702
payment with the termination of his stage. He intended taking advantage	289.1852787002312
of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but	333.9204470711858
the horses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without	235.40410715809412
anyone claiming money from the traveller. Danglars, astonished, opened	202.34841151822803
the door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled	361.5646732442943
on. The baron was completely roused.	283.9649091336919
“Eh?” he said to the postilion, “eh, _mio caro?_”	352.3063718210112
This was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from	322.9751881177404
hearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalcanti. But _mio caro_	226.9421836136824
did not reply. Danglars then opened the window.	221.40510149094337
“Come, my friend,” he said, thrusting his hand through the opening,	289.81575096417487
“where are we going?”	311.9094551825488
“_Dentro la testa!_” answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied	304.04898344249955
by a menacing gesture.	328.48969242487635
Danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant, “Put in your head!” He was	223.6725526168507
making rapid progress in Italian. He obeyed, not without some	264.637479150986
uneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead of	340.79505029907597
being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with	263.9725652404243
ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially	225.81678741074563
one in such a situation as Danglars. His eyes acquired that quality	333.5873860641077
which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see	316.48955655675627
distinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed.	223.03186701467456
Before we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see	190.99201823346155
double; and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble.	270.3535255128319
Danglars observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the	356.5487031670334
carriage.	193.77577541162034
“Some gendarme!” he exclaimed. “Can I have been intercepted by French	246.69776519194215
telegrams to the pontifical authorities?”	323.51540759099976
He resolved to end his anxiety. “Where are you taking me?” he asked.	282.30256418915076
“_Dentro la testa_,” replied the same voice, with the same menacing	286.1741240505077
accent.	200.226130129105
Danglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping on	243.33802190172457
that side.	367.7869766695985
“Decidedly,” said Danglars, with the perspiration on his forehead, “I	199.93803867065657
must be under arrest.” And he threw himself back in the calash, not	221.5487197483213
this time to sleep, but to think.	353.14836640353326
Directly afterwards the moon rose. He then saw the great aqueducts,	265.81112911675393
those stone phantoms which he had before remarked, only then they were	325.3031141179955
on the right hand, now they were on the left. He understood that they	220.85919099497488
had described a circle, and were bringing him back to Rome.	335.70933026413945
“Oh, unfortunate!” he cried, “they must have obtained my arrest.”	353.68033522577286
The carriage continued to roll on with frightful speed. An hour of	348.0290422845546
terror elapsed, for every spot they passed showed that they were on the	272.6904685501465
road back. At length he saw a dark mass, against which it seemed as if	177.46027200524765
the carriage was about to dash; but the vehicle turned to one side,	320.3505435230477
leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw that it was one of the	343.03608319867175
ramparts encircling Rome.	205.91073296289943
50243m	205.59377290826527
“_Mon dieu!_” cried Danglars, “we are not returning to Rome; then it is	369.90396269546363
not justice which is pursuing me! Gracious heavens; another idea	247.51949303987584
presents itself—what if they should be——”	297.8992853833476
His hair stood on end. He remembered those interesting stories, so	308.1908167026037
little believed in Paris, respecting Roman bandits; he remembered the	210.17759883474264
adventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that	353.9353111582793
he should marry Mademoiselle Eugénie. “They are robbers, perhaps,” he	174.42220063053972
muttered.	299.0936819961016
Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road.	268.67479383134133
Danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived	336.5905979443634
monuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details	237.68803174858422
Morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt	264.5324073174224
sure that he must be on the Appian Way. On the left, in a sort of	336.10597621124543
valley, he perceived a circular excavation. It was Caracalla’s circus.	210.65223908435607
On a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it	194.55807613219253
stopped. At the same time the door was opened. “_Scendi!_” exclaimed a	173.43061423438684
commanding voice.	209.04642131488072
Danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak Italian, he	224.34592095735078
understood it very well. More dead than alive, he looked around him.	364.92547157249635
Four men surrounded him, besides the postilion.	262.1443919033324
“_Di quà_,” said one of the men, descending a little path leading out	198.04960829915873
of the Appian Way. Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and	239.45393119722814
had no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were	180.43789787496607
following him. Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal	317.865498049546
distances from one another, like sentinels. After walking for about ten	249.15763165983944
minutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his	172.27507782868148
guide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds;	274.7458148783929
three men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the	281.1898540986401
centre. He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move.	367.8373935523471
“_Avanti!_” said the same sharp and imperative voice.	276.54700418065283
This time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word and	330.20095749643076
gesture had not explained the speaker’s meaning, it was clearly	251.99952423307076
expressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that	266.1867908889446
he struck against the guide. This guide was our friend Peppino, who	297.8379880203394
dashed into the thicket of high weeds, through a path which none but	216.59333208144045
lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road.	313.8636506730945
Peppino stopped before a rock overhung by thick hedges; the rock, half	260.0125077663509
open, afforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the	222.26930967030216
evil spirits in the fairy tales. The voice and gesture of the man who	327.8819234319897
followed Danglars ordered him to do the same. There was no longer any	249.69571190982
doubt, the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditti. Danglars	317.76448813213597
acquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions,	307.1137786229542
and who is rendered brave by fear. Notwithstanding his large stomach,	261.51632228968185
certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna, he	278.0833686688713
slid down like Peppino, and closing his eyes fell upon his feet. As he	202.37685364826663
touched the ground, he opened his eyes.	203.43266406509701
50245m	351.8367505380434
The path was wide, but dark. Peppino, who cared little for being	303.8868830632961
recognized now that he was in his own territories, struck a light and	332.5183595024971
lit a torch. Two other men descended after Danglars forming the	347.984863456605
rearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he happened to stop, they came	179.58256818617548
by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors. The walls	333.7888194788594
were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the other, and which seemed	324.3347564010391
in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes, like	185.3154377870818
those which we see on the faces of the dead. A sentinel struck the	247.40153664481844
rings of his carbine against his left hand.	301.8422919660301
“Who comes there?” he cried.	194.39354220998462
“A friend, a friend!” said Peppino; “but where is the captain?”	270.81878457825326
“There,” said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious	212.2846338526665
crypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the	302.06983430327296
passage through the large arched openings.	298.2412612180871
“Fine spoil, captain, fine spoil!” said Peppino in Italian, and taking	173.65724185286925
Danglars by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an opening	243.4459317341925
resembling a door, through which they entered the apartment which the	228.6615992082285
captain appeared to have made his dwelling-place.	346.26817566866714
“Is this the man?” asked the captain, who was attentively reading	173.97341002980855
Plutarch’s _Life of Alexander_.	334.5816056322134
“Himself, captain—himself.”	284.44199565794077
“Very well, show him to me.”	366.9845954117981
At this rather impertinent order, Peppino raised his torch to the face	305.1536289039509
of Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes	196.9021364534606
burnt. His agitated features presented the appearance of pale and	264.83217986021214
hideous terror.	174.93571668018456
“The man is tired,” said the captain, “conduct him to his bed.”	365.07488997646954
“Oh,” murmured Danglars, “that bed is probably one of the coffins	318.4256143084291
hollowed in the wall, and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from	295.21713444300815
one of the poniards I see glistening in the darkness.”	189.6031258185581
From their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the	287.96567654131263
chamber now arose the companions of the man who had been found by	335.8266606364341
Albert de Morcerf reading _Cæsar’s Commentaries_, and by Danglars	278.1279971877133
studying the _Life of Alexander_. The banker uttered a groan and	350.9693900253318
followed his guide; he neither supplicated nor exclaimed. He no longer	231.25755178811778
possessed strength, will, power, or feeling; he followed where they led	254.6668842121967
him. At length he found himself at the foot of a staircase, and he	330.29480994628085
mechanically lifted his foot five or six times. Then a low door was	283.8153810649103
opened before him, and bending his head to avoid striking his forehead	370.9908459660933
he entered a small room cut out of the rock. The cell was clean, though	325.77392750413287
empty, and dry, though situated at an immeasurable distance under the	256.1930500867127
earth. A bed of dried grass covered with goat-skins was placed in one	278.1545331058062
corner. Danglars brightened up on beholding it, fancying that it gave	346.88146936101424
some promise of safety.	275.89276052040674
“Oh, God be praised,” he said; “it is a real bed!”	234.20706296424308
This was the second time within the hour that he had invoked the name	205.7273251806817
of God. He had not done so for ten years before.	185.29315038089376
“_Ecco!_” said the guide, and pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed	238.77253519048486
the door upon him.	266.24973919849634
A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner. If there had been no bolt,	252.3109245347306
it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the	368.00651079008776
garrison who held the catacombs of St. Sebastian, encamped round a	337.07951952206463
master whom our readers must have recognized as the famous Luigi Vampa.	185.00586232546374
Danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose existence he would not	239.54845161189814
believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in Paris; and not only did	359.03906284233324
he recognize him, but the cell in which Albert had been confined, and	266.723720702593
which was probably kept for the accommodation of strangers. These	187.8188683221294
recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by Danglars, and	282.80081822786536
restored him to some degree of tranquillity. Since the bandits had not	213.18100342647307
despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill him at all.	205.56211434435068
They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he had only a	260.86497120435126
few louis about him, he doubted not he would be ransomed.	222.48167907198766
He remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he	291.51121657039783
considered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed his	341.233267323811
own price at 8,000 crowns. Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000	363.65619973729264
livres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left. With this sum	252.15421197645531
he could manage to keep out of difficulties. Therefore, tolerably	235.7751257279636
secure in being able to extricate himself from his position, provided	363.4901933542976
he were not rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he	260.52357196319474
stretched himself on his bed, and after turning over two or three	215.72936230251545
times, fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi	284.75166308388486
Vampa was studying.	193.40821382674875
 Chapter 115. Luigi Vampa’s Bill of Fare	234.4826981051229
We awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He awoke.	242.71471986534334
To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet	366.2845585241866
drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which	244.02561826016995
diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of	285.20360513924027
the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like	277.5372843472835
the continuation of some disagreeable dream. But in such a situation a	342.7436853169853
single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty.	266.92974429753104
“Yes, yes,” he murmured, “I am in the hands of the brigands of whom	307.1586988580867
Albert de Morcerf spoke.” His first idea was to breathe, that he might	335.3699810903364
know whether he was wounded. He borrowed this from _Don Quixote_, the	309.7466728110211
only book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.	192.06183912914062
“No,” he cried, “they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed	190.86705700700375
me!” and he thrust his hands into his pockets. They were untouched; the	214.87907749890667
hundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were	226.34217916274062
in his trousers pocket, and in that of his greatcoat he found the	204.938140849133
little note-case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs.	254.61340163319102
“Singular bandits!” he exclaimed; “they have left me my purse and	181.76197399565214
pocket-book. As I was saying last night, they intend me to be ransomed.	321.7217259614191
Hello, here is my watch! Let me see what time it is.”	334.0878662435657
Danglars’ watch, one of Breguet’s repeaters, which he had carefully	307.8749360488207
wound up on the previous night, struck half past five. Without this,	176.39324891261643
Danglars would have been quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did	221.0610383477751
not reach his cell. Should he demand an explanation from the bandits,	219.3266702588146
or should he wait patiently for them to propose it? The last	335.07606622301495
alternative seemed the most prudent, so he waited until twelve o’clock.	286.71077660126963
During all this time a sentinel, who had been relieved at eight	176.32516653807988
o’clock, had been watching his door.	237.5060699352334
50249m	266.406290476109
Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who kept	309.017299688384
watch over him. He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight, but	228.92257546920632
from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door; he	272.0849621103281
approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful	255.14284664613928
of brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent	255.39536858987833
forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars. “Faugh!” he	219.37713159280946
exclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.	265.8435963806431
At twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars,	185.95623567429382
wishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.	301.0850178851686
He was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and a	284.5422530287285
flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around	361.0586820078664
his shoulders.	333.5171295099342
“Ah, ha,” cried Danglars, “this fellow is more like an ogre than	349.5318175035766
anything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be very good	351.4437563595572
eating!”	214.25430046597052
We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at the same time, as	355.8167265568636
though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black	245.07438329399278
bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring	368.0665009453737
voraciously.	275.84417835436375
“May I be hanged,” said Danglars, glancing at the bandit’s dinner	314.3236212552485
through the crevices of the door,—“may I be hanged if I can understand	332.3882727680303
how people can eat such filth!” and he withdrew to seat himself upon	305.6827875719655
his goat-skin, which reminded him of the smell of the brandy.	292.2387193385315
But the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain	324.55910499933225
invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very	368.96243198927243
irresistibly to a fasting stomach. Danglars felt his own not to be very	333.2154160797479
well supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the	333.84927796719967
bread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful	357.6558689334358
vulgar onions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes,	219.70765159508795
which his cook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said,	187.91308725756443
“Monsieur Deniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee today.” He got	242.35684428933547
up and knocked on the door; the bandit raised his head. Danglars knew	188.34962871123497
that he was heard, so he redoubled his blows.	235.54220114535522
“_Che cosa?_” asked the bandit.	186.02229766261746
“Come, come,” said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, “I	310.64161384177737
think it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!”	319.76573001183823
But whether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no	321.7029870053601
orders respecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without	305.100487290533
answering, went on with his dinner. Danglars’ feelings were hurt, and	196.05898742843993
not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker	351.9681697835754
threw himself down again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another	333.49117567313715
word.	202.1064065947787
Four hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.	334.3529447314284
Danglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the	274.72782495148283
stomach, arose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of the door,	325.125756890079
and recognized the intelligent countenance of his guide. It was,	352.6387373398136
indeed, Peppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as	297.73087407624575
possible by seating himself opposite to the door, and placing between	347.1478285202847
his legs an earthen pan, containing chick-peas stewed with bacon. Near	226.2649362473128
the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a	286.40592491366067
flask of Orvieto. Peppino was decidedly an epicure. Danglars watched	316.103324319277
these preparations and his mouth watered.	333.8479541269071
“Come,” he said to himself, “let me try if he will be more tractable	262.08412844497
than the other;” and he tapped gently at the door.	341.181218626596
“_On y va_,” (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting the house	171.76068873136873
of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its idioms.	181.41739576103038
Danglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in	229.51857123890028
such a furious manner, “Put in your head!” But this was not the time	277.18108273354926
for recrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said	317.0881797632948
with a gracious smile:	200.41316157180148
“Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any dinner?”	172.84748326429798
“Does your excellency happen to be hungry?”	310.2884796890263
“Happen to be hungry,—that’s pretty good, when I haven’t eaten for	296.652491035185
twenty-four hours!” muttered Danglars. Then he added aloud, “Yes, sir,	195.5503544306862
I am hungry—very hungry.”	350.5963978111844
“And your excellency wants something to eat?”	190.3720865635128
“At once, if possible”	301.1987885080363
“Nothing easier,” said Peppino. “Here you can get anything you want; by	218.58946794866023
paying for it, of course, as among honest folk.”	366.6228190125266
“Of course!” cried Danglars. “Although, in justice, the people who	193.64600276285415
arrest and imprison you, ought, at least, to feed you.”	359.7393672118293
“That is not the custom, excellency,” said Peppino.	250.51465226268328
“A bad reason,” replied Danglars, who reckoned on conciliating his	235.21762045450663
keeper; “but I am content. Let me have some dinner!”	268.39910355669906
“At once! What would your excellency like?”	282.22364408269243
And Peppino placed his pan on the ground, so that the steam rose	364.75989756942306
directly under the nostrils of Danglars. “Give your orders.”	330.01534817897925
“Have you kitchens here?”	234.7856616855874
“Kitchens?—of course—complete ones.”	269.7667990960574
“And cooks?”	190.70095548853283
“Excellent!”	364.6570757715777
“Well, a fowl, fish, game,—it signifies little, so that I eat.”	287.60864722330143
“As your excellency pleases. You mentioned a fowl, I think?”	295.1158862191915
“Yes, a fowl.”	215.3122981977288
Peppino, turning around, shouted, “A fowl for his excellency!” His	251.6654371628278
voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome, graceful, and	189.3141904656013
half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his	293.32214290134874
head, without the assistance of his hands.	344.06380056625915
“I could almost believe myself at the Café de Paris,” murmured	347.05128431231685
Danglars.	186.92417509912406
“Here, your excellency,” said Peppino, taking the fowl from the young	201.85891675308034
bandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool and	272.8492245304161
the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell. Danglars	220.9349297237939
asked for a knife and fork.	212.78929373090722
“Here, excellency,” said Peppino, offering him a little blunt knife and	338.1958162451266
a boxwood fork. Danglars took the knife in one hand and the fork in the	183.6772364725917
other, and was about to cut up the fowl.	326.9099577612101
“Pardon me, excellency,” said Peppino, placing his hand on the banker’s	303.43018197360425
shoulder; “people pay here before they eat. They might not be	211.53617182131163
satisfied, and——”	311.7448744735807
“Ah, ha,” thought Danglars, “this is not so much like Paris, except	361.8836115123663
that I shall probably be skinned! Never mind, I’ll fix that all right.	308.88838614419615
I have always heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I should think a	347.58162790431703
fowl is worth about twelve sous at Rome.—There,” he said, throwing a	272.8320436283073
louis down.	224.85053549457297
Peppino picked up the louis, and Danglars again prepared to carve the	281.88150434225685
fowl.	312.74399248435543
“Stay a moment, your excellency,” said Peppino, rising; “you still owe	236.16499595927985
me something.”	237.9824826064974
“I said they would skin me,” thought Danglars; but resolving to resist	268.6340967550103
the extortion, he said, “Come, how much do I owe you for this fowl?”	172.5113634652287
“Your excellency has given me a louis on account.”	356.41323305409
“A louis on account for a fowl?”	215.40497736969778
“Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.”	185.99920637344565
Danglars opened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke.	231.97390280289164
“Very droll,” he muttered, “very droll indeed,” and he again began to	190.97921173099184
carve the fowl, when Peppino stopped the baron’s right hand with his	356.68071510027505
left, and held out his other hand.	231.6626542603089
“Come, now,” he said.	321.27907272852485
“Is it not a joke?” said Danglars.	197.66955978738656
“We never joke,” replied Peppino, solemn as a Quaker.	248.42403048747116
“What! A hundred thousand francs for a fowl!”	215.75303382192783
“Ah, excellency, you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in	359.13001026747304
these horrible caves!”	254.6609562211475
“Come, come, this is very droll—very amusing—I allow; but, as I am very	252.36672406394075
hungry, pray allow me to eat. Stay, here is another louis for you.”	266.0954613425196
“Then that will make only 4,998 louis more,” said Peppino with the same	225.33625808504382
indifference. “I shall get them all in time.”	222.73925009868483
“Oh, as for that,” said Danglars, angry at this prolongation of the	313.40994434741356
jest,—“as for that you won’t get them at all. Go to the devil! You do	366.17434458250193
not know with whom you have to deal!”	251.96064813565619
50253m	342.6214429332232
Peppino made a sign, and the youth hastily removed the fowl. Danglars	234.9617012410163
threw himself upon his goat-skin, and Peppino, reclosing the door,	264.8988255315603
again began eating his peas and bacon. Though Danglars could not see	269.4382922979761
Peppino, the noise of his teeth allowed no doubt as to his occupation.	224.24583271375295
He was certainly eating, and noisily too, like an ill-bred man.	207.82626440591469
“Brute!” said Danglars. Peppino pretended not to hear him, and without	296.4435563636438
even turning his head continued to eat slowly. Danglars’ stomach felt	248.12032757228224
so empty, that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it	227.73019911962638
again; still he had patience for another half-hour, which appeared to	344.19109836999814
him like a century. He again arose and went to the door.	217.60858704087045
“Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any longer, but tell me what	189.4525264333697
they want.”	210.2059431383799
“Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you want. Give	362.33207828734794
your orders, and we will execute them.”	181.3046342970463
“Then open the door directly.” Peppino obeyed. “Now look here, I want	249.63066949670463
something to eat! To eat—do you hear?”	283.55792458372264
“Are you hungry?”	343.59650557453404
“Come, you understand me.”	296.1737248935061
“What would your excellency like to eat?”	224.07363240695082
“A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in this	221.71873919361963
accursed place.”	289.27850944793283
“Bread? Very well. Holloa, there, some bread!” he called. The youth	184.93033179969362
brought a small loaf. “How much?” asked Danglars.	205.48947130072779
“Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,” said Peppino; “You	195.22906810457533
have paid two louis in advance.”	301.2590370543158
50255m	328.9523755452957
“What? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?”	331.7497655194213
“One hundred thousand francs,” repeated Peppino.	325.6470210866895
“But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!”	369.214139605538
“We have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing	350.45955000851177
whether you eat much or little—whether you have ten dishes or one—it is	322.3418193947994
always the same price.”	368.79865500915486
“What, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is	240.72985165996351
perfectly ridiculous—stupid! You had better tell me at once that you	298.6663816862278
intend starving me to death.”	337.2976126372622
“Oh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide.	365.7889032188185
Pay and eat.”	305.7623011920749
“And what am I to pay with, brute?” said Danglars, enraged. “Do you	333.8395266537972
suppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?”	272.3761665476851
“Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be	207.0581441158044
fifty fowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.”	285.1832694604602
Danglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood	185.7378090121375
the joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just	325.9890821861402
before.	281.76896125383695
“Come,” he said, “if I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be	206.12600672740996
satisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?”	181.06219655575117
“Certainly,” said Peppino.	319.0875260462899
“But how can I pay them?”	185.8657707888028
“Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson &	234.45538018523538
French, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these	342.28174847624325
gentlemen, and our banker shall take it.”	264.7289509346443
Danglars thought it as well to comply with a good grace, so he took the	253.76134023002902
pen, ink, and paper Peppino offered him, wrote the draft, and signed	189.76976130084165
it.	315.65643798039173
“Here,” he said, “here is a draft at sight.”	204.6865870656536
“And here is your fowl.”	326.03543390456394
Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl; it appeared very thin for the	295.24970423259396
price it had cost. As for Peppino, he examined the paper attentively,	185.31709066163157
put it into his pocket, and continued eating his peas.	252.97600681170866
 Chapter 116. The Pardon	341.0189696686342
The next day Danglars was again hungry; certainly the air of that	276.40007772207986
dungeon was very provocative of appetite. The prisoner expected that he	183.93299271117573
would be at no expense that day, for like an economical man he had	333.09783863691496
concealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of	345.8693882775133
his cell. But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had	200.46351131272166
forgotten that. He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave	306.9383180803252
to the roof of his mouth; then, no longer able to resist, he called	220.55649425616764
out. The sentinel opened the door; it was a new face. He thought it	197.26962429979676
would be better to transact business with his old acquaintance, so he	352.1797682307133
sent for Peppino.	240.01529306650707
“Here I am, your excellency,” said Peppino, with an eagerness which	357.73879077691754
Danglars thought favorable to him. “What do you want?”	195.23983757463543
“Something to drink.”	256.50228713452736
“Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near Rome.”	281.2282040226113
“Then give me water,” cried Danglars, endeavoring to parry the blow.	327.4765612940657
“Oh, water is even more scarce than wine, your excellency,—there has	175.13466342943417
been such a drought.”	229.07372864695378
“Come,” thought Danglars, “it is the same old story.” And while he	233.31582027066054
smiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke, he felt his	252.33859414735423
temples get moist with perspiration.	329.1101808640732
“Come, my friend,” said Danglars, seeing that he made no impression on	349.67002384019503
Peppino, “you will not refuse me a glass of wine?”	247.23244985328353
“I have already told you that we do not sell at retail.”	349.84937570369686
“Well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.”	368.66986297431845
“They are all the same price.”	255.56366484357972
“And what is that?”	368.4082614080679
“Twenty-five thousand francs a bottle.”	227.9711934690478
“Tell me,” cried Danglars, in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon30 alone	311.33537232360084
has been capable of revealing—“tell me that you wish to despoil me of	258.6649798283876
all; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal.”	345.23067360717533
“It is possible such may be the master’s intention.”	246.71896762484744
“The master?—who is he?”	204.4992016405501
“The person to whom you were conducted yesterday.”	314.8319137758053
“Where is he?”	354.1011506525309
“Here.”	259.53517304148266
“Let me see him.”	235.52970393797838
“Certainly.”	248.56917333170782
And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars.	239.83546556729613
“You sent for me?” he said to the prisoner.	222.465710638165
“Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?”	244.33846550491694
“Yes, your excellency. What then?”	226.98307582621388
“How much do you require for my ransom?”	271.72164696483605
“Merely the 5,000,000 you have about you.” Danglars felt a dreadful	363.7196326538391
spasm dart through his heart.	334.16306092784794
“But this is all I have left in the world,” he said, “out of an immense	368.49342145568403
fortune. If you deprive me of that, take away my life also.”	368.5899385012855
“We are forbidden to shed your blood.”	244.1304646148604
“And by whom are you forbidden?”	347.44158177717895
“By him we obey.”	231.55226923037722
“You do, then, obey someone?”	265.0654199461058
“Yes, a chief.”	294.8106198991819
“I thought you said you were the chief?”	335.99657483676856
“So I am of these men; but there is another over me.”	302.0151392411763
“And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?”	357.5118044951083
“Yes.”	222.89684062373226
“But my purse will be exhausted.”	262.7738579295973
“Probably.”	189.73129737915664
“Come,” said Danglars, “will you take a million?”	300.3174678144984
“No.”	340.2170811532916
“Two millions?—three?—four? Come, four? I will give them to you on	296.7033906285246
condition that you let me go.”	349.096387588617
“Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000? This is a	231.09292372190737
kind of usury, banker, that I do not understand.”	186.3398832584033
“Take all, then—take all, I tell you, and kill me!”	316.04665315459545
“Come, come, calm yourself. You will excite your blood, and that would	222.17570938643837
produce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy. Be	213.7143735053224
more economical.”	325.6728634408613
“But when I have no more money left to pay you?” asked the infuriated	211.4628137412524
Danglars.	197.656274167151
“Then you must suffer hunger.”	246.33997670058974
“Suffer hunger?” said Danglars, becoming pale.	368.4867862208523
“Most likely,” replied Vampa coolly.	193.91392559287618
“But you say you do not wish to kill me?”	316.5830373040392
“No.”	242.698326240887
“And yet you will let me perish with hunger?”	250.45177463540045
“Ah, that is a different thing.”	359.03573779433736
“Well, then, wretches,” cried Danglars, “I will defy your infamous	173.48463853100546
calculations—I would rather die at once! You may torture, torment, kill	354.02262360183715
me, but you shall not have my signature again!”	182.92456936640488
“As your excellency pleases,” said Vampa, as he left the cell.	276.49642956058653
Danglars, raving, threw himself on the goat-skin. Who could these men	369.60634500404154
be? Who was the invisible chief? What could be his intentions towards	326.02475416012
him? And why, when everyone else was allowed to be ransomed, might he	228.5456070779509
not also be? Oh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine	285.39585714088776
means of deceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue	208.2409716642744
him with such incomprehensible vengeance. But to die? For the first	174.56593128902955
time in his life, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread	234.1488527693437
and desire; the time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists	194.15825846578667
in the mind of every human creature, arrested his attention and called	309.30369204706943
out with every pulsation of his heart, “Thou shalt die!”	255.68151401667188
Danglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies,	215.5649207508197
then despairs, and at last, by the very force of desperation, sometimes	274.029949337057
succeeds in eluding its pursuers. Danglars meditated an escape; but the	212.88228015978336
walls were solid rock, a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to	210.3517008310383
the cell, and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually	183.38797544104574
passed. His resolution not to sign lasted two days, after which he	289.68813852555803
offered a million for some food. They sent him a magnificent supper,	322.30853864305914
and took his million.	241.65485530849912
From this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer, but to have	276.0931172810775
everything he wanted. At the end of twelve days, after having made a	228.45661575907573
splendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only	227.92196120356544
50,000 francs left. Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just	191.33041082791704
abandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left,	197.27547045796808
and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of	235.95981252443335
privation—he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of	293.20306714337005
madness.	193.4632760836238
He, who for so long a time had forgotten God, began to think that	236.207334220936
miracles were possible—that the accursed cavern might be discovered by	321.1057918358922
the officers of the Papal States, who would release him; that then he	215.62106226999813
would have 50,000 remaining, which would be sufficient to save him from	266.8138352550318
starvation; and finally he prayed that this sum might be preserved to	338.8450007402716
him, and as he prayed he wept. Three days passed thus, during which his	182.39829373489314
prayers were frequent, if not heartfelt. Sometimes he was delirious,	339.9598135103752
and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he, also, was	299.78933965901433
dying of hunger.	252.15570471536742
On the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse. He had	181.60077552174738
picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was	285.9254706321804
beginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell. Then	261.5188689236875
he entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food;	186.61684720014355
he offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread. But Peppino did	270.90472282376004
not answer. On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the	270.81259730237366
cell.	326.9768008719076
“Are you not a Christian?” he said, falling on his knees. “Do you wish	369.7528362977963
to assassinate a man who, in the eyes of Heaven, is a brother? Oh, my	260.70408269259406
former friends, my former friends!” he murmured, and fell with his face	335.8104272279876
to the ground. Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, “The chief, the	189.3253263176268
chief!”	263.2210243190749
“Here I am,” said Vampa, instantly appearing; “what do you want?”	348.03333353953576
“Take my last gold,” muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book,	181.9695959324826
“and let me live here; I ask no more for liberty—I only ask to live!”	270.96147463368237
“Then you suffer a great deal?”	210.23326326370713
“Oh, yes, yes, cruelly!”	198.79859503225723
“Still, there have been men who suffered more than you.”	369.45843974395456
“I do not think so.”	176.92845664037375
“Yes; those who have died of hunger.”	286.57291132967254
Danglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he had	346.9776490344599
seen groaning on his bed. He struck his forehead on the ground and	245.01462151150162
groaned. “Yes,” he said, “there have been some who have suffered more	357.7767797453678
than I have, but then they must have been martyrs at least.”	189.22002225012764
“Do you repent?” asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars’	355.15737328051637
hair to stand on end. His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish	176.77816131232035
objects, and behind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak, half	367.1407188821379
lost in the shadow of a stone column.	352.6993850726228
“Of what must I repent?” stammered Danglars.	198.03162438995162
“Of the evil you have done,” said the voice.	264.3052280927935
“Oh, yes; oh, yes, I do indeed repent.” And he struck his breast with	187.99457189403614
his emaciated fist.	171.90714814060019
“Then I forgive you,” said the man, dropping his cloak, and advancing	227.06646953282737
to the light.	356.09711830354956
“The Count of Monte Cristo!” said Danglars, more pale from terror than	246.07372469839265
he had been just before from hunger and misery.	204.94645175510155
“You are mistaken—I am not the Count of Monte Cristo.”	260.26214643012906
“Then who are you?”	352.3845165258575
50261m	277.3656484554234
“I am he whom you sold and dishonored—I am he whose betrothed you	257.87554830343225
prostituted—I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise	350.87345684910946
yourself to fortune—I am he whose father you condemned to die of	235.27055685142756
hunger—I am he whom you also condemned to starvation, and who yet	182.5393787785912
forgives you, because he hopes to be forgiven—I am Edmond Dantès!”	226.23186958675575
Danglars uttered a cry, and fell prostrate.	276.846369818847
“Rise,” said the count, “your life is safe; the same good fortune has	338.499392354707
not happened to your accomplices—one is mad, the other dead. Keep the	359.49724121991323
50,000 francs you have left—I give them to you. The 5,000,000 you stole	241.9191101357909
from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand. And	286.91773385017564
now eat and drink; I will entertain you tonight. Vampa, when this man	343.7047165257282
is satisfied, let him be free.”	215.1070424308771
Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he raised	316.5104036779619
his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but a shadow,	358.80971321092073
before which the bandits bowed.	221.76506989936078
According to the count’s directions, Danglars was waited on by Vampa,	206.60967972236688
who brought him the best wine and fruits of Italy; then, having	330.852677968223
conducted him to the road, and pointed to the post-chaise, left him	222.75283092900605
leaning against a tree. He remained there all night, not knowing where	339.6482657776788
he was. When daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream; he was	301.46361843333784
thirsty, and dragged himself towards it. As he stooped down to drink,	239.55259872066912
he saw that his hair had become entirely white.	205.2137607443084
 Chapter 117. The Fifth of October	317.3894186208356
It was about six o’clock in the evening; an opal-colored light, through	231.46687542640333
which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue	300.1168073720928
ocean. The heat of the day had gradually decreased, and a light breeze	239.05328485905733
arose, seeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the	242.42365007439176
burning siesta of the south. A delicious zephyr played along the coasts	260.63726067876394
of the Mediterranean, and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume	343.4315555241309
of plants, mingled with the fresh smell of the sea.	172.6800194240557
A light yacht, chaste and elegant in its form, was gliding amidst the	194.7680727690601
first dews of night over the immense lake, extending from Gibraltar to	327.8952723329736
the Dardanelles, and from Tunis to Venice. The vessel resembled a swan	272.27642048342193
with its wings opened towards the wind, gliding on the water. It	203.927657747487
advanced swiftly and gracefully, leaving behind it a glittering stretch	368.53135824534445
of foam. By degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but	357.77000186874693
as though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen	295.34917654404416
mythology, its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave,	199.11807532869364
as if the god of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of Amphitrite, who	210.45642665129122
in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle.	184.35994235547412
The yacht moved rapidly on, though there did not appear to be	194.0430659438046
sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the head of a young girl.	217.63359643316804
Standing on the prow was a tall man, of a dark complexion, who saw with	268.56421555935196
dilating eyes that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the	347.2447329088203
shape of a cone, which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of	202.8382270216207
a Catalan.	215.0265118020529
“Is that Monte Cristo?” asked the traveller, to whose orders the yacht	296.52830952924904
was for the time submitted, in a melancholy voice.	212.6656362217119
“Yes, your excellency,” said the captain, “we have reached it.”	299.84312647867455
“We have reached it!” repeated the traveller in an accent of	204.1557927120463
indescribable sadness.	281.6104878796615
Then he added, in a low tone, “Yes; that is the haven.”	228.8114182322988
And then he again plunged into a train of thought, the character of	359.16438619713244
which was better revealed by a sad smile, than it would have been by	330.42358033761246
tears. A few minutes afterwards a flash of light, which was	196.58949814961136
extinguished instantly, was seen on the land, and the sound of firearms	235.42218667057136
reached the yacht.	277.26232653648935
“Your excellency,” said the captain, “that was the land signal, will	262.25047355951995
you answer yourself?”	172.85976910476845
“What signal?”	202.19425495493263
The captain pointed towards the island, up the side of which ascended a	349.0732175389975
volume of smoke, increasing as it rose.	177.62459556118756
“Ah, yes,” he said, as if awaking from a dream. “Give it to me.”	260.8578229339513
The captain gave him a loaded carbine; the traveller slowly raised it,	314.45970264771677
and fired in the air. Ten minutes afterwards, the sails were furled,	185.71158529887933
and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor.	282.49901243485635
The gig was already lowered, and in it were four oarsmen and a	330.4082216267677
coxswain. The traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the	303.95831893973605
stern of the boat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his	333.72706426401146
accommodation, stood up with his arms crossed. The rowers waited, their	343.7822393328052
oars half lifted out of the water, like birds drying their wings.	323.8154650845046
50265m	289.79813705819254
“Give way,” said the traveller. The eight oars fell into the sea	302.93373223482035
simultaneously without splashing a drop of water, and the boat,	291.5404438976815
yielding to the impulsion, glided forward. In an instant they found	264.23477667607574
themselves in a little harbor, formed in a natural creek; the boat	218.3561997927772
grounded on the fine sand.	260.30268834637866
“Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of	280.092299696331
our men, they will carry you ashore?” The young man answered this	222.15069203917216
invitation with a gesture of indifference, and stepped out of the boat;	239.6355061750576
the sea immediately rose to his waist.	341.87186289797285
“Ah, your excellency,” murmured the pilot, “you should not have done	291.6942356060715
so; our master will scold us for it.”	304.28211395262974
The young man continued to advance, following the sailors, who chose a	357.3768059910929
firm footing. Thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man	216.865578508476
stamped on the ground to shake off the wet, and looked around for	284.5727591883525
someone to show him his road, for it was quite dark. Just as he turned,	212.93245770079307
a hand rested on his shoulder, and a voice which made him shudder	201.3032303895679
exclaimed:	192.57757262113574
“Good-evening, Maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!”	358.19312289209233
“Ah, is it you, count?” said the young man, in an almost joyful accent,	300.64211165895034
pressing Monte Cristo’s hand with both his own.	217.7298389925544
“Yes; you see I am as exact as you are. But you are dripping, my dear	196.72838320002748
fellow; you must change your clothes, as Calypso said to Telemachus.	306.4305256447707
Come, I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon	335.8410947131215
forget fatigue and cold.”	240.97990338153602
Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned around; indeed,	313.58928367227116
Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought him had left	217.2481728816607
without being paid, or uttering a word. Already the sound of their oars	243.33381896533348
might be heard as they returned to the yacht.	361.709565444672
“Oh, yes,” said the count, “you are looking for the sailors.”	333.3784937204876
“Yes, I paid them nothing, and yet they are gone.”	201.507259178823
“Never mind that, Maximilian,” said Monte Cristo, smiling. “I have made	233.14054796307167
an agreement with the navy, that the access to my island shall be free	220.31155967093912
of all charge. I have made a bargain.”	332.51627840753446
Morrel looked at the count with surprise. “Count,” he said, “you are	273.5037912036971
not the same here as in Paris.”	184.19955293836466
“How so?”	189.46951789997075
“Here you laugh.” The count’s brow became clouded.	232.81723108237202
“You are right to recall me to myself, Maximilian,” he said; “I was	269.78831706239356
delighted to see you again, and forgot for the moment that all	174.8423430647942
happiness is fleeting.”	312.56571045558405
“Oh, no, no, count,” cried Maximilian, seizing the count’s hands, “pray	305.94036538179864
laugh; be happy, and prove to me, by your indifference, that life is	181.4763007508851
endurable to sufferers. Oh, how charitable, kind, and good you are; you	333.0338387589551
affect this gayety to inspire me with courage.”	266.21341496287425
“You are wrong, Morrel; I was really happy.”	307.02387425369363
“Then you forget me, so much the better.”	321.5951065627005
“How so?”	215.75321357611165
“Yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor, when he entered the	346.3768862159934
arena, ‘He who is about to die salutes you.’”	352.77218762064797
“Then you are not consoled?” asked the count, surprised.	181.21870881320882
“Oh,” exclaimed Morrel, with a glance full of bitter reproach, “do you	354.9510369172448
think it possible that I could be?”	307.2797377506269
“Listen,” said the count. “Do you understand the meaning of my words?	174.7674656671676
You cannot take me for a commonplace man, a mere rattle, emitting a	331.90176353828303
vague and senseless noise. When I ask you if you are consoled, I speak	302.703282089068
to you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets. Well, Morrel,	232.83664226696123
let us both examine the depths of your heart. Do you still feel the	253.67691510588833
same feverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded	305.1310891819977
lion? Have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased	206.2956521286924
in the grave? Are you still actuated by the regret which drags the	335.7197652568866
living to the pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the	339.52279772540834
prostration of fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred? Has the loss	291.073640328582
of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep? Oh, my dear friend,	270.57637940438065
if this be the case,—if you can no longer weep, if your frozen heart be	201.2140126857476
dead, if you put all your trust in God, then, Maximilian, you are	269.7180250055252
consoled—do not complain.”	280.5046696323338
“Count,” said Morrel, in a firm and at the same time soft voice,	317.36292431124616
“listen to me, as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven, though	289.12500567320893
he remains on earth; I come to die in the arms of a friend. Certainly,	220.02647386962173
there are people whom I love. I love my sister Julie,—I love her	237.58109553989888
husband Emmanuel; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last	332.4725590034059
moments. My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; I could not	242.31177046202038
bear to see her suffer. Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand,	344.6216659947032
and alarm the house with his cries. You, count, who are more than	212.26545672560053
mortal, will, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you	231.78048851144038
not?”	220.39978550303294
50267m	362.6840519681863
“My friend,” said the count, “I have still one doubt,—are you weak	293.8543437815197
enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings?”	174.10306502980308
“No, indeed,—I am calm,” said Morrel, giving his hand to the count; “my	336.81788150131877
pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual. No, I feel that I have	341.05959859515036
reached the goal, and I will go no farther. You told me to wait and	256.07397658676314
hope; do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser? I waited a month,	252.89020567107502
or rather I suffered for a month! I did hope (man is a poor wretched	198.21499357300266
creature), I did hope. What I cannot tell,—something wonderful, an	331.140621633101
absurdity, a miracle,—of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled	200.72941034844715
with our reason that folly we call hope. Yes, I did wait—yes, I did	179.3359235368959
hope, count, and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking	175.7817626674859
together, you have unconsciously wounded, tortured my heart, for every	183.18892358621488
word you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me. Oh, count,	306.0743635506602
I shall sleep calmly, deliciously in the arms of death.”	270.4040142494206
Morrel uttered these words with an energy which made the count shudder.	363.8815829741967
“My friend,” continued Morrel, “you named the fifth of October as the	200.0805046785458
end of the period of waiting,—today is the fifth of October,” he took	300.3410410625816
out his watch, “it is now nine o’clock,—I have yet three hours to	207.44160018219512
live.”	240.71386668800517
“Be it so,” said the count, “come.” Morrel mechanically followed the	222.17057732463434
count, and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it. He felt	361.7780582829819
a carpet under his feet, a door opened, perfumes surrounded him, and a	187.8619544551072
brilliant light dazzled his eyes. Morrel hesitated to advance; he	250.8790438466756
dreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw. Monte Cristo drew him	185.43079018416864
in gently.	219.2478833687241
“Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to us of life,	299.1708833332576
like those ancient Romans, who when condemned by Nero, their emperor	244.4810605599763
and heir, sat down at a table covered with flowers, and gently glided	262.49105096347455
into death, amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses?”	244.75257915466915
Morrel smiled. “As you please,” he said; “death is always death,—that	243.81191320397073
is forgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life, and therefore from	272.7565737782522
grief.”	363.3030352685601
He sat down, and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him. They were	272.5684834040527
in the marvellous dining-room before described, where the statues had	282.0368581335203
baskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers. Morrel	240.0095217951615
had looked carelessly around, and had probably noticed nothing.	348.72525383911056
“Let us talk like men,” he said, looking at the count.	185.13987445761498
“Go on!”	193.9390455018851
“Count,” said Morrel, “you are the epitome of all human knowledge, and	295.63420294092305
you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world	302.12835328315134
than ours.”	216.77468015435448
“There is something true in what you say,” said the count, with that	245.24017967952076
smile which made him so handsome; “I have descended from a planet	335.3508460705642
called grief.”	289.8777283989963
50269m	290.4237187023016
“I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for	355.066739826799
instance, you told me to live, and I did live; you told me to hope, and	196.65118547554576
I almost did so. I am almost inclined to ask you, as though you had	367.7229597870203
experienced death, ‘is it painful to die?’”	358.59776581341043
Monte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness. “Yes,”	200.83340797937788
he said, “yes, doubtless it is painful, if you violently break the	365.5547749208794
outer covering which obstinately begs for life. If you plunge a dagger	281.34460211958805
into your flesh, if you insinuate a bullet into your brain, which the	281.6799162456463
least shock disorders,—then certainly, you will suffer pain, and you	332.06892217048147
will repent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a	260.9618640900852
price.”	365.27108068635556
“Yes; I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death, as	269.95651314265757
well as in life; the only thing is to understand it.”	296.0551055935383
“You have spoken truly, Maximilian; according to the care we bestow	233.28486623597223
upon it, death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse, or an	353.102936311332
enemy who violently drags the soul from the body. Some day, when the	200.86092844508678
world is much older, and when mankind will be masters of all the	258.7302811005622
destructive powers in nature, to serve for the general good of	296.1269283559519
humanity; when mankind, as you were just saying, have discovered the	178.0935531648367
secrets of death, then that death will become as sweet and voluptuous	360.0039140807219
as a slumber in the arms of your beloved.”	198.74589293330888
“And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?”	226.4700354258569
“Yes.”	276.5038477905391
Morrel extended his hand. “Now I understand,” he said, “why you had me	252.61788101841975
brought here to this desolate spot, in the midst of the ocean, to this	310.99728060234617
subterranean palace; it was because you loved me, was it not, count? It	294.2398601966362
was because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet	260.17659366921356
means of death of which we were speaking; a death without agony, a	313.4929809266723
death which allows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine’s name	229.52683379165174
and pressing your hand.”	241.86462284503193
“Yes, you have guessed rightly, Morrel,” said the count, “that is what	192.3912484294027
I intended.”	286.3648300748073
“Thanks; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer, is sweet to	292.6726695685144
my heart.”	229.77553282493253
“Do you then regret nothing?”	327.64965101689836
“No,” replied Morrel.	183.72238494113392
“Not even me?” asked the count with deep emotion. Morrel’s clear eye	211.44351232081925
was for the moment clouded, then it shone with unusual lustre, and a	255.8338487724505
large tear rolled down his cheek.	312.85002734992077
“What,” said the count, “do you still regret anything in the world, and	319.6995185486685
yet die?”	261.195576235167
“Oh, I entreat you,” exclaimed Morrel in a low voice, “do not speak	240.39094132534694
another word, count; do not prolong my punishment.”	307.4840185615437
The count fancied that he was yielding, and this belief revived the	216.91496236551427
horrible doubt that had overwhelmed him at the Château d’If.	247.67894005707
“I am endeavoring,” he thought, “to make this man happy; I look upon	296.0818266487543
this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil	319.2438143371392
I have wrought. Now, supposing I am deceived, supposing this man has	224.75070663969316
not been unhappy enough to merit happiness. Alas, what would become of	327.9185500170037
me who can only atone for evil by doing good?”	339.86221226481496
50271m	240.38661127604257
Then he said aloud: “Listen, Morrel, I see your grief is great, but	303.5770209850091
still you do not like to risk your soul.” Morrel smiled sadly.	196.9558103458877
“Count,” he said, “I swear to you my soul is no longer my own.”	303.9125941241338
“Maximilian, you know I have no relation in the world. I have	199.68542313026916
accustomed myself to regard you as my son: well, then, to save my son,	303.8566031206552
I will sacrifice my life, nay, even my fortune.”	193.25493227568722
“What do you mean?”	249.2396384755835
“I mean, that you wish to quit life because you do not understand all	228.0561377019497
the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune. Morrel, I	269.07823368287995
possess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you; with such a	282.36431645298876
fortune you can attain every wish. Are you ambitious? Every career is	311.10564964876073
open to you. Overturn the world, change its character, yield to mad	300.58419568064977
ideas, be even criminal—but live.”	203.8510651381853
“Count, I have your word,” said Morrel coldly; then taking out his	301.6610346720605
watch, he added, “It is half-past eleven.”	209.20672189600214
“Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?”	225.7414858716242
“Then let me go,” said Maximilian, “or I shall think you did not love	331.9522637772595
me for my own sake, but for yours;” and he arose.	264.3933115800265
“It is well,” said Monte Cristo whose countenance brightened at these	216.7951003312486
words; “you wish it—you are inflexible. Yes, as you said, you are	211.66771897988656
indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you. Sit down, Morrel, and	196.5235253491222
wait.”	208.42218361064033
Morrel obeyed; the count arose, and unlocking a closet with a key	326.3203274561213
suspended from his gold chain, took from it a little silver casket,	256.77087828502624
beautifully carved and chased, the corners of which represented four	307.8194354536931
bending figures, similar to the Caryatides, the forms of women, symbols	256.3635506859489
of the angels aspiring to heaven.	361.6540579002974
He placed the casket on the table; then opening it took out a little	296.5110393163667
golden box, the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring.	343.8289635621373
This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid, of which it was	327.7830263824323
impossible to discover the color, owing to the reflection of the	331.4216868677686
polished gold, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, which ornamented the box.	238.46838279889772
It was a mixed mass of blue, red, and gold.	295.33008816732286
The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon, and	262.80297650007617
offered it to Morrel, fixing a long steadfast glance upon him. It was	315.66806776997663
then observable that the substance was greenish.	270.38561271566084
“This is what you asked for,” he said, “and what I promised to give	355.4161369655894
you.”	188.32573772541346
“I thank you from the depths of my heart,” said the young man, taking	297.954764462575
the spoon from the hands of Monte Cristo. The count took another spoon,	212.84505878244724
and again dipped it into the golden box. “What are you going to do, my	294.2874897321258
friend?” asked Morrel, arresting his hand.	287.1465219850294
“Well, the fact is, Morrel, I was thinking that I too am weary of life,	276.7511025644121
and since an opportunity presents itself——”	271.72535990707956
“Stay!” said the young man. “You who love, and are beloved; you, who	355.2109397876377
have faith and hope,—oh, do not follow my example. In your case it	228.36503719099343
would be a crime. Adieu, my noble and generous friend, adieu; I will go	266.87129836783174
and tell Valentine what you have done for me.”	212.97126464035208
And slowly, though without any hesitation, only waiting to press the	311.90899993919055
count’s hand fervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered	260.6606798988229
by Monte Cristo. Then they were both silent. Ali, mute and attentive,	270.86047928207347
brought the pipes and coffee, and disappeared. By degrees, the light of	208.81707777726615
the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held	281.18131006350126
them, and the perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel. Seated	309.8790728115554
opposite to him, Monte Cristo watched him in the shadow, and Morrel saw	369.9385520388709
nothing but the bright eyes of the count. An overpowering sadness took	171.754584299504
possession of the young man, his hands relaxed their hold, the objects	262.05273538555616
in the room gradually lost their form and color, and his disturbed	242.9561742561442
vision seemed to perceive doors and curtains open in the wall.	363.0945105784115
50273m	217.2614119118799
“Friend,” he cried, “I feel that I am dying; thanks!”	209.4984417006013
He made a last effort to extend his hand, but it fell powerless beside	267.48808078829586
him. Then it appeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled, not with the	336.143151307798
strange and fearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the	244.79676447743168
secrets of his heart, but with the benevolent kindness of a father for	244.91742844936294
a child. At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature,	278.03450261097925
his form, nearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against	325.0630853363532
the red tapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the	293.0366864686895
attitude of an avenging angel. Morrel, overpowered, turned around in	336.65337708736695
the armchair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein. A change of	337.59837149577686
ideas presented themselves to his brain, like a new design on the	303.83152820824324
kaleidoscope. Enervated, prostrate, and breathless, he became	287.20212942840516
unconscious of outward objects; he seemed to be entering that vague	313.4778456269996
delirium preceding death. He wished once again to press the count’s	260.6074182010239
hand, but his own was immovable. He wished to articulate a last	360.9522988049591
farewell, but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat, like a	352.0979069262394
stone at the mouth of a sepulchre. Involuntarily his languid eyes	252.75572537758342
closed, and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to	279.7965602537155
move amid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped.	309.5321041359804
The count had just opened a door. Immediately a brilliant light from	197.2246876081462
the next room, or rather from the palace adjoining, shone upon the room	182.8752205785588
in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep. Then he saw a woman	341.2489431704412
of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the	290.7635721721576
two rooms. Pale, and sweetly smiling, she looked like an angel of mercy	358.0024205723562
conjuring the angel of vengeance.	359.57908806111834
“Is it heaven that opens before me?” thought the dying man; “that angel	185.38611306992547
resembles the one I have lost.”	222.39568272275704
Monte Cristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman, who advanced	336.97848868353515
towards him with clasped hands and a smile upon her lips.	280.3630447898742
“Valentine, Valentine!” he mentally ejaculated; but his lips uttered no	271.03418977507465
sound, and as though all his strength were centred in that internal	344.79449745058514
emotion, he sighed and closed his eyes. Valentine rushed towards him;	295.8361685617055
his lips again moved.	191.28692218881594
“He is calling you,” said the count; “he to whom you have confided your	180.33899076965977
destiny—he from whom death would have separated you, calls you to him.	318.89181964393754
Happily, I vanquished death. Henceforth, Valentine, you will never	322.65260824537444
again be separated on earth, since he has rushed into death to find	265.1165067173997
you. Without me, you would both have died. May God accept my atonement	264.6848388614636
in the preservation of these two existences!”	218.07134083539552
Valentine seized the count’s hand, and in her irresistible impulse of	297.14985312253424
joy carried it to her lips.	189.91051589025528
50275m	218.1988972495806
“Oh, thank me again!” said the count; “tell me till you are weary, that	325.03833626954395
I have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much I require	197.62086846234342
this assurance.”	196.68764125829946
“Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my heart,” said Valentine; “and if	289.3252331651556
you doubt the sincerity of my gratitude, oh, then, ask Haydée! ask my	248.81573041990958
beloved sister Haydée, who ever since our departure from France, has	360.80138516867817
caused me to wait patiently for this happy day, while talking to me of	348.35066589770463
you.”	317.2229038071536
“You then love Haydée?” asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain	303.9417792877733
endeavored to dissimulate.	173.84688657822682
“Oh, yes, with all my soul.”	188.9115638567451
“Well, then, listen, Valentine,” said the count; “I have a favor to ask	258.57596828406804
of you.”	323.24022458987315
“Of me? Oh, am I happy enough for that?”	280.5145092022369
“Yes; you have called Haydée your sister,—let her become so indeed,	340.27059937342426
Valentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me;	281.500252545464
protect her, for” (the count’s voice was thick with emotion)	317.74278548819234
“henceforth she will be alone in the world.”	330.47899883066464
“Alone in the world!” repeated a voice behind the count, “and why?”	302.68074090700816
Monte Cristo turned around; Haydée was standing pale, motionless,	365.06174061329193
looking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement.	264.18720628425416
“Because tomorrow, Haydée, you will be free; you will then assume your	190.28294607583248
proper position in society, for I will not allow my destiny to	263.51667273024987
overshadow yours. Daughter of a prince, I restore to you the riches and	318.93673953985785
name of your father.”	300.0372884831279
Haydée became pale, and lifting her transparent hands to heaven,	354.3471197561818
exclaimed in a voice stifled with tears, “Then you leave me, my lord?”	305.5032732450787
“Haydée, Haydée, you are young and beautiful; forget even my name, and	248.71582976184126
be happy.”	230.24720179003145
“It is well,” said Haydée; “your order shall be executed, my lord; I	351.5686369642923
will forget even your name, and be happy.” And she stepped back to	331.6362290265183
retire.	338.68329661218536
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Valentine, who was supporting the head of	271.790999382569
Morrel on her shoulder, “do you not see how pale she is? Do you not see	273.49537379390176
how she suffers?”	344.7918070288017
Haydée answered with a heartrending expression,	262.57632217004345
“Why should he understand this, my sister? He is my master, and I am	283.1135243216187
his slave; he has the right to notice nothing.”	181.61299941321914
The count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost	259.56712658211575
recesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he	199.24808555595794
could not bear their brilliancy.	260.5716919683749
“Oh, heavens,” exclaimed Monte Cristo, “can my suspicions be correct?	264.82942482270425
Haydée, would it please you not to leave me?”	229.62891331880974
“I am young,” gently replied Haydée; “I love the life you have made so	324.1594227247831
sweet to me, and I should be sorry to die.”	251.24348162340797
“You mean, then, that if I leave you, Haydée——”	251.41367857009328
“I should die; yes, my lord.”	312.8019526869708
“Do you then love me?”	366.4845324794748
“Oh, Valentine, he asks if I love him. Valentine, tell him if you love	269.9451250248638
Maximilian.”	322.8871470382873
The count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his arms, and	273.39147518100623
Haydée, uttering a cry, sprang into them.	348.382727524583
“Oh, yes,” she cried, “I do love you! I love you as one loves a father,	300.9088705685115
brother, husband! I love you as my life, for you are the best, the	336.84314844947284
noblest of created beings!”	365.37592102600104
50277m	327.6895615370298
“Let it be, then, as you wish, sweet angel; God has sustained me in my	352.9689089035268
struggle with my enemies, and has given me this reward; he will not let	365.7545378648083
me end my triumph in suffering; I wished to punish myself, but he has	285.820359194504
pardoned me. Love me then, Haydée! Who knows? perhaps your love will	199.71100741596973
make me forget all that I do not wish to remember.”	327.94293617292976
“What do you mean, my lord?”	368.34884055147484
“I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty	179.20848610622716
years of slow experience; I have but you in the world, Haydée; through	182.05390699740346
you I again take hold on life, through you I shall suffer, through you	199.6399544450613
rejoice.”	215.28402127337424
“Do you hear him, Valentine?” exclaimed Haydée; “he says that through	368.27262155354373
me he will suffer—through _me_, who would yield my life for his.”	267.05112574929365
The count withdrew for a moment. “Have I discovered the truth?” he	306.50735354982663
said; “but whether it be for recompense or punishment, I accept my	241.6623165097887
fate. Come, Haydée, come!” and throwing his arm around the young girl’s	231.08640534522644
waist, he pressed the hand of Valentine, and disappeared.	252.40303019017506
50279m	226.54606306647727
An hour had nearly passed, during which Valentine, breathless and	308.967902405395
motionless, watched steadfastly over Morrel. At length she felt his	287.68033196779595
heart beat, a faint breath played upon his lips, a slight shudder,	309.8434862856243
announcing the return of life, passed through the young man’s frame. At	295.6720047060093
length his eyes opened, but they were at first fixed and	256.3502997640163
expressionless; then sight returned, and with it feeling and grief.	243.44421073443286
“Oh,” he cried, in an accent of despair, “the count has deceived me; I	314.37405366874646
am yet living;” and extending his hand towards the table, he seized a	321.104223038448
knife.	287.86976781602937
“Dearest,” exclaimed Valentine, with her adorable smile, “awake, and	369.26956327749053
look at me!” Morrel uttered a loud exclamation, and frantic, doubtful,	183.08204743598026
dazzled, as though by a celestial vision, he fell upon his knees.	269.7103275657764
The next morning at daybreak, Valentine and Morrel were walking	223.81165106115242
arm-in-arm on the seashore, Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had	297.873269705271
appeared in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and,	343.537309263613
finally, how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.	183.0004311363603
They had found the door of the grotto opened, and gone forth; on the	330.4949715433505
azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars.	261.3305664292507
Morrel soon perceived a man standing among the rocks, apparently	195.43434658362284
awaiting a sign from them to advance, and pointed him out to Valentine.	175.70149140393912
“Ah, it is Jacopo,” she said, “the captain of the yacht;” and she	231.29072510799222
beckoned him towards them.	320.19795484178803
“Do you wish to speak to us?” asked Morrel.	200.36509688134896
“I have a letter to give you from the count.”	258.8187270225612
“From the count!” murmured the two young people.	300.5781204814707
“Yes; read it.”	364.9975843568885
50281m	298.5554961784042
Morrel opened the letter, and read:	283.0039243464717
“My Dear Maximilian,	279.34160041346865
“There is a felucca for you at anchor. Jacopo will carry you to	267.0149276268844
Leghorn, where Monsieur Noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he	322.87630150560017
wishes to bless before you lead her to the altar. All that is in this	343.38540049256875
grotto, my friend, my house in the Champs-Élysées, and my château at	207.9666882491091
Tréport, are the marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dantès upon the son	182.1574198146983
of his old master, Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them	195.2111640013401
with you; for I entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune	191.00374283800622
reverting to her from her father, now a madman, and her brother who	260.27800705283505
died last September with his mother. Tell the angel who will watch over	279.18140192772773
your future destiny, Morrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who, like	270.17566724642415
Satan, thought himself for an instant equal to God, but who now	179.08445696971657
acknowledges with Christian humility that God alone possesses supreme	276.85579677260233
power and infinite wisdom. Perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse	313.45512151883827
he feels in his heart. As for you, Morrel, this is the secret of my	179.14362195932483
conduct towards you. There is neither happiness nor misery in the	339.6319382158723
world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing	212.69689279785246
more. He who has felt the deepest grief is best able to experience	355.0456169954166
supreme happiness. We must have felt what it is to die, Morrel, that we	305.0258024555411
may appreciate the enjoyments of living.	235.88977424063506
“Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never	275.983683611516
forget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future to	289.90423757640133
man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,—‘_Wait and	265.5421104447222
hope_.’—Your friend,	198.15921449560145
“Edmond Dantès, _Count of Monte Cristo_.”	206.0309148610714
50282m	192.73237337075992
During the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the	310.01071856855197
first time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother,	254.45827831080686
she became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not	334.7950919067636
the less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her	327.13466611368506
happiness cost her very dear.	364.1064143559334
Morrel looked around uneasily.	183.8344519481428
“But,” he said, “the count’s generosity is too overwhelming; Valentine	250.64377628833518
will be satisfied with my humble fortune. Where is the count, friend?	203.02660311626798
Lead me to him.”	334.3313493489055
Jacopo pointed towards the horizon.	182.55802005888978
“What do you mean?” asked Valentine. “Where is the count?—where is	184.63849366041657
Haydée?”	335.60952454097117
“Look!” said Jacopo.	284.88737278236306
The eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and	325.70533198334226
on the blue line separating the sky from the Mediterranean Sea, they	290.76450557506763
perceived a large white sail.	272.4299777805995
“Gone,” said Morrel; “gone!—adieu, my friend—adieu, my father!”	209.2631505712726
“Gone,” murmured Valentine; “adieu, my sweet Haydée—adieu, my sister!”	329.43980610396375
“Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?” said Morrel with	185.11829848365267
tearful eyes.	238.22856217857745
“Darling,” replied Valentine, “has not the count just told us that all	244.08582057052166
human wisdom is summed up in two words:	348.14413607323365
“‘_Wait and hope_ (Fac et spera)!’”	342.7436785533471

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up	336.77430167730995
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations	269.7390607812241

 EPILOGUE	255.83578967959193
AUTHOR’S PREFACE	245.93835417169015
In which it is proved that, notwithstanding their names’ ending in _os_	228.40007507454027
and _is_, the heroes of the story which we are about to have the honor	214.35242652440928
to relate to our readers have nothing mythological about them.	279.3812810053181
A short time ago, while making researches in the Royal Library for my	364.5260538281151
History of Louis XIV., I stumbled by chance upon the Memoirs of M.	272.2057315077958
d’Artagnan, printed—as were most of the works of that period, in which	236.29494182641224
authors could not tell the truth without the risk of a residence, more	206.84817469847036
or less long, in the Bastille—at Amsterdam, by Pierre Rouge. The title	338.0624151709011
attracted me; I took them home with me, with the permission of the	218.93219864901042
guardian, and devoured them.	265.450967026875
It is not my intention here to enter into an analysis of this curious	239.53053972332714
work; and I shall satisfy myself with referring such of my readers as	237.19685980950607
appreciate the pictures of the period to its pages. They will therein	250.89536577593617
find portraits penciled by the hand of a master; and although these	312.69180880940127
squibs may be, for the most part, traced upon the doors of barracks and	355.8287008913112
the walls of cabarets, they will not find the likenesses of Louis XIII.,	257.0400698979381
Anne of Austria, Richelieu, Mazarin, and the courtiers of the period,	350.31499528692973
less faithful than in the history of M. Anquetil.	342.9906681272833
But, it is well known, what strikes the capricious mind of the poet is	206.82637175190897
not always what affects the mass of readers. Now, while admiring, as	179.07951781579527
others doubtless will admire, the details we have to relate, our main	367.9525603554049
preoccupation concerned a matter to which no one before ourselves had	277.7652341769214
given a thought.	301.34441074386723
D’Artagnan relates that on his first visit to M. de Tréville, captain	224.61471313783838
of the king’s Musketeers, he met in the antechamber three young men,	319.6547516873912
serving in the illustrious corps into which he was soliciting the honor	230.8702070133998
of being received, bearing the names of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.	328.08466343654936
We must confess these three strange names struck us; and it immediately	256.9834109462162
occurred to us that they were but pseudonyms, under which D’Artagnan	176.36406057429053
had disguised names perhaps illustrious, or else that the bearers of	276.64011347900896
these borrowed names had themselves chosen them on the day in which,	243.56734987297386
from caprice, discontent, or want of fortune, they had donned the	187.87043024311208
simple Musketeer’s uniform.	266.03843701900973
From that moment we had no rest till we could find some trace in	261.12159451292064
contemporary works of these extraordinary names which had so strongly	173.23733225201534
awakened our curiosity.	174.50313051859982
The catalogue alone of the books we read with this object would fill a	348.3669653796169
whole chapter, which, although it might be very instructive, would	360.6342823466299
certainly afford our readers but little amusement. It will suffice,	220.40945221714074
then, to tell them that at the moment at which, discouraged by so many	360.02258084822915
fruitless investigations, we were about to abandon our search, we at	276.00791561098595
length found, guided by the counsels of our illustrious friend Paulin	289.5983731750859
Paris, a manuscript in folio, endorsed 4772 or 4773, we do not	193.6169979060675
recollect which, having for title, “Memoirs of the Comte de la Fère,	217.58571561627093
Touching Some Events Which Passed in France Toward the End of the Reign	361.5620659004875
of King Louis XIII. and the Commencement of the Reign of King Louis	307.0368739434017
XIV.”	197.37056946726204
It may be easily imagined how great was our joy when, in turning over	202.12699805839893
this manuscript, our last hope, we found at the twentieth page the name	232.73164058793398
of Athos, at the twenty-seventh the name of Porthos, and at the	178.51597945733496
thirty-first the name of Aramis.	305.0004948027954
The discovery of a completely unknown manuscript at a period in which	222.4019468574296
historical science is carried to such a high degree appeared almost	203.91495334523358
miraculous. We hastened, therefore, to obtain permission to print it,	215.77860147143235
with the view of presenting ourselves someday with the pack of others	219.54535388795668
at the doors of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, if we	190.43673657709311
should not succeed—a very probable thing, by the by—in gaining	213.36314479446958
admission to the Académie Française with our own proper pack. This	283.71492610842085
permission, we feel bound to say, was graciously granted; which compels	279.4444290403327
us here to give a public contradiction to the slanderers who pretend	176.22034889529488
that we live under a government but moderately indulgent to men of	263.55218559149034
letters.	303.3300719901896
Now, this is the first part of this precious manuscript which we offer	317.86090668285055
to our readers, restoring it to the title which belongs to it, and	324.3843912051027
entering into an engagement that if (of which we have no doubt) this	195.54010036370596
first part should obtain the success it merits, we will publish the	217.00586154137642
second immediately.	261.8891881106854
In the meanwhile, as the godfather is a second father, we beg the	369.37234095578236
reader to lay to our account, and not to that of the Comte de la Fère,	194.57262736956602
the pleasure or the _ennui_ he may experience.	354.0134638586398
This being understood, let us proceed with our history.	264.5702685453246
The Three Musketeers	257.6991405729706
Chapter I.	277.0696612440622
THE THREE PRESENTS OF D’ARTAGNAN THE ELDER	186.4647916580203
On the first Monday of the month of April, 1625, the market town of	232.10763955591108
Meung, in which the author of _Romance of the Rose_ was born, appeared	172.3591645039317
to be in as perfect a state of revolution as if the Huguenots had just	277.8571000421986
made a second La Rochelle of it. Many citizens, seeing the women flying	350.6024092367925
toward the High Street, leaving their children crying at the open	350.1734009501513
doors, hastened to don the cuirass, and supporting their somewhat	306.3227922888251
uncertain courage with a musket or a partisan, directed their steps	259.03468123299996
toward the hostelry of the Jolly Miller, before which was gathered,	319.0896664889027
increasing every minute, a compact group, vociferous and full of	255.566817041543
curiosity.	207.50173757625146
In those times panics were common, and few days passed without some	301.02884851352314
city or other registering in its archives an event of this kind. There	370.199287378028
were nobles, who made war against each other; there was the king, who	346.91323501002074
made war against the cardinal; there was Spain, which made war against	362.4224992505563
the king. Then, in addition to these concealed or public, secret or	179.27951947183263
open wars, there were robbers, mendicants, Huguenots, wolves, and	333.8858250850753
scoundrels, who made war upon everybody. The citizens always took up	274.06429168095957
arms readily against thieves, wolves or scoundrels, often against	361.4251479863269
nobles or Huguenots, sometimes against the king, but never against the	319.18072627792867
cardinal or Spain. It resulted, then, from this habit that on the said	193.6026466336888
first Monday of April, 1625, the citizens, on hearing the clamor, and	285.36199352916265
seeing neither the red-and-yellow standard nor the livery of the Duc de	228.05772257033206
Richelieu, rushed toward the hostel of the Jolly Miller. When arrived	296.0201711417483
there, the cause of the hubbub was apparent to all.	258.3678607782324
A young man—we can sketch his portrait at a dash. Imagine to yourself a	215.73214177523477
Don Quixote of eighteen; a Don Quixote without his corselet, without	252.7070570042946
his coat of mail, without his cuisses; a Don Quixote clothed in a	201.8434001038606
woolen doublet, the blue color of which had faded into a nameless shade	331.31778674824204
between lees of wine and a heavenly azure; face long and brown; high	185.00692099360816
cheek bones, a sign of sagacity; the maxillary muscles enormously	249.22560423184507
developed, an infallible sign by which a Gascon may always be detected,	364.04911706411303
even without his cap—and our young man wore a cap set off with a sort	269.5638362594452
of feather; the eye open and intelligent; the nose hooked, but finely	332.49584213590146
chiseled. Too big for a youth, too small for a grown man, an	367.42968739877733
experienced eye might have taken him for a farmer’s son upon a journey	294.6930687639156
had it not been for the long sword which, dangling from a leather	288.29406167311157
baldric, hit against the calves of its owner as he walked, and against	276.48330597369477
the rough side of his steed when he was on horseback.	313.3607322908655
For our young man had a steed which was the observed of all observers.	249.7098354619094
It was a Béarn pony, from twelve to fourteen years old, yellow in his	367.65223424511987
hide, without a hair in his tail, but not without windgalls on his	191.65301639453023
legs, which, though going with his head lower than his knees, rendering	190.1182067653354
a martingale quite unnecessary, contrived nevertheless to perform his	172.3911325439434
eight leagues a day. Unfortunately, the qualities of this horse were so	366.35784953101114
well concealed under his strange-colored hide and his unaccountable	348.01621161212466
gait, that at a time when everybody was a connoisseur in horseflesh,	186.52151016935068
the appearance of the aforesaid pony at Meung—which place he had	352.99683105219856
entered about a quarter of an hour before, by the gate of	353.65665289078305
Beaugency—produced an unfavorable feeling, which extended to his rider.	315.5654821604801
And this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young	241.64205295237923
D’Artagnan—for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante	327.2104752302258
named—from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous	289.1619203593393
appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He had	243.3220515782442
sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from M.	266.0005689293383
d’Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was worth	188.45955152155474
at least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the present	243.83987022957785
were above all price.	364.95590200912324
“My son,” said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure Béarn _patois_ of	299.32770014288946
which Henry IV. could never rid himself, “this horse was born in the	279.16973122698016
house of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it	205.45223216683246
ever since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to	294.95220180485217
die tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign	283.597236353324
with it, take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At	231.75386864416495
court, provided you have ever the honor to go there,” continued M.	292.332097120158
d’Artagnan the elder, “—an honor to which, remember, your ancient	276.4800459727449
nobility gives you the right—sustain worthily your name of gentleman,	219.48692459870387
which has been worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years,	204.1929366614557
both for your own sake and the sake of those who belong to you. By the	231.4444376713132
latter I mean your relatives and friends. Endure nothing from anyone	248.17833987762526
except Monsieur the Cardinal and the king. It is by his courage, please	287.31453196517526
observe, by his courage alone, that a gentleman can make his way	239.6715822432961
nowadays. Whoever hesitates for a second perhaps allows the bait to	319.34382416262724
escape which during that exact second fortune held out to him. You are	310.866647876413
young. You ought to be brave for two reasons: the first is that you are	332.47104445772527
a Gascon, and the second is that you are my son. Never fear quarrels,	277.28390290840224
but seek adventures. I have taught you how to handle a sword; you have	229.0665722058201
thews of iron, a wrist of steel. Fight on all occasions. Fight the more	308.75962036967667
for duels being forbidden, since consequently there is twice as much	203.7444672292845
courage in fighting. I have nothing to give you, my son, but fifteen	305.318472040403
crowns, my horse, and the counsels you have just heard. Your mother	300.9557715245745
will add to them a recipe for a certain balsam, which she had from a	320.298635478595
Bohemian and which has the miraculous virtue of curing all wounds that	319.4368919341468
do not reach the heart. Take advantage of all, and live happily and	335.5267329492575
long. I have but one word to add, and that is to propose an example to	369.0181286771573
you—not mine, for I myself have never appeared at court, and have only	283.03089414372727
taken part in religious wars as a volunteer; I speak of Monsieur de	349.263639103993
Tréville, who was formerly my neighbor, and who had the honor to be, as	205.3668524089889
a child, the play-fellow of our king, Louis XIII., whom God preserve!	230.6705856841899
Sometimes their play degenerated into battles, and in these battles the	212.88149471654665
king was not always the stronger. The blows which he received increased	260.87676654240124
greatly his esteem and friendship for Monsieur de Tréville. Afterward,	334.6358912098557
Monsieur de Tréville fought with others: in his first journey to Paris,	263.9010995596949
five times; from the death of the late king till the young one came of	280.170464469231
age, without reckoning wars and sieges, seven times; and from that date	313.1874967712373
up to the present day, a hundred times, perhaps! So that in spite of	359.1625104952361
edicts, ordinances, and decrees, there he is, captain of the	176.08002178230583
Musketeers; that is to say, chief of a legion of Cæsars, whom the king	227.1670261300073
holds in great esteem and whom the cardinal dreads—he who dreads	261.812451903493
nothing, as it is said. Still further, Monsieur de Tréville gains ten	236.14327364199568
thousand crowns a year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you	228.14427836052673
begin. Go to him with this letter, and make him your model in order	262.945435401826
that you may do as he has done.”	242.58608963198833
Upon which M. d’Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son,	334.6078434427832
kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction.	196.81200989587322
On leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who	317.79408192125624
was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we	180.18400822351305
have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux	263.3539496002266
were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the	343.149735667644
other—not that M. d’Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only	347.00959801177896
offspring, but M. d’Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it	343.05681145880794
unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. D’Artagnan	306.28146133696214
was a woman, and still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and—let us	252.39490567592463
speak it to the praise of M. d’Artagnan the younger—notwithstanding the	301.863854189878
efforts he made to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature	292.4098206197595
prevailed, and he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great	329.29659503096565
difficulty in concealing the half.	284.69037285597483
The same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with	226.21064550789657
the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen	257.03600306838723
crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Tréville—the counsels being	363.3606542715378
thrown into the bargain.	263.9621977567138
With such a _vade mecum_ D’Artagnan was morally and physically an exact	324.74357898720405
copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when	350.7069835118436
our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his	348.34395244933694
portrait. Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies;	355.1920568157582
D’Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a	334.48008009960114
provocation—whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was	285.76112901751264
constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the	354.46764602077303
fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its	238.44505755326264
scabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite	320.8125097475061
numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the	269.4921041158025
side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over	191.37356083493233
this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these	209.9782313640286
passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over	190.63496016428107
prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of	259.8621831446211
the ancients. D’Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his	337.7354703358107
susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung.	306.7919047872559
But there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly	311.8867353511214
Miller, without anyone—host, waiter, or hostler—coming to hold his	325.85286390104704
stirrup or take his horse, D’Artagnan spied, though an open window on	346.46892607927396
the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although	312.71248699647526
of rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to	308.58304855393203
listen to him with respect. D’Artagnan fancied quite naturally,	337.3719484391335
according to his custom, that he must be the object of their	189.3023290012984
conversation, and listened. This time D’Artagnan was only in part	237.42063194007974
mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The	320.63242751144713
gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors;	258.8024869257931
and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for	295.4331149584035
the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter. Now, as a	279.5784813310514
half-smile was sufficient to awaken the irascibility of the young man,	273.457048183953
the effect produced upon him by this vociferous mirth may be easily	261.06071344952363
imagined.	336.5185830295326
Nevertheless, D’Artagnan was desirous of examining the appearance of	367.0030351624178
this impertinent personage who ridiculed him. He fixed his haughty eye	217.36682803505127
upon the stranger, and perceived a man of from forty to forty-five	344.4234951766596
years of age, with black and piercing eyes, pale complexion, a strongly	346.57358613969325
marked nose, and a black and well-shaped mustache. He was dressed in a	189.7314578561116
doublet and hose of a violet color, with aiguillettes of the same	279.32738814062327
color, without any other ornaments than the customary slashes, through	238.0151738895051
which the shirt appeared. This doublet and hose, though new, were	175.93634087003895
creased, like traveling clothes for a long time packed in a	214.86908333206418
portmanteau. D’Artagnan made all these remarks with the rapidity of a	208.753055439658
most minute observer, and doubtless from an instinctive feeling that	175.53527834843712
this stranger was destined to have a great influence over his future	280.13929839924543
life.	330.50373187093555
Now, as at the moment in which D’Artagnan fixed his eyes upon the	357.33718500970883
gentleman in the violet doublet, the gentleman made one of his most	363.15240520750206
knowing and profound remarks respecting the Béarnese pony, his two	246.98008775058372
auditors laughed even louder than before, and he himself, though	214.17854373514788
contrary to his custom, allowed a pale smile (if I may be allowed to	325.69367115846467
use such an expression) to stray over his countenance. This time there	198.45419401667428
could be no doubt; D’Artagnan was really insulted. Full, then, of this	355.805028880926
conviction, he pulled his cap down over his eyes, and endeavoring to	227.11035716531035
copy some of the court airs he had picked up in Gascony among young	260.42265281645825
traveling nobles, he advanced with one hand on the hilt of his sword	176.12542710915974
and the other resting on his hip. Unfortunately, as he advanced, his	304.4284083654958
anger increased at every step; and instead of the proper and lofty	264.4802560694887
speech he had prepared as a prelude to his challenge, he found nothing	257.74752762434866
at the tip of his tongue but a gross personality, which he accompanied	252.19110674572556
with a furious gesture.	225.27058262869906
“I say, sir, you sir, who are hiding yourself behind that shutter—yes,	313.04458181433733
you, sir, tell me what you are laughing at, and we will laugh	299.7768521578077
together!”	353.3928036341897
The gentleman raised his eyes slowly from the nag to his cavalier, as	309.4560076925907
if he required some time to ascertain whether it could be to him that	254.13045048346788
such strange reproaches were addressed; then, when he could not	238.10331067335562
possibly entertain any doubt of the matter, his eyebrows slightly bent,	189.21519151116198
and with an accent of irony and insolence impossible to be described,	302.30061659266994
he replied to D’Artagnan, “I was not speaking to you, sir.”	309.2274783137136
“But I am speaking to you!” replied the young man, additionally	337.17889066742083
exasperated with this mixture of insolence and good manners, of	226.15392615888666
politeness and scorn.	194.02733567320024
The stranger looked at him again with a slight smile, and retiring from	185.81296486700188
the window, came out of the hostelry with a slow step, and placed	247.50774287069586
himself before the horse, within two paces of D’Artagnan. His quiet	325.60351392145094
manner and the ironical expression of his countenance redoubled the	275.0108577993483
mirth of the persons with whom he had been talking, and who still	365.9480599112491
remained at the window.	332.1329943966782
D’Artagnan, seeing him approach, drew his sword a foot out of the	350.40765038358904
scabbard.	342.7291269887137
“This horse is decidedly, or rather has been in his youth, a	211.50052034835778
buttercup,” resumed the stranger, continuing the remarks he had begun,	293.27300272539685
and addressing himself to his auditors at the window, without paying	211.1481134939272
the least attention to the exasperation of D’Artagnan, who, however,	213.73531706674763
placed himself between him and them. “It is a color very well known in	274.28535737894344
botany, but till the present time very rare among horses.”	328.5729709326778
“There are people who laugh at the horse that would not dare to laugh	225.02742597914033
at the master,” cried the young emulator of the furious Tréville.	331.7254211537437
“I do not often laugh, sir,” replied the stranger, “as you may perceive	273.8954112261671
by the expression of my countenance; but nevertheless I retain the	279.1333383235963
privilege of laughing when I please.”	277.75888406239955
“And I,” cried D’Artagnan, “will allow no man to laugh when it	323.19287505400666
displeases me!”	276.7461053007066
“Indeed, sir,” continued the stranger, more calm than ever; “well, that	226.8529864972315
is perfectly right!” and turning on his heel, was about to re-enter the	322.5125611079477
hostelry by the front gate, beneath which D’Artagnan on arriving had	330.0388673367524
observed a saddled horse.	219.51367769694517
But, D’Artagnan was not of a character to allow a man to escape him	195.60142799434843
thus who had the insolence to ridicule him. He drew his sword entirely	249.8104308874003
from the scabbard, and followed him, crying, “Turn, turn, Master Joker,	303.3811348591039
lest I strike you behind!”	192.5614019313436
“Strike me!” said the other, turning on his heels, and surveying the	240.68485557624678
young man with as much astonishment as contempt. “Why, my good fellow,	369.3270943197284
you must be mad!” Then, in a suppressed tone, as if speaking to	336.67666207504794
himself, “This is annoying,” continued he. “What a godsend this would	303.1969562243605
be for his Majesty, who is seeking everywhere for brave fellows to	321.2935863979733
recruit for his Musketeers!”	279.1328708855847
He had scarcely finished, when D’Artagnan made such a furious lunge at	223.49300187308404
him that if he had not sprung nimbly backward, it is probable he would	276.014560127306
have jested for the last time. The stranger, then perceiving that the	185.73943553529458
matter went beyond raillery, drew his sword, saluted his adversary, and	266.7170724689143
seriously placed himself on guard. But at the same moment, his two	223.1712927849052
auditors, accompanied by the host, fell upon D’Artagnan with sticks,	225.49986902862733
shovels and tongs. This caused so rapid and complete a diversion from	182.83631390798115
the attack that D’Artagnan’s adversary, while the latter turned round	267.62313595968936
to face this shower of blows, sheathed his sword with the same	349.8426275656889
precision, and instead of an actor, which he had nearly been, became a	284.3098882845722
spectator of the fight—a part in which he acquitted himself with his	293.52787925557027
usual impassiveness, muttering, nevertheless, “A plague upon these	245.00972160569063
Gascons! Replace him on his orange horse, and let him begone!”	301.11603250659374
“Not before I have killed you, poltroon!” cried D’Artagnan, making the	196.09571618175787
best face possible, and never retreating one step before his three	203.6955215833431
assailants, who continued to shower blows upon him.	175.77494109573408
“Another gasconade!” murmured the gentleman. “By my honor, these	179.96197067170203
Gascons are incorrigible! Keep up the dance, then, since he will have	328.58492812144056
it so. When he is tired, he will perhaps tell us that he has had enough	364.9906182761025
of it.”	345.7821127518204
But the stranger knew not the headstrong personage he had to do with;	335.1312606553553
D’Artagnan was not the man ever to cry for quarter. The fight was	367.02921684751726
therefore prolonged for some seconds; but at length D’Artagnan dropped	370.404641392583
his sword, which was broken in two pieces by the blow of a stick.	367.33082526424715
Another blow full upon his forehead at the same moment brought him to	331.59793698478853
the ground, covered with blood and almost fainting.	213.6962838740758
It was at this moment that people came flocking to the scene of action	359.1290766655627
from all sides. The host, fearful of consequences, with the help of his	280.4902575259872
servants carried the wounded man into the kitchen, where some trifling	356.0474445992529
attentions were bestowed upon him.	267.5130008685363
As to the gentleman, he resumed his place at the window, and surveyed	224.78773571320062
the crowd with a certain impatience, evidently annoyed by their	304.05202169062
remaining undispersed.	178.712860457391
“Well, how is it with this madman?” exclaimed he, turning round as the	218.15387820745943
noise of the door announced the entrance of the host, who came in to	331.5421611493658
inquire if he was unhurt.	268.18952097247916
“Your Excellency is safe and sound?” asked the host.	271.4796605799522
“Oh, yes! Perfectly safe and sound, my good host; and I wish to know	255.80695579842106
what has become of our young man.”	185.55976245074726
“He is better,” said the host, “he fainted quite away.”	197.56320529865374
“Indeed!” said the gentleman.	185.05824424751435
“But before he fainted, he collected all his strength to challenge you,	178.6446488943036
and to defy you while challenging you.”	356.70887631163976
“Why, this fellow must be the devil in person!” cried the stranger.	306.4871534482698
“Oh, no, your Excellency, he is not the devil,” replied the host, with	346.5123143062378
a grin of contempt; “for during his fainting we rummaged his valise and	258.85408051486286
found nothing but a clean shirt and eleven crowns—which however, did	200.00136698644917
not prevent his saying, as he was fainting, that if such a thing had	211.75001923693583
happened in Paris, you should have cause to repent of it at a later	330.054181185267
period.”	193.47433977219927
“Then,” said the stranger coolly, “he must be some prince in disguise.”	245.63386494605024
“I have told you this, good sir,” resumed the host, “in order that you	207.8178381417745
may be on your guard.”	204.03055784256287
“Did he name no one in his passion?”	358.07168583433986
“Yes; he struck his pocket and said, ‘We shall see what Monsieur de	341.0627515219038
Tréville will think of this insult offered to his _protégé_.’”	334.79386664706345
“Monsieur de Tréville?” said the stranger, becoming attentive, “he put	330.0666100914634
his hand upon his pocket while pronouncing the name of Monsieur de	332.67983497180205
Tréville? Now, my dear host, while your young man was insensible, you	249.75649550890253
did not fail, I am quite sure, to ascertain what that pocket contained.	355.1265591795909
What was there in it?”	189.8761389246538
“A letter addressed to Monsieur de Tréville, captain of the	273.87423995161134
Musketeers.”	208.9071936964839
“Indeed!”	347.8782207554368
“Exactly as I have the honor to tell your Excellency.”	264.9391683180378
The host, who was not endowed with great perspicacity, did not observe	238.68070969869842
the expression which his words had given to the physiognomy of the	368.3387641970286
stranger. The latter rose from the front of the window, upon the sill	368.1533983016102
of which he had leaned with his elbow, and knitted his brow like a man	330.3314229629185
disquieted.	291.45035918069834
“The devil!” murmured he, between his teeth. “Can Tréville have set	201.21091565335678
this Gascon upon me? He is very young; but a sword thrust is a sword	334.04743207215597
thrust, whatever be the age of him who gives it, and a youth is less to	294.4780860368023
be suspected than an older man,” and the stranger fell into a reverie	256.48740050289916
which lasted some minutes. “A weak obstacle is sometimes sufficient to	317.6495016793008
overthrow a great design.	322.96328277153077
“Host,” said he, “could you not contrive to get rid of this frantic boy	322.70457135104897
for me? In conscience, I cannot kill him; and yet,” added he, with a	241.72764054387648
coldly menacing expression, “he annoys me. Where is he?”	321.5199676985529
“In my wife’s chamber, on the first flight, where they are dressing his	248.03764908249389
wounds.”	255.12292200961207
“His things and his bag are with him? Has he taken off his doublet?”	194.61407942339045
“On the contrary, everything is in the kitchen. But if he annoys you,	284.030759911582
this young fool—”	173.9380813836485
“To be sure he does. He causes a disturbance in your hostelry, which	202.7147355539957
respectable people cannot put up with. Go; make out my bill and notify	174.61226027661212
my servant.”	201.71123217605998
“What, monsieur, will you leave us so soon?”	360.5629413750096
“You know that very well, as I gave my order to saddle my horse. Have	362.7514353512588
they not obeyed me?”	350.79184569951826
“It is done; as your Excellency may have observed, your horse is in the	242.09495571634307
great gateway, ready saddled for your departure.”	236.09996795923925
“That is well; do as I have directed you, then.”	275.00274665650454
“What the devil!” said the host to himself. “Can he be afraid of this	178.72781510582453
boy?” But an imperious glance from the stranger stopped him short; he	204.2398437534628
bowed humbly and retired.	344.62261535636793
“It is not necessary for Milady* to be seen by this fellow,” continued	250.91564526180673
the stranger. “She will soon pass; she is already late. I had better	316.4249899220881
get on horseback, and go and meet her. I should like, however, to know	257.9545347047814
what this letter addressed to Tréville contains.” And the stranger,	261.31734257740516
muttering to himself, directed his steps toward the kitchen.	362.7391296389997
* We are well aware that this term, milady, is only properly used when	318.72422373220434
followed by a family name. But we find it thus in the manuscript, and	263.2427986435243
we do not choose to take upon ourselves to alter it.	186.8399168015841
In the meantime, the host, who entertained no doubt that it was the	193.9208345236097
presence of the young man that drove the stranger from his hostelry,	344.00952531941186
re-ascended to his wife’s chamber, and found D’Artagnan just recovering	295.76709904616644
his senses. Giving him to understand that the police would deal with	346.7236883325529
him pretty severely for having sought a quarrel with a great lord—for	340.2961029574092
in the opinion of the host the stranger could be nothing less than a	251.52792956025272
great lord—he insisted that notwithstanding his weakness D’Artagnan	172.68135031387166
should get up and depart as quickly as possible. D’Artagnan, half	195.4120633850917
stupefied, without his doublet, and with his head bound up in a linen	350.45772636435163
cloth, arose then, and urged by the host, began to descend the stairs;	293.1263832562122
but on arriving at the kitchen, the first thing he saw was his	231.19162626231758
antagonist talking calmly at the step of a heavy carriage, drawn by two	258.090507124046
large Norman horses.	262.17611558381014
His interlocutor, whose head appeared through the carriage window, was	171.50394067381575
a woman of from twenty to two-and-twenty years. We have already	208.26433323242063
observed with what rapidity D’Artagnan seized the expression of a	364.21043336913647
countenance. He perceived then, at a glance, that this woman was young	283.92047617582483
and beautiful; and her style of beauty struck him more forcibly from	236.28159655699133
its being totally different from that of the southern countries in	196.72738063149217
which D’Artagnan had hitherto resided. She was pale and fair, with long	306.8838494364382
curls falling in profusion over her shoulders, had large, blue,	299.4545036577937
languishing eyes, rosy lips, and hands of alabaster. She was talking	217.76183012942522
with great animation with the stranger.	224.538576720635
“His Eminence, then, orders me—” said the lady.	254.9013629385259
“To return instantly to England, and to inform him as soon as the duke	172.81910763212178
leaves London.”	199.6209472626351
“And as to my other instructions?” asked the fair traveler.	200.31223563817733
“They are contained in this box, which you will not open until you are	320.4137768251125
on the other side of the Channel.”	179.7516121048543
“Very well; and you—what will you do?”	190.96961728254183
“I—I return to Paris.”	354.7445977138248
“What, without chastising this insolent boy?” asked the lady.	188.20913603872182
The stranger was about to reply; but at the moment he opened his mouth,	214.33813093392877
D’Artagnan, who had heard all, precipitated himself over the threshold	283.1767445721777
of the door.	337.7821470244936
“This insolent boy chastises others,” cried he; “and I hope that this	305.66446698331094
time he whom he ought to chastise will not escape him as before.”	176.9985266789957
“Will not escape him?” replied the stranger, knitting his brow.	367.4830210168858
“No; before a woman you would dare not fly, I presume?”	364.86628088401983
“Remember,” said Milady, seeing the stranger lay his hand on his sword,	223.96431839895598
“the least delay may ruin everything.”	262.43945849763315
“You are right,” cried the gentleman; “begone then, on your part, and I	295.9037511666459
will depart as quickly on mine.” And bowing to the lady, he sprang into	363.1084332502612
his saddle, while her coachman applied his whip vigorously to his	253.3371555761755
horses. The two interlocutors thus separated, taking opposite	283.53733753630615
directions, at full gallop.	282.9298365880441
“Pay him, booby!” cried the stranger to his servant, without checking	237.46173515757738
the speed of his horse; and the man, after throwing two or three silver	322.8204146839256
pieces at the foot of mine host, galloped after his master.	332.9872447501284
“Base coward! false gentleman!” cried D’Artagnan, springing forward, in	189.6782051071675
his turn, after the servant. But his wound had rendered him too weak to	257.09895683663785
support such an exertion. Scarcely had he gone ten steps when his ears	324.4412253915689
began to tingle, a faintness seized him, a cloud of blood passed over	216.55699927580005
his eyes, and he fell in the middle of the street, crying still,	361.8736470321435
“Coward! coward! coward!”	193.96009601045438
“He is a coward, indeed,” grumbled the host, drawing near to	354.27742954375134
D’Artagnan, and endeavoring by this little flattery to make up matters	360.39993100011066
with the young man, as the heron of the fable did with the snail he had	337.47693866294446
despised the evening before.	279.49150159773814
“Yes, a base coward,” murmured D’Artagnan; “but she—she was very	289.7944247087287
beautiful.”	193.36700064267944
“What _she?_” demanded the host.	241.36060895699381
“Milady,” faltered D’Artagnan, and fainted a second time.	288.1138019187324
“Ah, it’s all one,” said the host; “I have lost two customers, but this	229.92577804588984
one remains, of whom I am pretty certain for some days to come. There	268.9228633826144
will be eleven crowns gained.”	249.55130461227122
It is to be remembered that eleven crowns was just the sum that	261.94941346306115
remained in D’Artagnan’s purse.	289.12794248036516
The host had reckoned upon eleven days of confinement at a crown a day,	363.6190463959306
but he had reckoned without his guest. On the following morning at five	194.89932398089175
o’clock D’Artagnan arose, and descending to the kitchen without help,	285.6370854609779
asked, among other ingredients the list of which has not come down to	354.9456072623555
us, for some oil, some wine, and some rosemary, and with his mother’s	304.5893724812581
recipe in his hand composed a balsam, with which he anointed his	194.88304694706497
numerous wounds, replacing his bandages himself, and positively	333.9971287115437
refusing the assistance of any doctor, D’Artagnan walked about that	272.8294587189573
same evening, and was almost cured by the morrow.	293.65061796816764
But when the time came to pay for his rosemary, this oil, and the wine,	318.29991757763116
the only expense the master had incurred, as he had preserved a strict	288.08506277099855
abstinence—while on the contrary, the yellow horse, by the account of	199.49575126765077
the hostler at least, had eaten three times as much as a horse of his	322.9065025484527
size could reasonably be supposed to have done—D’Artagnan found nothing	274.41201687527524
in his pocket but his little old velvet purse with the eleven crowns it	366.29712903911104
contained; for as to the letter addressed to M. de Tréville, it had	276.23941752605185
disappeared.	337.408764445069
The young man commenced his search for the letter with the greatest	290.22288982013697
patience, turning out his pockets of all kinds over and over again,	353.77960420308966
rummaging and rerummaging in his valise, and opening and reopening his	239.6416410844782
purse; but when he found that he had come to the conviction that the	213.9446384757564
letter was not to be found, he flew, for the third time, into such a	327.0723319573852
rage as was near costing him a fresh consumption of wine, oil, and	236.17395670255524
rosemary—for upon seeing this hot-headed youth become exasperated and	236.61845089092324
threaten to destroy everything in the establishment if his letter were	269.6148280858522
not found, the host seized a spit, his wife a broom handle, and the	350.01638355894585
servants the same sticks they had used the day before.	287.42047009582126
“My letter of recommendation!” cried D’Artagnan, “my letter of	201.9355988600121
recommendation! or, the holy blood, I will spit you all like ortolans!”	337.61700486475524
Unfortunately, there was one circumstance which created a powerful	291.67891332210917
obstacle to the accomplishment of this threat; which was, as we have	181.4313219583414
related, that his sword had been in his first conflict broken in two,	259.2879578194417
and which he had entirely forgotten. Hence, it resulted when D’Artagnan	232.3406115393527
proceeded to draw his sword in earnest, he found himself purely and	317.08790663650615
simply armed with a stump of a sword about eight or ten inches in	249.62421484178356
length, which the host had carefully placed in the scabbard. As to the	294.2752939051162
rest of the blade, the master had slyly put that on one side to make	308.7204308461874
himself a larding pin.	174.66994409409693
But this deception would probably not have stopped our fiery young man	366.6053652001621
if the host had not reflected that the reclamation which his guest made	336.466940295989
was perfectly just.	336.21805270358846
“But, after all,” said he, lowering the point of his spit, “where is	243.36343850397606
this letter?”	363.48727967173807
“Yes, where is this letter?” cried D’Artagnan. “In the first place, I	179.04362643827773
warn you that that letter is for Monsieur de Tréville, and it must be	366.0039902202849
found, or if it is not found, he will know how to find it.”	313.13998241905733
His threat completed the intimidation of the host. After the king and	324.7466220513318
the cardinal, M. de Tréville was the man whose name was perhaps most	300.943211364444
frequently repeated by the military, and even by citizens. There was,	214.50642073931235
to be sure, Father Joseph, but his name was never pronounced but with a	210.75390405977927
subdued voice, such was the terror inspired by his Gray Eminence, as	321.12893120072727
the cardinal’s familiar was called.	198.175807919573
Throwing down his spit, and ordering his wife to do the same with her	265.49057580523754
broom handle, and the servants with their sticks, he set the first	192.1484974716593
example of commencing an earnest search for the lost letter.	213.07674567816022
“Does the letter contain anything valuable?” demanded the host, after a	278.9972414804451
few minutes of useless investigation.	314.9674497588644
“Zounds! I think it does indeed!” cried the Gascon, who reckoned upon	230.95920390324738
this letter for making his way at court. “It contained my fortune!”	365.53172514646116
“Bills upon Spain?” asked the disturbed host.	296.53106145914074
“Bills upon his Majesty’s private treasury,” answered D’Artagnan, who,	236.60283489898694
reckoning upon entering into the king’s service in consequence of this	355.6542018581556
recommendation, believed he could make this somewhat hazardous reply	326.1017964103721
without telling of a falsehood.	304.2561285756655
“The devil!” cried the host, at his wits’ end.	250.92416359435578
“But it’s of no importance,” continued D’Artagnan, with natural	264.5933191004775
assurance; “it’s of no importance. The money is nothing; that letter	283.59126383777914
was everything. I would rather have lost a thousand pistoles than have	176.43397241171928
lost it.” He would not have risked more if he had said twenty thousand;	273.9099929912608
but a certain juvenile modesty restrained him.	261.76254540950697
A ray of light all at once broke upon the mind of the host as he was	299.498924825868
giving himself to the devil upon finding nothing.	329.79728972314325
“That letter is not lost!” cried he.	337.0989058188318
“What!” cried D’Artagnan.	283.32411765432437
“No, it has been stolen from you.”	316.7878232657108
“Stolen? By whom?”	264.2695532833064
“By the gentleman who was here yesterday. He came down into the	342.0429062013758
kitchen, where your doublet was. He remained there some time alone. I	329.5563527457482
would lay a wager he has stolen it.”	201.13091164209726
“Do you think so?” answered D’Artagnan, but little convinced, as he	225.88999971243643
knew better than anyone else how entirely personal the value of this	197.9249256019766
letter was, and saw nothing in it likely to tempt cupidity. The fact	260.6504870158779
was that none of his servants, none of the travelers present, could	362.4347642522501
have gained anything by being possessed of this paper.	241.84799570769403
“Do you say,” resumed D’Artagnan, “that you suspect that impertinent	254.88696911960517
gentleman?”	220.60303687388296
“I tell you I am sure of it,” continued the host. “When I informed him	293.47787705669174
that your lordship was the _protégé_ of Monsieur de Tréville, and that	345.6326088591997
you even had a letter for that illustrious gentleman, he appeared to be	260.4150761056258
very much disturbed, and asked me where that letter was, and	214.93091942452472
immediately came down into the kitchen, where he knew your doublet	180.16997841021967
was.”	286.32480586861516
“Then that’s my thief,” replied D’Artagnan. “I will complain to	327.6315121621964
Monsieur de Tréville, and Monsieur de Tréville will complain to the	220.31551076179338
king.” He then drew two crowns majestically from his purse and gave	249.09592077142435
them to the host, who accompanied him, cap in hand, to the gate, and	297.02184253212215
remounted his yellow horse, which bore him without any further accident	308.92983709754225
to the gate of St. Antoine at Paris, where his owner sold him for three	262.1866747297637
crowns, which was a very good price, considering that D’Artagnan had	299.9012843465516
ridden him hard during the last stage. Thus the dealer to whom	269.1932531801071
D’Artagnan sold him for the nine livres did not conceal from the young	370.7598009416582
man that he only gave that enormous sum for him on the account of the	275.6432888097849
originality of his color.	234.31504137720523
Thus D’Artagnan entered Paris on foot, carrying his little packet under	232.96715592042835
his arm, and walked about till he found an apartment to be let on terms	346.3021545914811
suited to the scantiness of his means. This chamber was a sort of	218.2431974262907
garret, situated in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, near the Luxembourg.	307.27511930684
As soon as the earnest money was paid, D’Artagnan took possession of	356.5742309355213
his lodging, and passed the remainder of the day in sewing onto his	352.4821230214935
doublet and hose some ornamental braiding which his mother had taken	251.08015178992747
off an almost-new doublet of the elder M. d’Artagnan, and which she had	255.5391936027417
given her son secretly. Next he went to the Quai de Feraille to have a	272.6916241873781
new blade put to his sword, and then returned toward the Louvre,	276.73033013544796
inquiring of the first Musketeer he met for the situation of the hôtel	205.5343566187222
of M. de Tréville, which proved to be in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier;	250.04422502961023
that is to say, in the immediate vicinity of the chamber hired by	340.1637255221365
D’Artagnan—a circumstance which appeared to furnish a happy augury for	292.2484482717846
the success of his journey.	365.67008460304663
After this, satisfied with the way in which he had conducted himself at	207.28928625147051
Meung, without remorse for the past, confident in the present, and full	224.94536906654713
of hope for the future, he retired to bed and slept the sleep of the	367.7172769290539
brave.	312.34465287264027
This sleep, provincial as it was, brought him to nine o’clock in the	358.7184030872678
morning; at which hour he rose, in order to repair to the residence of	322.5737629543246
M. de Tréville, the third personage in the kingdom, in the paternal	217.23412395659398
estimation.	253.45436499773808
Chapter II.	201.71307636248264
THE ANTECHAMBER OF M. DE TRÉVILLE	333.796786761834
M. de Troisville, as his family was still called in Gascony, or M. de	272.4740443831889
Tréville, as he has ended by styling himself in Paris, had really	351.19511665114067
commenced life as D’Artagnan now did; that is to say, without a sou in	360.86139089444913
his pocket, but with a fund of audacity, shrewdness, and intelligence	243.41021682208273
which makes the poorest Gascon gentleman often derive more in his hope	242.1477024505863
from the paternal inheritance than the richest Perigordian or Berrichan	179.7916811025611
gentleman derives in reality from his. His insolent bravery, his still	278.97604984958855
more insolent success at a time when blows poured down like hail, had	219.05777300447784
borne him to the top of that difficult ladder called Court Favor, which	205.57749317148597
he had climbed four steps at a time.	218.32834616575946
He was the friend of the king, who honored highly, as everyone knows,	336.1955937961401
the memory of his father, Henry IV. The father of M. de Tréville had	267.7978193882105
served him so faithfully in his wars against the league that in default	197.67776349629943
of money—a thing to which the Béarnais was accustomed all his life, and	304.2205897336903
who constantly paid his debts with that of which he never stood in need	350.16259237990545
of borrowing, that is to say, with ready wit—in default of money, we	339.22707181426915
repeat, he authorized him, after the reduction of Paris, to assume for	298.82759534816245
his arms a golden lion passant upon gules, with the motto _Fidelis et	345.3221711890209
fortis_. This was a great matter in the way of honor, but very little	258.8212440517799
in the way of wealth; so that when the illustrious companion of the	213.37704914991573
great Henry died, the only inheritance he was able to leave his son was	308.0836693608146
his sword and his motto. Thanks to this double gift and the spotless	245.59389983892225
name that accompanied it, M. de Tréville was admitted into the	179.76664623027415
household of the young prince where he made such good use of his sword,	341.5971564183714
and was so faithful to his motto, that Louis XIII., one of the good	300.3013397378431
blades of his kingdom, was accustomed to say that if he had a friend	192.70743317913
who was about to fight, he would advise him to choose as a second,	279.67976470137023
himself first, and Tréville next—or even, perhaps, before himself.	275.41590524423003
Thus Louis XIII. had a real liking for Tréville—a royal liking, a	258.62828069297166
self-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. At that unhappy	314.28860546931026
period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men	216.68387736497814
as Tréville. Many might take for their device the epithet _strong_,	189.05466481234595
which formed the second part of his motto, but very few gentlemen could	246.0848793571916
lay claim to the _faithful_, which constituted the first. Tréville was	200.00699017990195
one of these latter. His was one of those rare organizations, endowed	368.4348036026397
with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor,	321.15248598717153
a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given	196.72024687782576
to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to	341.52957870445505
strike this displeasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a	363.5730530731164
Poltiot de Méré, or a Vitry. In short, up to this period nothing had	260.5528681639512
been wanting to Tréville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch	273.67169237535114
for it, and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to	175.43564592823085
seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand.	195.17545408307726
At last Louis XIII. made Tréville the captain of his Musketeers, who	339.816212556409
were to Louis XIII. in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his	357.3067557380052
Ordinaries had been to Henry III., and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI.	240.7398510452054
On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When	340.02756898976133
he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII. had	361.87372704808575
surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France,	181.72731781020363
became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his	335.89141238867865
Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII. had his, and these two powerful	275.2233803884477
rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the	352.31657188225716
provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most	334.8773270519866
celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII.	190.49672232637585
to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their	189.35788219524733
servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people.	282.2126529000453
While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them	237.75430251028493
secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine	201.40622736724308
regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn	278.47259930758617
this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these	366.6418743516889
defeats and in many of these victories.	205.64250363620323
Tréville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this	207.23431658956758
address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not	312.18217792029395
left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his	189.71392439213787
friendships. He paraded his Musketeers before the Cardinal Armand	343.44289507486906
Duplessis with an insolent air which made the gray moustache of his	206.66542275260204
Eminence curl with ire. Tréville understood admirably the war method of	258.550153685126
that period, in which he who could not live at the expense of the enemy	301.2715866396003
must live at the expense of his compatriots. His soldiers formed a	319.0657951431358
legion of devil-may-care fellows, perfectly undisciplined toward all	359.87672205170117
but himself.	267.4209401047368
Loose, half-drunk, imposing, the king’s Musketeers, or rather M. de	179.39287328138704
Tréville’s, spread themselves about in the cabarets, in the public	224.49878589556008
walks, and the public sports, shouting, twisting their mustaches,	173.61129817391384
clanking their swords, and taking great pleasure in annoying the Guards	198.8991687305529
of the cardinal whenever they could fall in with them; then drawing in	298.8047204451659
the open streets, as if it were the best of all possible sports;	321.3340670392538
sometimes killed, but sure in that case to be both wept and avenged;	186.06561128379056
often killing others, but then certain of not rotting in prison, M. de	297.0330211023255
Tréville being there to claim them. Thus M. de Tréville was praised to	203.54843057524434
the highest note by these men, who adored him, and who, ruffians as	236.94759663665843
they were, trembled before him like scholars before their master,	226.3770746820905
obedient to his least word, and ready to sacrifice themselves to wash	358.60516749645785
out the smallest insult.	267.4161577470883
M. de Tréville employed this powerful weapon for the king, in the first	228.80157497986357
place, and the friends of the king—and then for himself and his own	293.13479175066385
friends. For the rest, in the memoirs of this period, which has left so	192.45798777091485
many memoirs, one does not find this worthy gentleman blamed even by	235.27275599084538
his enemies; and he had many such among men of the pen as well as among	325.0282233109434
men of the sword. In no instance, let us say, was this worthy gentleman	224.6947918452636
accused of deriving personal advantage from the cooperation of his	295.57791400030385
minions. Endowed with a rare genius for intrigue which rendered him the	235.82535060265656
equal of the ablest intriguers, he remained an honest man. Still	237.83926186375024
further, in spite of sword thrusts which weaken, and painful exercises	218.1929790740052
which fatigue, he had become one of the most gallant frequenters of	230.4448548227351
revels, one of the most insinuating lady’s men, one of the softest	330.9276873518166
whisperers of interesting nothings of his day; the _bonnes fortunes_ of	281.11642160056175
de Tréville were talked of as those of M. de Bassompierre had been	361.34133705241806
talked of twenty years before, and that was not saying a little. The	310.5308768973165
captain of the Musketeers was therefore admired, feared, and loved; and	252.99965644610046
this constitutes the zenith of human fortune.	179.82903377458706
Louis XIV. absorbed all the smaller stars of his court in his own vast	367.0751416978395
radiance; but his father, a sun _pluribus impar_, left his personal	334.16602475137444
splendor to each of his favorites, his individual value to each of his	216.24660611739313
courtiers. In addition to the levees of the king and the cardinal,	203.54766807646791
there might be reckoned in Paris at that time more than two hundred	342.19779733864823
smaller but still noteworthy levees. Among these two hundred levees,	236.73909485189398
that of Tréville was one of the most sought.	206.94122374017172
The court of his hôtel, situated in the Rue du Vieux-Colombier,	316.9541594831312
resembled a camp from by six o’clock in the morning in summer and eight	257.31400231503574
o’clock in winter. From fifty to sixty Musketeers, who appeared to	264.8215542573603
replace one another in order always to present an imposing number,	195.1685454996867
paraded constantly, armed to the teeth and ready for anything. On one	179.78947860401803
of those immense staircases, upon whose space modern civilization would	351.99797468704935
build a whole house, ascended and descended the office seekers of	341.9821493612052
Paris, who ran after any sort of favor—gentlemen from the provinces	210.04800739667738
anxious to be enrolled, and servants in all sorts of liveries, bringing	193.60925202927172
and carrying messages between their masters and M. de Tréville. In the	240.97323492525743
antechamber, upon long circular benches, reposed the elect; that is to	240.6603167800045
say, those who were called. In this apartment a continued buzzing	230.1603420667036
prevailed from morning till night, while M. de Tréville, in his office	346.4650982325372
contiguous to this antechamber, received visits, listened to	225.47492987096524
complaints, gave his orders, and like the king in his balcony at the	347.89440558852533
Louvre, had only to place himself at the window to review both his men	339.64488373753727
and arms.	347.6058481035668
The day on which D’Artagnan presented himself the assemblage was	294.6169708682877
imposing, particularly for a provincial just arriving from his	254.95395689536537
province. It is true that this provincial was a Gascon; and that,	279.6403110681464
particularly at this period, the compatriots of D’Artagnan had the	220.71745806337088
reputation of not being easily intimidated. When he had once passed the	308.5324811940257
massive door covered with long square-headed nails, he fell into the	182.92367964107274
midst of a troop of swordsmen, who crossed one another in their	364.7798833781608
passage, calling out, quarreling, and playing tricks one with another.	173.37905754526773
In order to make one’s way amid these turbulent and conflicting waves,	265.0092185207927
it was necessary to be an officer, a great noble, or a pretty woman.	275.99875128020966
It was, then, into the midst of this tumult and disorder that our young	301.3263080962097
man advanced with a beating heart, ranging his long rapier up his lanky	283.0680291284812
leg, and keeping one hand on the edge of his cap, with that half-smile	247.29536471901395
of the embarrassed provincial who wishes to put on a good face. When he	224.12948116165242
had passed one group he began to breathe more freely; but he could not	338.43786679511607
help observing that they turned round to look at him, and for the first	299.4641250008351
time in his life D’Artagnan, who had till that day entertained a very	319.5725497463329
good opinion of himself, felt ridiculous.	253.93902427766017
Arrived at the staircase, it was still worse. There were four	250.67357504950854
Musketeers on the bottom steps, amusing themselves with the following	207.00002678192507
exercise, while ten or twelve of their comrades waited upon the landing	303.72366352462666
place to take their turn in the sport.	280.994165999133
One of them, stationed upon the top stair, naked sword in hand,	249.39113145349117
prevented, or at least endeavored to prevent, the three others from	177.82250014560324
ascending.	319.91030541903564
These three others fenced against him with their agile swords.	337.36023437467884
D’Artagnan at first took these weapons for foils, and believed them to	295.99243256079126
be buttoned; but he soon perceived by certain scratches that every	179.57738256762025
weapon was pointed and sharpened, and that at each of these scratches	350.9829851702381
not only the spectators, but even the actors themselves, laughed like	340.7288604874409
so many madmen.	329.43385626782526
He who at the moment occupied the upper step kept his adversaries	341.23881177167357
marvelously in check. A circle was formed around them. The conditions	293.96166017771975
required that at every hit the man touched should quit the game,	197.19262430030176
yielding his turn for the benefit of the adversary who had hit him. In	295.6343617519414
five minutes three were slightly wounded, one on the hand, another on	308.0871570332132
the ear, by the defender of the stair, who himself remained intact—a	205.95036280600627
piece of skill which was worth to him, according to the rules agreed	317.10000391226714
upon, three turns of favor.	311.88549836709603
However difficult it might be, or rather as he pretended it was, to	327.7026815951706
astonish our young traveler, this pastime really astonished him. He had	303.60430463556577
seen in his province—that land in which heads become so easily heated—a	250.67598529239694
few of the preliminaries of duels; but the daring of these four fencers	307.92575464302263
appeared to him the strongest he had ever heard of even in Gascony. He	210.02223879522813
believed himself transported into that famous country of giants into	252.06244345077587
which Gulliver afterward went and was so frightened; and yet he had not	314.1178387247169
gained the goal, for there were still the landing place and the	337.00047093246906
antechamber.	257.04329452697016
On the landing they were no longer fighting, but amused themselves with	337.9550815156136
stories about women, and in the antechamber, with stories about the	343.57184166944415
court. On the landing D’Artagnan blushed; in the antechamber he	274.93770846127694
trembled. His warm and fickle imagination, which in Gascony had	270.33690619824574
rendered him formidable to young chambermaids, and even sometimes their	240.71777668871079
mistresses, had never dreamed, even in moments of delirium, of half the	342.40433006215096
amorous wonders or a quarter of the feats of gallantry which were here	244.65191693797573
set forth in connection with names the best known and with details the	284.5374708264746
least concealed. But if his morals were shocked on the landing, his	259.60086663696677
respect for the cardinal was scandalized in the antechamber. There, to	287.03022143934686
his great astonishment, D’Artagnan heard the policy which made all	200.3353638972316
Europe tremble criticized aloud and openly, as well as the private life	266.21357089920565
of the cardinal, which so many great nobles had been punished for	248.76345208812904
trying to pry into. That great man who was so revered by D’Artagnan the	224.03890239978756
elder served as an object of ridicule to the Musketeers of Tréville,	298.81194989887854
who cracked their jokes upon his bandy legs and his crooked back. Some	300.46202732460347
sang ballads about Mme. d’Aguillon, his mistress, and Mme. Cambalet,	301.893107099385
his niece; while others formed parties and plans to annoy the pages and	201.79060277274874
guards of the cardinal duke—all things which appeared to D’Artagnan	221.2471805906557
monstrous impossibilities.	311.52794463936334
Nevertheless, when the name of the king was now and then uttered	369.7325861086215
unthinkingly amid all these cardinal jests, a sort of gag seemed to	198.99274569827065
close for a moment on all these jeering mouths. They looked	226.78153848536087
hesitatingly around them, and appeared to doubt the thickness of the	241.73545595274408
partition between them and the office of M. de Tréville; but a fresh	207.8684807229745
allusion soon brought back the conversation to his Eminence, and then	214.24852144375254
the laughter recovered its loudness and the light was not withheld from	209.90878356846184
any of his actions.	189.0036100214806
“Certes, these fellows will all either be imprisoned or hanged,”	182.052072073711
thought the terrified D’Artagnan, “and I, no doubt, with them; for from	290.0056929808659
the moment I have either listened to or heard them, I shall be held as	192.69220067294802
an accomplice. What would my good father say, who so strongly pointed	259.59443964902954
out to me the respect due to the cardinal, if he knew I was in the	341.60325452001973
society of such pagans?”	239.53073929339888
We have no need, therefore, to say that D’Artagnan dared not join in	302.06937287318317
the conversation, only he looked with all his eyes and listened with	324.3885467309062
all his ears, stretching his five senses so as to lose nothing; and	309.6716411020644
despite his confidence on the paternal admonitions, he felt himself	280.56688969146984
carried by his tastes and led by his instincts to praise rather than to	327.8544156834414
blame the unheard-of things which were taking place.	196.43228610937788
Although he was a perfect stranger in the court of M. de Tréville’s	308.26983655397555
courtiers, and this his first appearance in that place, he was at	208.26162849649978
length noticed, and somebody came and asked him what he wanted. At this	318.6860323408529
demand D’Artagnan gave his name very modestly, emphasized the title of	206.44137352477867
compatriot, and begged the servant who had put the question to him to	201.76600194636373
request a moment’s audience of M. de Tréville—a request which the	322.03603166199423
other, with an air of protection, promised to transmit in due season.	193.90486026240168
D’Artagnan, a little recovered from his first surprise, had now leisure	250.74529614556613
to study costumes and physiognomy.	176.7919305161044
The center of the most animated group was a Musketeer of great height	360.2648645837032
and haughty countenance, dressed in a costume so peculiar as to attract	347.0802428986121
general attention. He did not wear the uniform cloak—which was not	250.19822004847407
obligatory at that epoch of less liberty but more independence—but a	201.1085047441066
cerulean-blue doublet, a little faded and worn, and over this a	210.25573095649338
magnificent baldric, worked in gold, which shone like water ripples in	327.52555816273014
the sun. A long cloak of crimson velvet fell in graceful folds from his	268.08142313409724
shoulders, disclosing in front the splendid baldric, from which was	315.2303815544559
suspended a gigantic rapier. This Musketeer had just come off guard,	202.73284995618005
complained of having a cold, and coughed from time to time affectedly.	313.3138110570245
It was for this reason, as he said to those around him, that he had put	247.69220313906615
on his cloak; and while he spoke with a lofty air and twisted his	209.43950175476047
mustache disdainfully, all admired his embroidered baldric, and	308.1359124177014
D’Artagnan more than anyone.	178.4741419254296
“What would you have?” said the Musketeer. “This fashion is coming in.	251.51934196645442
It is a folly, I admit, but still it is the fashion. Besides, one must	183.19842565626277
lay out one’s inheritance somehow.”	202.24705758643324
“Ah, Porthos!” cried one of his companions, “don’t try to make us	195.20610099218342
believe you obtained that baldric by paternal generosity. It was given	369.66216401836414
to you by that veiled lady I met you with the other Sunday, near the	209.7822829863323
gate St. Honoré.”	172.60002301782592
“No, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, I bought it with the	184.8218193755471
contents of my own purse,” answered he whom they designated by the name	359.25847464119386
Porthos.	276.5776685240139
“Yes; about in the same manner,” said another Musketeer, “that I bought	212.14781035393074
this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one.”	268.06946396161715
“It’s true, though,” said Porthos; “and the proof is that I paid twelve	232.65533337356385
pistoles for it.”	314.42742013357156
The wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.	180.6563692115237
“Is it not true, Aramis?” said Porthos, turning toward another	219.06117998041202
Musketeer.	221.64052636046415
This other Musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who	290.19570985625415
had just designated him by the name of Aramis. He was a stout man, of	239.57230002690812
about two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance, a	311.47702698106855
black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. His	277.5567056461619
delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;	359.0741471125432
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,	310.6043947220163
and he pinched the tips of his ears from time to time to preserve their	286.77775159238456
delicate pink transparency. Habitually he spoke little and slowly,	209.12053077297216
bowed frequently, laughed without noise, showing his teeth, which were	199.88334055783974
fine and of which, as the rest of his person, he appeared to take great	343.85093322374394
care. He answered the appeal of his friend by an affirmative nod of the	327.3605109278683
head.	197.39844966568805
This affirmation appeared to dispel all doubts with regard to the	249.11964640029254
baldric. They continued to admire it, but said no more about it; and	366.3250269186959
with a rapid change of thought, the conversation passed suddenly to	322.6235988374431
another subject.	232.68663416895328
“What do you think of the story Chalais’s esquire relates?” asked	247.7258331822769
another Musketeer, without addressing anyone in particular, but on the	185.96071388143008
contrary speaking to everybody.	225.0722926694387
“And what does he say?” asked Porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.	173.77676359486532
“He relates that he met at Brussels Rochefort, the _âme damnée_ of the	216.81539754780326
cardinal disguised as a Capuchin, and that this cursed Rochefort,	200.3076466644801
thanks to his disguise, had tricked Monsieur de Laigues, like a ninny	191.21168179215152
as he is.”	245.52148344532455
“A ninny, indeed!” said Porthos; “but is the matter certain?”	322.7283342585523
“I had it from Aramis,” replied the Musketeer.	180.6709440500204
“Indeed?”	348.9117132785551
“Why, you knew it, Porthos,” said Aramis. “I told you of it yesterday.	300.55735831925915
Let us say no more about it.”	305.4098004006299
“Say no more about it? That’s _your_ opinion!” replied Porthos.	368.8251966791652
“Say no more about it! _Peste!_ You come to your conclusions quickly.	328.29176026618484
What! The cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen	298.2206385314081
from him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal—has, with the help	226.6991232996753
of this spy and thanks to this correspondence, Chalais’s throat cut,	290.27269217316586
under the stupid pretext that he wanted to kill the king and marry	355.82574508086077
Monsieur to the queen! Nobody knew a word of this enigma. You unraveled	229.52562380595327
it yesterday to the great satisfaction of all; and while we are still	190.2966945656789
gaping with wonder at the news, you come and tell us today, ‘Let us say	293.67402589925484
no more about it.’”	176.78589819021323
“Well, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it,” replied	267.87498086436216
Aramis, patiently.	325.8464702578079
“This Rochefort,” cried Porthos, “if I were the esquire of poor	353.6064874241392
Chalais, should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me.”	314.5287034376261
“And you—you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the Red Duke,”	261.3814321538823
replied Aramis.	337.6872693944096
“Oh, the Red Duke! Bravo! Bravo! The Red Duke!” cried Porthos, clapping	304.11892603244087
his hands and nodding his head. “The Red Duke is capital. I’ll	185.06495576650727
circulate that saying, be assured, my dear fellow. Who says this Aramis	189.8579342478997
is not a wit? What a misfortune it is you did not follow your first	225.46660745415917
vocation; what a delicious abbé you would have made!”	322.0556655985665
“Oh, it’s only a temporary postponement,” replied Aramis; “I shall be	219.3977879161152
one someday. You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study	229.74721157874006
theology for that purpose.”	346.95172479520966
“He will be one, as he says,” cried Porthos; “he will be one, sooner or	182.43821191809295
later.”	351.11469531831733
“Sooner,” said Aramis.	320.49931368667734
“He only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock,	200.72916388953945
which hangs behind his uniform,” said another Musketeer.	253.91253414530826
“What is he waiting for?” asked another.	292.5787915344307
“Only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.”	222.91648368389158
“No jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,” said Porthos; “thank God the	194.6862485335878
queen is still of an age to give one!”	213.44573677665247
“They say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,” replied Aramis,	253.94879515969268
with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so	356.76834491145917
simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.	269.9952402280972
“Aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,” interrupted Porthos.	219.6068987571826
“Your wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if Monsieur de Tréville	297.4790420877615
heard you, you would repent of speaking thus.”	179.00154588287978
“Are you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?” cried Aramis, from whose	338.6797958118607
usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.	285.47567347725544
“My dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abbé. Be one or the other, but	219.4343502286559
not both,” replied Porthos. “You know what Athos told you the other	245.9755853263975
day; you eat at everybody’s mess. Ah, don’t be angry, I beg of you,	325.6747442954553
that would be useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, Athos	318.6981720400586
and me. You go to Madame d’Aguillon’s, and you pay your court to her;	272.36476392871964
you go to Madame de Bois-Tracy’s, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse,	256.05220890162786
and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady.	250.96807200296934
Oh, good Lord! Don’t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one	320.5110703323708
asks for your secret—all the world knows your discretion. But since you	186.9604094893757
possess that virtue, why the devil don’t you make use of it with	324.88642442169225
respect to her Majesty? Let whoever likes talk of the king and the	265.5839222688816
cardinal, and how he likes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone	306.7770139367716
speaks of her, let it be respectfully.”	175.87060465625942
“Porthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly tell you so,” replied	180.3246952453493
Aramis. “You know I hate moralizing, except when it is done by Athos.	256.74912162223865
As to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on	192.7022994851721
that head. I will be an abbé if it suits me. In the meanwhile I am a	239.35565243108005
Musketeer; in that quality I say what I please, and at this moment it	292.08528546484683
pleases me to say that you weary me.”	233.78520002815247
“Aramis!”	293.9751830495303
“Porthos!”	256.34847020896
“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” cried the surrounding group.	308.2240281083658
“Monsieur de Tréville awaits Monsieur d’Artagnan,” cried a servant,	287.11876508256466
throwing open the door of the cabinet.	263.08252566212053
At this announcement, during which the door remained open, everyone	254.41646677930814
became mute, and amid the general silence the young man crossed part of	260.67111683530004
the length of the antechamber, and entered the apartment of the captain	208.1374815058693
of the Musketeers, congratulating himself with all his heart at having	368.3881359229356
so narrowly escaped the end of this strange quarrel.	275.6576723108959
Chapter III.	256.67952840992433
THE AUDIENCE	338.10953640542846
M. de Tréville was at the moment in rather ill-humor, nevertheless he	360.26808213897766
saluted the young man politely, who bowed to the very ground; and he	249.31540169099856
smiled on receiving D’Artagnan’s response, the Béarnese accent of which	242.89216481435585
recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country—a double	282.0598454162953
remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward	293.1575791744468
the antechamber and making a sign to D’Artagnan with his hand, as if to	176.41569066302753
ask his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he	226.95200248868315
called three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran	269.9109877354054
through the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the	331.5158266727493
angry accent.	359.61250834371697
“Athos! Porthos! Aramis!”	177.92707916728673
The two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who	196.19529609031534
answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the	267.75441805222846
group of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet,	175.97299414328864
the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their	261.0771448213783
appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its	315.4071178461034
carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of	243.22631182326978
D’Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader	282.79786935580404
an Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders.	218.27730737263047
When the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind	263.7475384097796
them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons	231.03777726308607
which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had	264.89446889645853
recommenced; when M. de Tréville had three or four times paced in	298.1372710103115
silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet,	204.0544887057277
passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and	191.86120658868398
silent as if on parade—he stopped all at once full in front of them,	306.5368307694335
and covering them from head to foot with an angry look, “Do you know	237.61510852456803
what the king said to me,” cried he, “and that no longer ago than	225.59778070533042
yesterday evening—do you know, gentlemen?”	360.748225917466
“No,” replied the two Musketeers, after a moment’s silence, “no, sir,	261.9735023265343
we do not.”	177.13715084882546
“But I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us,” added Aramis, in	295.91968894281223
his politest tone and with his most graceful bow.	307.39971633676737
“He told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among	329.14745654396586
the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.”	334.4805251416816
“The Guards of the cardinal! And why so?” asked Porthos, warmly.	348.86696270580717
“Because he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of	255.66625655701415
being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.”	215.22772197676446
* A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape.	173.58540355353563
The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D’Artagnan did	275.0149987271082
not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground.	333.4330150070315
“Yes, yes,” continued M. de Tréville, growing warmer as he spoke, “and	314.97730517655964
his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the	273.8201383698691
Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related	317.2412499027315
yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very	202.14512749617455
displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those _damned	346.55060277917175
Musketeers_, those _daredevils_—he dwelt upon those words with an	238.4757244576807
ironical tone still more displeasing to me—those _braggarts_, added he,	199.02327119511966
glancing at me with his tiger-cat’s eye, had made a riot in the Rue	277.3618850148964
Férou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was	369.2117671030908
going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters!	315.32392693459997
_Morbleu!_ You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You	209.65739867554927
were among them—you were! Don’t deny it; you were recognized, and the	171.45366970191296
cardinal named you. But it’s all my fault; yes, it’s all my fault,	217.8638678388126
because it is myself who selects my men. You, Aramis, why the devil did	290.52943125582334
you ask me for a uniform when you would have been so much better in a	219.5433826618123
cassock? And you, Porthos, do you only wear such a fine golden baldric	287.7910725367784
to suspend a sword of straw from it? And Athos—I don’t see Athos. Where	196.67099635272413
is he?”	335.61088116710664
“Ill—”	306.7268096780824
“Very ill, say you? And of what malady?”	307.7531358107344
“It is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir,” replied Porthos,	307.8643241353924
desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; “and what is serious	193.2395050809193
is that it will certainly spoil his face.”	180.02148632200044
“The smallpox! That’s a great story to tell me, Porthos! Sick of the	357.9361836468497
smallpox at his age! No, no; but wounded without doubt, killed,	229.2244389062707
perhaps. Ah, if I knew! S’blood! Messieurs Musketeers, I will not have	211.07092446883374
this haunting of bad places, this quarreling in the streets, this	264.9954827442436
swordplay at the crossways; and above all, I will not have occasion	193.85735326495663
given for the cardinal’s Guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who	351.6136843359617
never put themselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides,	238.2411489101898
never allow themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! I am sure of	193.71800520175765
it—they would prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back	366.47992537523544
a step. To save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee—that is good for	235.2770010886095
the king’s Musketeers!”	217.4848021632642
Porthos and Aramis trembled with rage. They could willingly have	256.42879817099174
strangled M. de Tréville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not	338.02463005764673
felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. They	245.47527116293668
stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the	172.65320006917725
blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.	328.07903714547933
All without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis	225.33797597395377
called, and had guessed, from M. de Tréville’s tone of voice, that he	199.83100065483865
was very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued to the	357.2745516053676
tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to	218.51351761501599
the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths	350.61109651753407
repeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all	340.6486330274321
the people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the	319.43012384916835
cabinet to the street gate, the whole hôtel was boiling.	313.95568297894
“Ah! The king’s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal,	311.15528580377986
are they?” continued M. de Tréville, as furious at heart as his	364.36916412129244
soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so	174.55113258896483
to say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his	241.95291015838478
auditors. “What! Six of his Eminence’s Guards arrest six of his	311.6753673525558
Majesty’s Musketeers! _Morbleu!_ My part is taken! I will go straight	229.5612037931357
to the Louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king’s	368.07249328144763
Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal’s Guards, and if he	297.56780007132346
refuses me, _morbleu!_ I will turn abbé.”	306.94901431515825
At these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to	366.3218977421583
be heard but oaths and blasphemies. The _morbleus_, the _sang Dieus_,	182.34194137212936
the _morts touts les diables_, crossed one another in the air.	231.8272026025839
D’Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself,	335.3071588582468
and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table.	196.6775483131687
“Well, my Captain,” said Porthos, quite beside himself, “the truth is	331.83615787715985
that we were six against six. But we were not captured by fair means;	248.9095759203763
and before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,	293.64475231134395
and Athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. For you know	250.2712266271871
Athos. Well, Captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again	228.65546810256703
twice. And we did not surrender—no! They dragged us away by force. On	339.32319496415437
the way we escaped. As for Athos, they believed him to be dead, and	178.74724501343735
left him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the	214.54900916251194
trouble to carry him away. That’s the whole story. What the devil,	198.52314831942346
Captain, one cannot win all one’s battles! The great Pompey lost that	326.2198195424145
of Pharsalia; and Francis the First, who was, as I have heard say, as	209.60641475332082
good as other folks, nevertheless lost the Battle of Pavia.”	319.7066633456699
“And I have the honor of assuring you that I killed one of them with	263.70602525778605
his own sword,” said Aramis; “for mine was broken at the first parry.	193.77320251495985
Killed him, or poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you.”	353.3043904776906
“I did not know that,” replied M. de Tréville, in a somewhat softened	208.22132275868938
tone. “The cardinal exaggerated, as I perceive.”	197.3038730755528
“But pray, sir,” continued Aramis, who, seeing his captain become	252.63995503604508
appeased, ventured to risk a prayer, “do not say that Athos is wounded.	338.1224803240401
He would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and	238.67071113005608
as the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder	273.8827314751253
it penetrates into the chest, it is to be feared—”	294.4412916598236
At this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head,	302.6860364468378
but frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.	228.60650078388701
“Athos!” cried the two Musketeers.	321.9324058163533
“Athos!” repeated M. de Tréville himself.	239.82517857608778
“You have sent for me, sir,” said Athos to M. de Tréville, in a feeble	276.7490221341523
yet perfectly calm voice, “you have sent for me, as my comrades inform	276.10555429657296
me, and I have hastened to receive your orders. I am here; what do you	258.9824116562538
want with me?”	188.15890368645367
And at these words, the Musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as	279.83478654630034
usual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. M. de Tréville,	178.31764963255776
moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang	230.70922744020547
toward him.	248.75446244647767
“I was about to say to these gentlemen,” added he, “that I forbid my	251.2388476610989
Musketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very	337.3988542537596
dear to the king, and the king knows that his Musketeers are the	172.0208475153529
bravest on the earth. Your hand, Athos!”	240.03209899568253
And without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of	243.20270867479164
affection, M. de Tréville seized his right hand and pressed it with all	252.48483342038
his might, without perceiving that Athos, whatever might be his	368.78894110860494
self-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if	307.219534226154
possible, grew paler than he was before.	274.3359321376654
The door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by	222.73911139655706
the arrival of Athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known	227.48163578968163
to all. A burst of satisfaction hailed the last words of the captain;	313.09393290608443
and two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,	192.3652751332438
appeared through the openings of the tapestry. M. de Tréville was about	261.8087301390293
to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the	296.4181898083552
hand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against	286.9755119607295
pain, at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.	343.81892298208686
“A surgeon!” cried M. de Tréville, “mine! The king’s! The best! A	186.28870919554808
surgeon! Or, s’blood, my brave Athos will die!”	349.22172141994486
At the cries of M. de Tréville, the whole assemblage rushed into the	224.67921573055642
cabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all	256.0276822091878
crowded round the wounded man. But all this eager attention might have	345.6386524564353
been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be	254.49027889611548
in the hôtel. He pushed through the crowd, approached Athos, still	330.0579685524537
insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him	370.1904222549206
greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the	353.9645122007147
Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M.	291.00345028769226
de Tréville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore	287.00222107547427
their comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and	193.9072754531443
behind the surgeon the door closed.	338.1638925432127
The cabinet of M. de Tréville, generally held so sacred, became in an	365.4942200711854
instant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and	292.8530430529722
vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his	242.5590123248087
Guards to all the devils.	362.55675982265706
An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de	215.45868252712154
Tréville alone remaining with the wounded.	350.5750407327524
At length, M. de Tréville himself returned. The injured man had	276.5454605148367
recovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the	264.54892983135437
Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness	194.68709461986435
having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood.	326.19874079695813
Then M. de Tréville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except	252.29886389083464
D’Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the	192.2349109425944
tenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.	201.23931169722476
When all had gone out and the door was closed, M. de Tréville, on	313.8210063367737
turning round, found himself alone with the young man. The event which	283.08157529358266
had occurred had in some degree broken the thread of his ideas. He	257.86660953288657
inquired what was the will of his persevering visitor. D’Artagnan then	174.34609609637496
repeated his name, and in an instant recovering all his remembrances of	306.7993447945433
the present and the past, M. de Tréville grasped the situation.	177.8973748329329
“Pardon me,” said he, smiling, “pardon me my dear compatriot, but I had	267.75911290526966
wholly forgotten you. But what help is there for it! A captain is	224.68203066374474
nothing but a father of a family, charged with even a greater	304.34049867733296
responsibility than the father of an ordinary family. Soldiers are big	336.46233013216704
children; but as I maintain that the orders of the king, and more	349.9378047382823
particularly the orders of the cardinal, should be executed—”	226.7265281588251
D’Artagnan could not restrain a smile. By this smile M. de Tréville	239.58931342295563
judged that he had not to deal with a fool, and changing the	362.55595156803525
conversation, came straight to the point.	272.3563461105622
“I respected your father very much,” said he. “What can I do for the	368.63464132885065
son? Tell me quickly; my time is not my own.”	280.21210711923976
“Monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, “on quitting Tarbes and coming hither, it	361.85900015986056
was my intention to request of you, in remembrance of the friendship	335.5135030637108
which you have not forgotten, the uniform of a Musketeer; but after all	301.8238114280396
that I have seen during the last two hours, I comprehend that such a	299.56428815125344
favor is enormous, and tremble lest I should not merit it.”	334.0224231466643
“It is indeed a favor, young man,” replied M. de Tréville, “but it may	203.57756681225385
not be so far beyond your hopes as you believe, or rather as you appear	360.8532534320169
to believe. But his majesty’s decision is always necessary; and I	257.57457826314743
inform you with regret that no one becomes a Musketeer without the	292.30156071799854
preliminary ordeal of several campaigns, certain brilliant actions, or	204.58470540280484
a service of two years in some other regiment less favored than ours.”	340.8459357606422
D’Artagnan bowed without replying, feeling his desire to don the	176.6333037039603
Musketeer’s uniform vastly increased by the great difficulties which	239.79525724227938
preceded the attainment of it.	364.7822362264471
“But,” continued M. de Tréville, fixing upon his compatriot a look so	192.6372055829145
piercing that it might be said he wished to read the thoughts of his	178.58929356921675
heart, “on account of my old companion, your father, as I have said, I	254.92255076904252
will do something for you, young man. Our recruits from Béarn are not	177.5223895032967
generally very rich, and I have no reason to think matters have much	259.6488780116673
changed in this respect since I left the province. I dare say you have	238.98970977003086
not brought too large a stock of money with you?”	171.45506055090394
D’Artagnan drew himself up with a proud air which plainly said, “I ask	325.193241170565
alms of no man.”	328.1003397753608
“Oh, that’s very well, young man,” continued M. de Tréville, “that’s	353.6140769303163
all very well. I know these airs; I myself came to Paris with four	327.0396299050117
crowns in my purse, and would have fought with anyone who dared to tell	256.26536074406124
me I was not in a condition to purchase the Louvre.”	328.96273850474006
D’Artagnan’s bearing became still more imposing. Thanks to the sale of	285.3941340530987
his horse, he commenced his career with four more crowns than M. de	301.7379140461047
Tréville possessed at the commencement of his.	198.6809511025494
“You ought, I say, then, to husband the means you have, however large	214.86425608019127
the sum may be; but you ought also to endeavor to perfect yourself in	317.170525982903
the exercises becoming a gentleman. I will write a letter today to the	198.30794680305425
Director of the Royal Academy, and tomorrow he will admit you without	205.95925244164866
any expense to yourself. Do not refuse this little service. Our	207.22644661884425
best-born and richest gentlemen sometimes solicit it without being able	285.6544856381176
to obtain it. You will learn horsemanship, swordsmanship in all its	330.3277163837763
branches, and dancing. You will make some desirable acquaintances; and	299.09971082983907
from time to time you can call upon me, just to tell me how you are	214.54481082973365
getting on, and to say whether I can be of further service to you.”	208.11151946548034
D’Artagnan, stranger as he was to all the manners of a court, could not	267.4310019872102
but perceive a little coldness in this reception.	309.6644888469146
“Alas, sir,” said he, “I cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the	311.17064719192166
letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.”	260.6101881121996
“I certainly am surprised,” replied M. de Tréville, “that you should	239.94524824107498
undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole	336.97017456667317
resource of us poor Béarnese.”	363.80903555698853
“I had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,” cried	221.11903563569567
D’Artagnan; “but it was perfidiously stolen from me.”	311.45911260490186
He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman	349.6275326969766
with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness	219.80716584039834
that delighted M. de Tréville.	225.66463071856393
“This is all very strange,” said M. de Tréville, after meditating a	271.01854912066443
minute; “you mentioned my name, then, aloud?”	356.0449763196032
“Yes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have	209.41683843669247
done otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.	224.2141880964295
Judge if I should not put myself under its protection.”	215.78924924609134
Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Tréville loved	275.1396007716611
incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain	370.7457292387478
from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared,	244.57045431466105
and returning to the adventure of Meung, “Tell me,” continued he, “had	275.4804731695684
not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?”	184.75323926516558
“Yes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.”	367.05305000804105
“Was he not a fine-looking man?”	254.988375107485
“Yes.”	298.23830730295305
“Of lofty stature.”	362.2690231351594
“Yes.”	317.78574559996446
“Of pale complexion and brown hair?”	200.0033682604357
“Yes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with	226.59200747409707
this man? If I ever find him again—and I will find him, I swear, were	250.4802124196945
it in hell!”	282.86008364492955
“He was waiting for a woman,” continued Tréville.	263.20255244734506
“He departed immediately after having conversed for a minute with her	225.2911029966745
whom he awaited.”	315.6450392190172
“You know not the subject of their conversation?”	181.25902130561883
“He gave her a box, told her not to open it except in London.”	192.3602470651451
“Was this woman English?”	265.55142698605005
“He called her Milady.”	250.8707026724859
“It is he; it must be he!” murmured Tréville. “I believed him still at	230.477304142205
Brussels.”	253.0454393328376
“Oh, sir, if you know who this man is,” cried D’Artagnan, “tell me who	268.76689966626134
he is, and whence he is. I will then release you from all your	232.83816396700735
promises—even that of procuring my admission into the Musketeers; for	349.07496830186085
before everything, I wish to avenge myself.”	247.33962742210855
“Beware, young man!” cried Tréville. “If you see him coming on one side	173.41989218119204
of the street, pass by on the other. Do not cast yourself against such	264.85962746229643
a rock; he would break you like glass.”	264.29464478097816
“That will not prevent me,” replied D’Artagnan, “if ever I find him.”	266.36842317120977
“In the meantime,” said Tréville, “seek him not—if I have a right to	183.23650429845847
advise you.”	263.9058679791449
All at once the captain stopped, as if struck by a sudden suspicion.	259.79998473595504
This great hatred which the young traveler manifested so loudly for	326.8877054346782
this man, who—a rather improbable thing—had stolen his father’s letter	280.06420406925173
from him—was there not some perfidy concealed under this hatred? Might	256.6540118518372
not this young man be sent by his Eminence? Might he not have come for	364.8824526437626
the purpose of laying a snare for him? This pretended D’Artagnan—was he	332.25142133738944
not an emissary of the cardinal, whom the cardinal sought to introduce	335.6133517596037
into Tréville’s house, to place near him, to win his confidence, and	338.2455757484155
afterward to ruin him as had been done in a thousand other instances?	191.8745513427689
He fixed his eyes upon D’Artagnan even more earnestly than before. He	322.2497939313545
was moderately reassured, however, by the aspect of that countenance,	336.723287611106
full of astute intelligence and affected humility. “I know he is a	176.86173569702052
Gascon,” reflected he, “but he may be one for the cardinal as well as	244.4596411493671
for me. Let us try him.”	305.4067864030804
“My friend,” said he, slowly, “I wish, as the son of an ancient	301.9805129138548
friend—for I consider this story of the lost letter perfectly true—I	334.57701265737313
wish, I say, in order to repair the coldness you may have remarked in	301.44798922906415
my reception of you, to discover to you the secrets of our policy. The	254.529940236169
king and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent	178.67569399573517
bickerings are only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a	295.9881571591985
compatriot, a handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his	219.25673374677507
way, should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the	273.5310355797873
snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it.	220.43754703911657
Be assured that I am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and	235.35493635930982
that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the	209.02306367595205
king, and also the cardinal—one of the most illustrious geniuses that	229.05736233738492
France has ever produced.	267.87877436578543
“Now, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you	186.98375379801791
entertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your	275.5629960310366
instincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out	246.70732355993823
against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you	280.69195801975815
in many ways, but without attaching you to my person. I hope that my	285.2830067685578
frankness at least will make you my friend; for you are the only young	363.5089952434864
man to whom I have hitherto spoken as I have done to you.”	188.0710884514649
Tréville said to himself: “If the cardinal has set this young fox upon	226.34491997602447
me, he will certainly not have failed—he, who knows how bitterly I	214.79537490869336
execrate him—to tell his spy that the best means of making his court to	330.5489593065995
me is to rail at him. Therefore, in spite of all my protestations, if	320.26668528707546
it be as I suspect, my cunning gossip will assure me that he holds his	225.55376389277944
Eminence in horror.”	213.67426443724688
It, however, proved otherwise. D’Artagnan answered, with the greatest	295.749029024241
simplicity: “I came to Paris with exactly such intentions. My father	351.6253732374067
advised me to stoop to nobody but the king, the cardinal, and	213.8746865758536
yourself—whom he considered the first three personages in France.”	359.1796757388909
D’Artagnan added M. de Tréville to the others, as may be perceived; but	309.5827554278882
he thought this addition would do no harm.	185.54150354156405
“I have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,” continued he, “and	320.9488720875093
the most profound respect for his actions. So much the better for me,	198.9131699993856
sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness—for then you will	199.74970468781132
do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you	240.30724398589152
have entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am	315.0210716317052
ruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still trust you will not	293.14548567702775
esteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.”	171.66760778609583
M. de Tréville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much	202.1378887212822
penetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not	253.12616971669848
entirely remove his suspicions. The more this young man was superior to	202.60141889095428
others, the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him.	235.22701650459845
Nevertheless, he pressed D’Artagnan’s hand, and said to him: “You are	256.2944522081797
an honest youth; but at the present moment I can only do for you that	263.5025756106639
which I just now offered. My hôtel will be always open to you.	271.0095785685963
Hereafter, being able to ask for me at all hours, and consequently to	305.54213020768094
take advantage of all opportunities, you will probably obtain that	277.02969321080246
which you desire.”	306.9319589140774
“That is to say,” replied D’Artagnan, “that you will wait until I have	229.9275105487446
proved myself worthy of it. Well, be assured,” added he, with the	273.5271490763813
familiarity of a Gascon, “you shall not wait long.” And he bowed in	357.61487200946056
order to retire, and as if he considered the future in his own hands.	222.1704353774324
“But wait a minute,” said M. de Tréville, stopping him. “I promised you	284.6338889817772
a letter for the director of the Academy. Are you too proud to accept	360.391405780187
it, young gentleman?”	343.6573457377305
“No, sir,” said D’Artagnan; “and I will guard it so carefully that I	224.8235342526492
will be sworn it shall arrive at its address, and woe be to him who	201.33437817796386
shall attempt to take it from me!”	310.021095268826
M. de Tréville smiled at this flourish; and leaving his young man	174.01282821156377
compatriot in the embrasure of the window, where they had talked	235.55744303184505
together, he seated himself at a table in order to write the promised	232.83600516122215
letter of recommendation. While he was doing this, D’Artagnan, having	186.69480181405396
no better employment, amused himself with beating a march upon the	234.4645322829146
window and with looking at the Musketeers, who went away, one after	188.84438114877608
another, following them with his eyes until they disappeared.	354.3003180342679
M. de Tréville, after having written the letter, sealed it, and rising,	187.59304775550174
approached the young man in order to give it to him. But at the very	184.39249249648157
moment when D’Artagnan stretched out his hand to receive it, M. de	350.6081183880952
Tréville was highly astonished to see his _protégé_ make a sudden	362.76229730386655
spring, become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying,	241.06596738598301
“S’blood, he shall not escape me this time!”	232.2135831432479
“And who?” asked M. de Tréville.	234.97887161514507
“He, my thief!” replied D’Artagnan. “Ah, the traitor!” and he	360.3840404257702
disappeared.	354.6428024233666
“The devil take the madman!” murmured M. de Tréville, “unless,” added	363.9093285005049
he, “this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in	223.87539131647415
his purpose!”	222.90581852113388
Chapter IV.	238.29035671535144
THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS, THE BALDRIC OF PORTHOS AND THE HANDKERCHIEF OF	321.383880939836
ARAMIS	285.8272772510218
D’Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three	234.25408307308672
bounds, and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon	368.25642003013024
descending four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head	278.08069253160375
foremost against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. de	338.57985251558995
Tréville’s private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him	207.0982605188353
utter a cry, or rather a howl.	275.30359823496747
“Excuse me,” said D’Artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, “excuse	249.715130743195
me, but I am in a hurry.”	173.64742221272326
Scarcely had he descended the first stair, when a hand of iron seized	194.290559007692
him by the belt and stopped him.	175.73850602275127
“You are in a hurry?” said the Musketeer, as pale as a sheet. “Under	181.9716012542507
that pretense you run against me! You say, ‘Excuse me,’ and you believe	277.38112481505397
that is sufficient? Not at all, my young man. Do you fancy because you	355.4024949196433
have heard Monsieur de Tréville speak to us a little cavalierly today	243.5098780689425
that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? Undeceive	264.98096865224664
yourself, comrade, you are not Monsieur de Tréville.”	301.4447119441759
“My faith!” replied D’Artagnan, recognizing Athos, who, after the	189.68194077377657
dressing performed by the doctor, was returning to his own apartment.	282.7029353173521
“I did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, I said	240.55832337906602
‘Excuse me.’ It appears to me that this is quite enough. I repeat to	329.96305719761676
you, however, and this time on my word of honor—I think perhaps too	299.16798732732093
often—that I am in haste, great haste. Leave your hold, then, I beg of	303.94339551697874
you, and let me go where my business calls me.”	183.20360263023068
“Monsieur,” said Athos, letting him go, “you are not polite; it is easy	242.28477878040508
to perceive that you come from a distance.”	257.36185785909333
D’Artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at Athos’s	182.27771474266436
last remark he stopped short.	239.69991479670824
“_Morbleu_, monsieur!” said he, “however far I may come, it is not you	330.4431550689007
who can give me a lesson in good manners, I warn you.”	230.61750223608828
“Perhaps,” said Athos.	180.58944228009372
“Ah! If I were not in such haste, and if I were not running after	293.5786665850785
someone,” said D’Artagnan.	309.0682002202653
“Monsieur Man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running—_me_, you	266.40818520081945
understand?”	184.09212110885022
“And where, I pray you?”	369.1149933104691
“Near the Carmes-Deschaux.”	228.85054574606255
“At what hour?”	312.4710237505687
“About noon.”	174.88385872712922
“About noon? That will do; I will be there.”	365.63795295940974
“Endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve I will cut	319.82842881314815
off your ears as you run.”	327.60569706393744
“Good!” cried D’Artagnan, “I will be there ten minutes before twelve.”	193.93423289896657
And he set off running as if the devil possessed him, hoping that he	278.5167748132802
might yet find the stranger, whose slow pace could not have carried him	332.47214073758255
far.	353.8460632853901
But at the street gate, Porthos was talking with the soldier on guard.	315.2106046588648
Between the two talkers there was just enough room for a man to pass.	254.79431659964018
D’Artagnan thought it would suffice for him, and he sprang forward like	326.9653417752488
a dart between them. But D’Artagnan had reckoned without the wind. As	345.6335173251209
he was about to pass, the wind blew out Porthos’s long cloak, and	216.5222019688788
D’Artagnan rushed straight into the middle of it. Without doubt,	182.29602361925123
Porthos had reasons for not abandoning this part of his vestments, for	199.09604674274738
instead of quitting his hold on the flap in his hand, he pulled it	200.07327496701635
toward him, so that D’Artagnan rolled himself up in the velvet by a	217.3649716489283
movement of rotation explained by the persistency of Porthos.	212.43547512105766
D’Artagnan, hearing the Musketeer swear, wished to escape from the	216.56537266305293
cloak, which blinded him, and sought to find his way from under the	187.3955325218126
folds of it. He was particularly anxious to avoid marring the freshness	286.11938331086947
of the magnificent baldric we are acquainted with; but on timidly	260.1976694976928
opening his eyes, he found himself with his nose fixed between the two	309.5214438869888
shoulders of Porthos—that is to say, exactly upon the baldric.	207.88840641453487
Alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor	249.34675895196239
but appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but	337.19537307381194
was nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious as he was, Porthos	340.9472021016802
could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least	365.82816538468023
half. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of	238.110633011515
the cloak.	238.15404517081987
“Bless me!” cried Porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass	276.1534578019598
himself of D’Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; “you must be	346.435220440967
mad to run against people in this manner.”	190.94999869199344
“Excuse me,” said D’Artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the	355.3812822927445
giant, “but I am in such haste—I was running after someone and—”	185.93240487938118
“And do you always forget your eyes when you run?” asked Porthos.	316.09477644021183
“No,” replied D’Artagnan, piqued, “and thanks to my eyes, I can see	345.1274470511536
what other people cannot see.”	183.67075406855741
Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to	358.77924799478205
his anger, “Monsieur,” said he, “you stand a chance of getting	241.22780738560846
chastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion.”	257.63434405567284
“Chastised, Monsieur!” said D’Artagnan, “the expression is strong.”	367.39072916329167
“It is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the	201.75324541681218
face.”	257.6106227342581
“Ah, _pardieu!_ I know full well that you don’t turn your back to	285.170676780686
yours.”	355.8444567879454
And the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly.	341.06776643364185
Porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after D’Artagnan.	286.3700841365368
“Presently, presently,” cried the latter, “when you haven’t your cloak	290.9921592472909
on.”	217.23426457401993
“At one o’clock, then, behind the Luxembourg.”	200.1124139282684
“Very well, at one o’clock, then,” replied D’Artagnan, turning the	204.2748924307728
angle of the street.	192.7764578302557
But neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which	224.45893970600127
his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the	357.89017699353667
stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered	225.28245395216925
some house. D’Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to	184.24103070568742
the ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but	186.7636019958136
nothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, advantageous to	235.51207410654865
him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his	218.32046845689692
forehead, his heart began to cool.	338.31239699994865
He began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous	336.9408701279385
and inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven o’clock in the morning, and	287.940791425232
yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de	321.00311103899986
Tréville, who could not fail to think the manner in which D’Artagnan	236.72546024297947
had left him a little cavalier.	305.9505453962555
Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,	274.94554463804184
each capable of killing three D’Artagnans—with two Musketeers, in	186.03547221480588
short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he	339.8421898729657
placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.	309.45641875260526
The outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be	250.45300917951738
understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As	277.8181840773087
hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he	321.1473750997817
finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible	250.76517850757068
wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the	307.12450063116773
following reprehensions upon his own conduct:	352.1910615969517
“What a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am! That brave and	198.686376620953
unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I	331.21540415623383
must run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me	357.6555745494941
is that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so;	370.9671511872567
the pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos—oh, as to	314.33011755194394
Porthos, faith, that’s a droll affair!”	242.84007067247876
And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking	287.1183446472378
round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a	231.64062576632364
cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one.	198.1538069543511
“As to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy	259.6815453409564
fool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any	270.36492141093413
right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He	356.455989853482
would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had	180.47935415037963
not said anything to him about that cursed baldric—in ambiguous words,	226.68300747703813
it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I	221.2596665140005
get from one hobble into another. Friend D’Artagnan,” continued he,	364.6219912970788
speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself,	294.6553489466139
“if you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you	346.863902500133
to practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be	270.8038354476554
admired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not	313.2813042858754
necessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is	247.70245748958098
mildness and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling	359.06139802545914
Aramis a coward? No, certainly not, and from this moment I will	302.0670803466613
endeavor to model myself after him. Ah! That’s strange! Here he is!”	232.05760803849614
D’Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps	306.40046072439975
of the hôtel d’Arguillon and in front of that hôtel perceived Aramis,	223.22600289916676
chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that	357.226441899585
it was in presence of this young man that M. de Tréville had been so	232.28322023954917
angry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had	193.2806745281353
received was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see	267.8559194648805
him. D’Artagnan, on the contrary, quite full of his plans of	195.91963891163033
conciliation and courtesy, approached the young men with a profound	175.3616780092642
bow, accompanied by a most gracious smile. All four, besides,	204.64362566124754
immediately broke off their conversation.	312.1972130873153
D’Artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many;	244.99371300623858
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world	233.07051898555972
to know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like	235.17946440911237
that of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely	330.8189870837506
acquainted with and in a conversation that does not concern him. He was	235.6534363359122
seeking in his mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when	210.47837115866554
he remarked that Aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake,	246.2240752192683
no doubt, had placed his foot upon it. This appeared to be a favorable	344.90924987320795
opportunity to repair his intrusion. He stooped, and with the most	298.6288606663237
gracious air he could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot	218.02604302873578
of the Musketeer in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it,	366.16130700598615
and holding it out to him, said, “I believe, monsieur, that this is a	189.24261073598305
handkerchief you would be sorry to lose?”	367.04017087528155
The handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a coronet and	337.8801290256505
arms at one of its corners. Aramis blushed excessively, and snatched	302.0405326452309
rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the Gascon.	205.83826046736715
“Ah, ah!” cried one of the Guards, “will you persist in saying, most	314.1692101246099
discreet Aramis, that you are not on good terms with Madame de	244.90648875107726
Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of	367.4946765077401
her handkerchiefs?”	257.4634448942381
Aramis darted at D’Artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that	267.47069654362434
he has acquired a mortal enemy. Then, resuming his mild air, “You are	369.1853110693178
deceived, gentlemen,” said he, “this handkerchief is not mine, and I	286.65233687000125
cannot fancy why Monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me	236.45837439777475
rather than to one of you; and as a proof of what I say, here is mine	345.5330292083322
in my pocket.”	344.3197619627808
So saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant	185.11654703805812
handkerchief, and of fine cambric—though cambric was dear at the	228.78551880319895
period—but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only	278.22069540499035
ornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.	328.7924783005105
This time D’Artagnan was not hasty. He perceived his mistake; but the	239.98721219802002
friends of Aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of	360.6388632850395
them addressed the young Musketeer with affected seriousness. “If it	341.22482145868827
were as you pretend it is,” said he, “I should be forced, my dear	268.9644962294547
Aramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is	343.72792398412616
an intimate friend of mine, and I cannot allow the property of his wife	307.1497185585147
to be sported as a trophy.”	241.52649237742278
“You make the demand badly,” replied Aramis; “and while acknowledging	351.51655414026624
the justice of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of the form.”	338.08590690635106
“The fact is,” hazarded D’Artagnan, timidly, “I did not see the	207.3719133277806
handkerchief fall from the pocket of Monsieur Aramis. He had his foot	309.40847954148023
upon it, that is all; and I thought from having his foot upon it the	280.1225438466915
handkerchief was his.”	280.3209470315518
“And you were deceived, my dear sir,” replied Aramis, coldly, very	317.1569364580285
little sensible to the reparation. Then turning toward that one of the	297.82420882161625
guards who had declared himself the friend of Bois-Tracy, “Besides,”	195.09417547949772
continued he, “I have reflected, my dear intimate of Bois-Tracy, that I	214.10177508644165
am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that	257.38462335009956
decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your	310.1931777490947
pocket as mine.”	225.39556390462903
“No, upon my honor!” cried his Majesty’s Guardsman.	220.425317082827
“You are about to swear upon your honor and I upon my word, and then it	181.1140588494472
will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied. Now, here,	301.6555876750774
Montaran, we will do better than that—let each take a half.”	283.28921359673404
“Of the handkerchief?”	312.48907089447
“Yes.”	337.17711966741604
“Perfectly just,” cried the other two Guardsmen, “the judgment of King	254.3666153011299
Solomon! Aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!”	230.74863481916958
The young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair	184.6729597859601
had no other sequel. In a moment or two the conversation ceased, and	214.63265308084164
the three Guardsmen and the Musketeer, after having cordially shaken	295.78631718040197
hands, separated, the Guardsmen going one way and Aramis another.	214.34331680287954
“Now is my time to make peace with this gallant man,” said D’Artagnan	245.81158247377152
to himself, having stood on one side during the whole of the latter	310.7128958458326
part of the conversation; and with this good feeling drawing near to	351.54271460426924
Aramis, who was departing without paying any attention to him,	181.86134402783497
“Monsieur,” said he, “you will excuse me, I hope.”	172.66796835199753
“Ah, monsieur,” interrupted Aramis, “permit me to observe to you that	240.96603780970082
you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought.”	283.96455294761887
“What, monsieur!” cried D’Artagnan, “and do you suppose—”	315.5837095119047
“I suppose, monsieur, that you are not a fool, and that you knew very	329.02225505612813
well, although coming from Gascony, that people do not tread upon	274.3067432422526
handkerchiefs without a reason. What the devil! Paris is not paved with	267.8262310832665
cambric!”	355.85459696970884
“Monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me,” said	236.91469699455
D’Artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began to speak more	354.03149951265823
loudly than his pacific resolutions. “I am from Gascony, it is true;	234.8293881410598
and since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that Gascons	361.8680661659326
are not very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once,	204.4751657418916
were it even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done	288.5623507212299
already at least as much again as they ought to have done.”	266.9098575404295
“Monsieur, what I say to you about the matter,” said Aramis, “is not	254.4901563348951
for the sake of seeking a quarrel. Thank God, I am not a bravo! And	306.4162118100836
being a Musketeer but for a time, I only fight when I am forced to do	365.2884458203796
so, and always with great repugnance; but this time the affair is	245.91093808021418
serious, for here is a lady compromised by you.”	328.94247896963736
“By _us_, you mean!” cried D’Artagnan.	204.4922035866948
“Why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?”	300.4489297436004
“Why did you so awkwardly let it fall?”	348.09732172787096
“I have said, monsieur, and I repeat, that the handkerchief did not	212.15423194586825
fall from my pocket.”	305.2433698167862
“And thereby you have lied twice, monsieur, for I saw it fall.”	271.70385939771523
“Ah, you take it with that tone, do you, Master Gascon? Well, I will	220.62435151031912
teach you how to behave yourself.”	217.42509783370866
“And I will send you back to your Mass book, Master Abbé. Draw, if you	343.2711247215571
please, and instantly—”	207.213637656684
“Not so, if you please, my good friend—not here, at least. Do you not	364.75027855015776
perceive that we are opposite the Hôtel d’Arguillon, which is full of	197.4915644867923
the cardinal’s creatures? How do I know that this is not his Eminence	289.7087346914814
who has honored you with the commission to procure my head? Now, I	272.98591981985794
entertain a ridiculous partiality for my head, it seems to suit my	344.8082028065135
shoulders so correctly. I wish to kill you, be at rest as to that, but	354.7156742387565
to kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where you will not be able	228.8308004863399
to boast of your death to anybody.”	330.7512342094448
“I agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident. Take your	360.97655212235264
handkerchief; whether it belongs to you or another, you may perhaps	347.5410661255915
stand in need of it.”	295.90335212731867
“Monsieur is a Gascon?” asked Aramis.	330.980250744429
“Yes. Monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?”	326.7562604054246
“Prudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently useless to Musketeers, I	300.7207220205686
know, but indispensable to churchmen; and as I am only a Musketeer	190.99645011128104
provisionally, I hold it good to be prudent. At two o’clock I shall	222.61285893771276
have the honor of expecting you at the hôtel of Monsieur de Tréville.	241.28414860368682
There I will indicate to you the best place and time.”	280.7064044553723
The two young men bowed and separated, Aramis ascending the street	187.57867693292405
which led to the Luxembourg, while D’Artagnan, perceiving the appointed	229.8985629796489
hour was approaching, took the road to the Carmes-Deschaux, saying to	297.9972386964775
himself, “Decidedly I can’t draw back; but at least, if I am killed, I	223.34523378484022
shall be killed by a Musketeer.”	315.80202308723847
Chapter V.	292.50995219770687
THE KING’S MUSKETEERS AND THE CARDINAL’S GUARDS	176.65202290105861
D’Artagnan was acquainted with nobody in Paris. He went therefore to	236.852404028382
his appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied	226.76665553171887
with those his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was	200.00664926739773
formed to make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without	211.4619019299226
meanness or weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which	316.20638542645133
generally results from an affair of this kind, when a young and	227.45164845113837
vigorous man fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened—if	347.1442359710227
conquered, he doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he	326.8426792207878
is accused of foul play and want of courage.	201.76006826515416
Now, we must have badly painted the character of our adventure seeker,	212.0725915309797
or our readers must have already perceived that D’Artagnan was not an	315.97281305312555
ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was	206.42890599815766
inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less	362.7172848989027
courageous and less restrained might have done in his place. He	198.7492724494349
reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going	242.17956436137263
to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. He hoped, by	204.976706850599
means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of Athos, whose lordly air and	186.23182605115343
austere bearing pleased him much. He flattered himself he should be	343.6689424158945
able to frighten Porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he	265.2702294240921
might, if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital	240.53286245444235
which, well managed, would cover Porthos with ridicule. As to the	298.1662947438493
astute Aramis, he did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he	324.65150531399786
should be able to get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good	177.97036280181317
style or at least, by hitting him in the face, as Cæsar recommended his	319.9192455455071
soldiers do to those of Pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which	180.40348140609348
he was so proud.	312.44189882081434
In addition to this, D’Artagnan possessed that invincible stock of	253.35318081915045
resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart:	369.25692614872816
“Endure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and Monsieur de	229.22367743816528
Tréville.” He flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the	304.2616321124783
Carmes Déchaussés, or rather Deschaux, as it was called at that period,	176.61839889232596
a sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields—an	204.24274010091798
accessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the	369.071270367617
place for the duels of men who had no time to lose.	310.66410925642083
When D’Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which	223.1490604649626
extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about	240.99452228267654
five minutes, and twelve o’clock was striking. He was, then, as	325.1585447078403
punctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with	254.5118381037696
regard to duels could have nothing to say.	229.6782169563322
Athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been	211.25244473580176
dressed anew by M. de Tréville’s surgeon, was seated on a post and	256.3625865971121
waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching	257.04473271337895
the ground.	332.8298713495961
“Monsieur,” said Athos, “I have engaged two of my friends as seconds;	205.18660189347762
but these two friends are not yet come, at which I am astonished, as it	201.07899823895238
is not at all their custom.”	232.23658761829248
“I have no seconds on my part, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan; “for having	339.1267600128001
only arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but Monsieur de	194.22399100382134
Tréville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who has the honor to	354.8091701026485
be, in some degree, one of his friends.”	178.13857208308596
Athos reflected for an instant. “You know no one but Monsieur de	185.97475705862362
Tréville?” he asked.	213.28069207684862
“Yes, monsieur, I know only him.”	335.0289646464006
“Well, but then,” continued Athos, speaking half to himself, “if I kill	345.79443977302844
you, I shall have the air of a boy-slayer.”	341.45269495755383
“Not too much so,” replied D’Artagnan, with a bow that was not	171.34249968321043
deficient in dignity, “since you do me the honor to draw a sword with	271.48429938304184
me while suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient.”	223.90113733043765
“Very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, I can	315.66194441955895
tell you. But I will take the left hand—it is my custom in such	272.4086229117561
circumstances. Do not fancy that I do you a favor; I use either hand	232.92110737109772
easily. And it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is	237.94361839594887
very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it. I regret I did	254.79241325546235
not inform you sooner of this circumstance.”	185.06946743018293
“You have truly, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing again, “a courtesy,	366.99337001660047
for which, I assure you, I am very grateful.”	354.2415267491548
“You confuse me,” replied Athos, with his gentlemanly air; “let us talk	296.4051034045091
of something else, if you please. Ah, s’blood, how you have hurt me! My	213.1342229340188
shoulder quite burns.”	324.2589733367312
“If you would permit me—” said D’Artagnan, with timidity.	267.3517753655676
“What, monsieur?”	337.9509189465533
“I have a miraculous balsam for wounds—a balsam given to me by my	304.1343854791153
mother and of which I have made a trial upon myself.”	314.52739074688554
“Well?”	218.81789646357373
“Well, I am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure	310.22215705437867
you; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured—well, sir,	294.47546020546923
it would still do me a great honor to be your man.”	353.6577995976314
D’Artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his	207.24528384462144
courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.	291.38110874734855
“_Pardieu_, monsieur!” said Athos, “that’s a proposition that pleases	350.6668721601769
me; not that I can accept it, but a league off it savors of the	252.60531956148333
gentleman. Thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of	296.6152096290367
Charlemagne, in whom every cavalier ought to seek his model.	311.68129642229854
Unfortunately, we do not live in the times of the great emperor, we	255.9200997570789
live in the times of the cardinal; and three days hence, however well	184.3218945037703
the secret might be guarded, it would be known, I say, that we were to	272.1218765611374
fight, and our combat would be prevented. I think these fellows will	272.6039205138919
never come.”	175.1133896405142
“If you are in haste, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, with the same	184.4229679022994
simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off	192.70758580168402
the duel for three days, “and if it be your will to dispatch me at	261.1171223272029
once, do not inconvenience yourself, I pray you.”	331.4386603678755
“There is another word which pleases me,” cried Athos, with a gracious	336.50208318713914
nod to D’Artagnan. “That did not come from a man without a heart.	302.63477265408505
Monsieur, I love men of your kidney; and I foresee plainly that if we	363.2031643930712
don’t kill each other, I shall hereafter have much pleasure in your	323.92583204290884
conversation. We will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; I have	214.27569902469935
plenty of time, and it will be more correct. Ah, here is one of them, I	274.02059479222385
believe.”	304.82677859638227
In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared.	239.66024777586807
“What!” cried D’Artagnan, “is your first witness Monsieur Porthos?”	326.3434995699855
“Yes, that disturbs you?”	271.4024892728522
“By no means.”	236.81961848242418
“And here is the second.”	333.03754348506766
D’Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived	227.1381617249851
Aramis.	369.8288053981855
“What!” cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,	230.14152897931655
“your second witness is Monsieur Aramis?”	342.0900978511345
“Doubtless! Are you not aware that we are never seen one without the	190.03579884490577
others, and that we are called among the Musketeers and the Guards, at	364.24883915607734
court and in the city, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, or the Three	185.02444371943054
Inseparables? And yet, as you come from Dax or Pau—”	324.16871178370366
“From Tarbes,” said D’Artagnan.	332.9886626908313
“It is probable you are ignorant of this little fact,” said Athos.	367.9240355155574
“My faith!” replied D’Artagnan, “you are well named, gentlemen; and my	238.93442189630417
adventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your	178.91950705374202
union is not founded upon contrasts.”	242.75463187088621
In the meantime, Porthos had come up, waved his hand to Athos, and then	219.29149642965666
turning toward D’Artagnan, stood quite astonished.	317.89065934964356
Let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished	180.01873962026656
his cloak.	327.0476020538189
“Ah, ah!” said he, “what does this mean?”	273.13231486017855
“This is the gentleman I am going to fight with,” said Athos, pointing	286.18278140292654
to D’Artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.	237.8639762753421
“Why, it is with him I am also going to fight,” said Porthos.	319.42972986566986
“But not before one o’clock,” replied D’Artagnan.	259.17735519485916
“And I also am to fight with this gentleman,” said Aramis, coming in	291.29700289550016
his turn onto the place.	311.9085585045395
“But not until two o’clock,” said D’Artagnan, with the same calmness.	186.10752534851343
“But what are you going to fight about, Athos?” asked Aramis.	202.0602911677655
“Faith! I don’t very well know. He hurt my shoulder. And you, Porthos?”	188.58567916602766
“Faith! I am going to fight—because I am going to fight,” answered	209.01484957947855
Porthos, reddening.	366.5782854790625
Athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass	284.4165462575496
over the lips of the young Gascon as he replied, “We had a short	218.7692369376635
discussion upon dress.”	182.3539039164163
“And you, Aramis?” asked Athos.	253.6326704818175
“Oh, ours is a theological quarrel,” replied Aramis, making a sign to	325.1763274359635
D’Artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.	276.75576277607524
Athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of D’Artagnan.	346.38822757889704
“Indeed?” said Athos.	334.6467878757393
“Yes; a passage of St. Augustine, upon which we could not agree,” said	363.14077705707
the Gascon.	365.56703347068964
“Decidedly, this is a clever fellow,” murmured Athos.	279.1245201660866
“And now you are assembled, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, “permit me to	358.50533480169094
offer you my apologies.”	316.09271611445854
At this word _apologies_, a cloud passed over the brow of Athos, a	173.28763784687337
haughty smile curled the lip of Porthos, and a negative sign was the	285.8562198819636
reply of Aramis.	278.45370367696324
“You do not understand me, gentlemen,” said D’Artagnan, throwing up his	353.8691024379865
head, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a	184.5204856631783
bright ray of the sun. “I asked to be excused in case I should not be	171.5225500162497
able to discharge my debt to all three; for Monsieur Athos has the	282.0718013585015
right to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your	263.63822333104434
bill, Monsieur Porthos, and render yours almost null, Monsieur Aramis.	358.53962669406724
And now, gentlemen, I repeat, excuse me, but on that account only,	209.06324963159497
and—on guard!”	253.81670126995874
At these words, with the most gallant air possible, D’Artagnan drew his	304.81096947904086
sword.	290.14654442508004
The blood had mounted to the head of D’Artagnan, and at that moment he	312.48465461603286
would have drawn his sword against all the Musketeers in the kingdom as	297.8512018944694
willingly as he now did against Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.	341.5047040353659
It was a quarter past midday. The sun was in its zenith, and the spot	267.28654152257957
chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.	287.8460344492544
“It is very hot,” said Athos, drawing his sword in its turn, “and yet I	286.9475293107496
cannot take off my doublet; for I just now felt my wound begin to bleed	236.71056962531634
again, and I should not like to annoy Monsieur with the sight of blood	186.30003219994725
which he has not drawn from me himself.”	264.3462848263988
“That is true, Monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and whether drawn by	259.8700884854422
myself or another, I assure you I shall always view with regret the	327.78470340675716
blood of so brave a gentleman. I will therefore fight in my doublet,	272.88474877961835
like yourself.”	342.3267421631401
“Come, come, enough of such compliments!” cried Porthos. “Remember, we	357.7210055994126
are waiting for our turns.”	270.1945725986759
“Speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,”	329.2244201812787
interrupted Aramis. “For my part, I think what they say is very well	341.41059004636986
said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen.”	232.70057267901618
“When you please, monsieur,” said Athos, putting himself on guard.	309.9661736401346
“I waited your orders,” said D’Artagnan, crossing swords.	365.58067441290825
But scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the Guards	269.5804510022998
of his Eminence, commanded by M. de Jussac, turned the corner of the	330.50943056328344
convent.	340.3525175117487
“The cardinal’s Guards!” cried Aramis and Porthos at the same time.	231.18416905387193
“Sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!”	197.46308341040378
But it was too late. The two combatants had been seen in a position	238.4000511456041
which left no doubt of their intentions.	180.3996247149665
“Halloo!” cried Jussac, advancing toward them and making a sign to his	331.241650716729
men to do so likewise, “halloo, Musketeers? Fighting here, are you? And	295.56506143287845
the edicts? What is become of them?”	335.51846697195765
“You are very generous, gentlemen of the Guards,” said Athos, full of	291.9581039002202
rancor, for Jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. “If	290.76822846994287
we were to see you fighting, I can assure you that we would make no	360.91856215976975
effort to prevent you. Leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a	210.09458034153585
little amusement without cost to yourselves.”	310.9893273363273
“Gentlemen,” said Jussac, “it is with great regret that I pronounce the	258.4844494273036
thing impossible. Duty before everything. Sheathe, then, if you please,	266.22965899286805
and follow us.”	245.4872194525268
“Monsieur,” said Aramis, parodying Jussac, “it would afford us great	271.5107762132627
pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves;	282.3252549143899
but unfortunately the thing is impossible—Monsieur de Tréville has	214.48008495150316
forbidden it. Pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do.”	263.71841506269084
This raillery exasperated Jussac. “We will charge upon you, then,” said	213.07216486707793
he, “if you disobey.”	330.0708187113646
“There are five of them,” said Athos, half aloud, “and we are but	369.5828929660806
three; we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my	211.1470420218771
part, I declare I will never appear again before the captain as a	227.71452046743823
conquered man.”	288.618939432672
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis instantly drew near one another, while	364.09242341821175
Jussac drew up his soldiers.	185.30077659079484
This short interval was sufficient to determine D’Artagnan on the part	243.88617970522063
he was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a	329.995444924268
man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal—the choice made,	356.90347026123453
it must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that	281.31056785180147
was to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a	346.82790860071054
minister more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man	262.4000341494425
perceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a	190.81009546012822
second. Turning towards Athos and his friends, “Gentlemen,” said he,	336.8954681683606
“allow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but	364.86948588826465
three, but it appears to me we are four.”	288.145225038676
“But you are not one of us,” said Porthos.	288.0012923717855
“That’s true,” replied D’Artagnan; “I have not the uniform, but I have	354.7592438699355
the spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it, monsieur, and	226.07673539375037
that impels me on.”	217.93235717435812
“Withdraw, young man,” cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and	175.56874538169654
the expression of his countenance, had guessed D’Artagnan’s design.	256.19838543303496
“You may retire; we consent to that. Save your skin; begone quickly.”	195.3343093354533
D’Artagnan did not budge.	346.00411821656405
“Decidedly, you are a brave fellow,” said Athos, pressing the young	366.68457773552177
man’s hand.	241.80813999972628
“Come, come, choose your part,” replied Jussac.	259.8870830802354
“Well,” said Porthos to Aramis, “we must do something.”	244.98761966381352
“Monsieur is full of generosity,” said Athos.	283.46573133938864
But all three reflected upon the youth of D’Artagnan, and dreaded his	186.5599593120111
inexperience.	324.8174013951477
“We should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of	183.8163240773162
a boy,” resumed Athos; “and yet it will not be the less said we were	272.6025089588452
four men.”	305.7393435845686
“Yes, but to yield!” said Porthos.	267.1157518243877
“That _is_ difficult,” replied Athos.	273.7770219067965
D’Artagnan comprehended their irresolution.	275.54905901195957
“Try me, gentlemen,” said he, “and I swear to you by my honor that I	317.56233569954645
will not go hence if we are conquered.”	244.38091767454029
“What is your name, my brave fellow?” said Athos.	290.69395477628154
“D’Artagnan, monsieur.”	202.70594944082987
“Well, then, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan, forward!” cried	233.8660681764589
Athos.	264.6122920662983
“Come, gentlemen, have you decided?” cried Jussac for the third time.	196.59946756959167
“It is done, gentlemen,” said Athos.	174.1751607858615
“And what is your choice?” asked Jussac.	233.15974390444688
“We are about to have the honor of charging you,” replied Aramis,	266.1016588294682
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.	338.923277953464
“Ah! You resist, do you?” cried Jussac.	311.20146673054137
“S’blood; does that astonish you?”	191.22378031657138
And the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which	203.19175393396455
however did not exclude a certain degree of method.	236.3010829205616
Athos fixed upon a certain Cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal’s.	220.70190940552686
Porthos had Bicarat, and Aramis found himself opposed to two	314.7319799538292
adversaries. As to D’Artagnan, he sprang toward Jussac himself.	267.93474307210374
The heart of the young Gascon beat as if it would burst through his	237.56205874195086
side—not from fear, God be thanked, he had not the shade of it, but	357.09133963077863
with emulation; he fought like a furious tiger, turning ten times round	218.87654350954796
his adversary, and changing his ground and his guard twenty times.	260.3005107837014
Jussac was, as was then said, a fine blade, and had had much practice;	302.80298727925947
nevertheless it required all his skill to defend himself against an	284.41617843834183
adversary who, active and energetic, departed every instant from	316.16611517675574
received rules, attacking him on all sides at once, and yet parrying	321.711597883959
like a man who had the greatest respect for his own epidermis.	347.0144680097285
This contest at length exhausted Jussac’s patience. Furious at being	342.6102585596926
held in check by one whom he had considered a boy, he became warm and	336.09253620446964
began to make mistakes. D’Artagnan, who though wanting in practice had	214.76718554759617
a sound theory, redoubled his agility. Jussac, anxious to put an end to	300.9598684089067
this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but	200.22580105074888
the latter parried it; and while Jussac was recovering himself, glided	309.824306787209
like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his	314.68515245181754
body. Jussac fell like a dead mass.	209.3689801128654
D’Artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of	242.976512547599
battle.	215.6043886623061
Aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him	239.03639808120835
warmly. Nevertheless, Aramis was in a good situation, and able to	302.8486323006125
defend himself.	247.72715386047776
Bicarat and Porthos had just made counterhits. Porthos had received a	356.6631281949808
thrust through his arm, and Bicarat one through his thigh. But neither	247.62606965783925
of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.	203.86521324041286
Athos, wounded anew by Cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not	355.5819402186114
give way a foot. He only changed his sword hand, and fought with his	315.88770165140807
left hand.	221.16066653350202
According to the laws of dueling at that period, D’Artagnan was at	173.22697049852619
liberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out	195.93274879102427
which of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from	301.6234208627013
Athos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died	352.49900437508234
rather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask	252.16271800839232
assistance. D’Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang	361.6533810683097
to the side of Cahusac, crying, “To me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay	312.8062050514138
you!”	238.6863534618887
Cahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone	272.894780302528
supported him, sank upon his knee.	244.6516621485864
“S’blood!” cried he to D’Artagnan, “do not kill him, young man, I beg	338.421473888063
of you. I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and	201.40609976260532
sound again. Disarm him only—make sure of his sword. That’s it! Very	319.8484005943462
well done!”	353.37802028011276
The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly	231.60139278617714
twenty paces from him. D’Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the	177.1766012270758
same instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but	368.25778561534196
D’Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot	304.07647571560676
upon it.	224.42612440659548
Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized	331.33945151764567
his rapier, and returned toward D’Artagnan; but on his way he met	320.00873186958427
Athos, who during his relief which D’Artagnan had procured him had	337.78514664859256
recovered his breath, and who, for fear that D’Artagnan would kill his	358.8447324007657
enemy, wished to resume the fight.	362.4741976930296
D’Artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging Athos not to leave	278.46949086920023
him alone; and in a few minutes Cahusac fell, with a sword thrust	241.78542174515252
through his throat.	346.8960895071373
At the same instant Aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his	323.8827424152323
fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.	176.258840933295
There only then remained Porthos and Bicarat. Porthos made a thousand	300.0568169391004
flourishes, asking Bicarat what o’clock it could be, and offering him	216.11732068256106
his compliments upon his brother’s having just obtained a company in	280.5664909234838
the regiment of Navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing.	174.6725172887031
Bicarat was one of those iron men who never fell dead.	337.185646873579
Nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. The watch might come up and	250.85929186619495
take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.	273.34472400840446
Athos, Aramis, and D’Artagnan surrounded Bicarat, and required him to	355.4326389672544
surrender. Though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,	247.98399902477286
Bicarat wished to hold out; but Jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,	267.4971142856963
cried out to him to yield. Bicarat was a Gascon, as D’Artagnan was; he	172.79855908166607
turned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two	310.98449524786236
parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword,	320.82861767301796
“Here,” cried he, parodying a verse of the Bible, “here will Bicarat	217.5923804174244
die; for I only am left, and they seek my life.”	359.8546320890926
“But there are four against you; leave off, I command you.”	231.6449764937187
“Ah, if you command me, that’s another thing,” said Bicarat. “As you	173.74116604552052
are my commander, it is my duty to obey.” And springing backward, he	322.50800283267824
broke his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering	315.02570395481723
it, threw the pieces over the convent wall, and crossed his arms,	317.256264689426
whistling a cardinalist air.	189.07474705300297
Bravery is always respected, even in an enemy. The Musketeers saluted	222.44309510352943
Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.	338.14444744614354
D’Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left	231.6046006721475
standing, they bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis’s adversaries	280.1181760339175
who was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The fourth, as we	213.31469558417604
have said, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying away four	184.45218375668222
swords out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward	176.5755090701626
the hôtel of M. de Tréville.	348.69942110634867
They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and	333.49347399615414
taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a	295.82113905567985
triumphal march. The heart of D’Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched	341.9382791612801
between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly.	189.18544460785847
“If I am not yet a Musketeer,” said he to his new friends, as he passed	342.4406235634384
through the gateway of M. de Tréville’s hôtel, “at least I have entered	262.3811073728101
upon my apprenticeship, haven’t I?”	185.6176678823539
Chapter VI.	303.6965295808888
HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII.	335.72896617181254
This affair made a great noise. M. de Tréville scolded his Musketeers	210.47823386574012
in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be	288.8270871415527
lost in gaining the king, M. de Tréville hastened to report himself at	311.3290856209353
the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the	338.08390597392884
cardinal, and M. de Tréville was informed that the king was busy and	362.0462495367807
could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Tréville	262.124152601354
attended the king’s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was	290.3685632302984
very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de	205.83809957078677
Tréville at a distance—	182.1261271779835
“Come here, Monsieur Captain,” said he, “come here, that I may growl at	290.24814000299784
you. Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints	212.3067617204501
against your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this	323.634540099146
evening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these Musketeers of yours are	207.7446281099491
very devils—fellows to be hanged.”	179.21142322186782
“No, sire,” replied Tréville, who saw at the first glance how things	292.46789366715956
would go, “on the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs,	369.08720448366887
and have but one desire, I’ll be their warranty. And that is that their	286.6718355982109
swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty’s service.	298.7662004061972
But what are they to do? The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are	356.6172187764673
forever seeking quarrels with them, and for the honor of the corps	351.7666739523863
even, the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves.”	228.98702404770515
“Listen to Monsieur de Tréville,” said the king; “listen to him! Would	291.46436029438246
not one say he was speaking of a religious community? In truth, my dear	284.1072704886722
Captain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it	248.78715765589476
to Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey. But don’t	286.56762904111986
fancy that I am going to take you on your bare word. I am called Louis	322.00539513682236
the Just, Monsieur de Tréville, and by and by, by and by we will see.”	345.57054290500616
“Ah, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait	308.1340475537951
patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your Majesty.”	293.4343054244577
“Wait, then, monsieur, wait,” said the king; “I will not detain you	225.58085308024488
long.”	235.81697179800096
In fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had	340.9332493413039
won, he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne—if we	221.2499234091758
may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance. The	178.8750869979441
king therefore arose a minute after, and putting the money which lay	220.10876698743257
before him into his pocket, the major part of which arose from his	209.71791564589975
winnings, “La Vieuville,” said he, “take my place; I must speak to	293.49987743092237
Monsieur de Tréville on an affair of importance. Ah, I had eighty louis	228.65525204821336
before me; put down the same sum, so that they who have lost may have	353.6229161014653
nothing to complain of. Justice before everything.”	353.546546156313
Then turning toward M. de Tréville and walking with him toward the	282.6892966596091
embrasure of a window, “Well, monsieur,” continued he, “you say it is	349.34736926383357
his Eminence’s Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers?”	351.00325217975416
“Yes, sire, as they always do.”	273.3375332382652
“And how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear	216.96672547524676
Captain, a judge must hear both sides.”	339.1336915146891
“Good Lord! In the most simple and natural manner possible. Three of my	351.90290785386185
best soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness	263.7367212716192
you have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to the	313.62544448632707
king, his service much at heart—three of my best soldiers, I say,	249.1042332985992
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young	284.6125022729261
fellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning.	195.64498639591875
The party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had	277.0554049920281
appointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by	341.86420209393333
de Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did	228.31673974628282
not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention	214.94343574595752
against the edicts.”	290.6248942296072
“Ah, ah! You incline me to think so,” said the king. “There is no doubt	326.09784707415054
they went thither to fight themselves.”	282.48911685543214
“I do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what	327.4939649339121
five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place	334.43977088456313
as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes.”	226.24952140807028
“Yes, you are right, Tréville, you are right!”	358.17911193031273
“Then, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot	257.0538471619136
their private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be	195.81900825429457
ignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but the	222.82951460298978
king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the	229.23923419695643
cardinal.”	189.8102233074231
“Yes, Tréville, yes,” said the king, in a melancholy tone; “and it is	328.18243334466956
very sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in France, two heads to	314.34660872637437
royalty. But all this will come to an end, Tréville, will come to an	211.98011652464726
end. You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the	290.5239162335797
Musketeers?”	205.47858362845375
“I say that it is probable that things have fallen out so, but I will	361.8507960354375
not swear to it, sire. You know how difficult it is to discover the	270.65622125576607
truth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which	257.449266930931
causes Louis XIII. to be named the Just—”	292.4796793428467
“You are right, Tréville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers.	331.3287449974408
They had a youth with them?”	364.0955758788408
“Yes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king’s	262.2701170267532
Musketeers—one of whom was wounded—and a youth not only maintained	181.46257828795157
their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal’s	351.6472868164276
Guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.”	348.0471746405967
“Why, this is a victory!” cried the king, all radiant, “a complete	172.63682992691167
victory!”	236.76969400788596
“Yes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce.”	292.65216031675294
“Four men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?”	283.3010045888974
“One hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably	238.60598654630982
on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to	190.53087163673254
your Majesty.”	301.07007697129507
“How does he call himself?”	308.16673372138905
“D’Artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my oldest friends—the son of	267.0354685102506
a man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the	254.99671306912853
civil war.”	338.1796443035629
“And you say this young man behaved himself well? Tell me how,	322.4076131641132
Tréville—you know how I delight in accounts of war and fighting.”	235.74130983238712
And Louis XIII. twisted his mustache proudly, placing his hand upon his	241.7797812854692
hip.	295.24230674751874
“Sire,” resumed Tréville, “as I told you, Monsieur d’Artagnan is little	240.49538241860148
more than a boy; and as he has not the honor of being a Musketeer, he	356.6811655645475
was dressed as a citizen. The Guards of the cardinal, perceiving his	281.6055256659595
youth and that he did not belong to the corps, invited him to retire	336.17787885750334
before they attacked.”	241.13610371897295
“So you may plainly see, Tréville,” interrupted the king, “it was they	232.80080999099965
who attacked?”	266.0437805464133
“That is true, sire; there can be no more doubt on that head. They	334.30020315730724
called upon him then to retire; but he answered that he was a Musketeer	321.04259754583325
at heart, entirely devoted to your Majesty, and that therefore he would	296.019003865912
remain with Messieurs the Musketeers.”	296.66391156569193
“Brave young man!” murmured the king.	288.4797461403521
“Well, he did remain with them; and your Majesty has in him so firm a	332.4973579897277
champion that it was he who gave Jussac the terrible sword thrust which	324.59277609688405
has made the cardinal so angry.”	174.2984990694752
“He who wounded Jussac!” cried the king, “he, a boy! Tréville, that’s	269.3086201467655
impossible!”	353.91084818478885
“It is as I have the honor to relate it to your Majesty.”	337.15536227429516
“Jussac, one of the first swordsmen in the kingdom?”	201.48444894393958
“Well, sire, for once he found his master.”	281.17950494699056
“I will see this young man, Tréville—I will see him; and if anything	285.1946193970208
can be done—well, we will make it our business.”	309.5231339728016
“When will your Majesty deign to receive him?”	356.05852385306383
“Tomorrow, at midday, Tréville.”	266.2417706984059
“Shall I bring him alone?”	187.61198339181212
“No, bring me all four together. I wish to thank them all at once.	282.3720964829956
Devoted men are so rare, Tréville, by the back staircase. It is useless	287.64528750839173
to let the cardinal know.”	301.8044702461227
“Yes, sire.”	219.69124495948145
“You understand, Tréville—an edict is still an edict, it is forbidden	298.2688802646368
to fight, after all.”	201.13704648747216
“But this encounter, sire, is quite out of the ordinary conditions of a	249.85598200362904
duel. It is a brawl; and the proof is that there were five of the	312.5315523265423
cardinal’s Guardsmen against my three Musketeers and Monsieur	259.32803859768836
d’Artagnan.”	275.5956163674921
“That is true,” said the king; “but never mind, Tréville, come still by	276.2536145233435
the back staircase.”	305.5656730548449
Tréville smiled; but as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon	253.3527968670445
this child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king	244.25795393275544
respectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.	349.9814140186644
That evening the three Musketeers were informed of the honor accorded	319.2270738730171
them. As they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not	230.41504640149856
much excited; but D’Artagnan, with his Gascon imagination, saw in it	283.1877494052796
his future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. By eight	218.74996527453166
o’clock in the morning he was at the apartment of Athos.	352.00695681133186
D’Artagnan found the Musketeer dressed and ready to go out. As the hour	358.2343887086399
to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with	358.51466907712353
Porthos and Aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated	342.6575006254553
near the stables of the Luxembourg. Athos invited D’Artagnan to follow	286.4271933523588
them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he	204.89102982592757
accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine o’clock in the	368.3271831847889
morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.	363.4604672937047
The two Musketeers were already there, and were playing together.	209.11532019804676
Athos, who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with	188.64966090085443
D’Artagnan to the opposite side and challenged them; but at the first	323.0490420975581
effort he made, although he played with his left hand, he found that	290.75384188865644
his wound was yet too recent to allow of such exertion. D’Artagnan	319.59553368193065
remained, therefore, alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of	271.5108391618605
the game to play it regularly they only continued giving balls to one	189.60346600677912
another without counting. But one of these balls, launched by Porthos’	178.89183510134023
herculean hand, passed so close to D’Artagnan’s face that he thought	367.48989708640914
that if, instead of passing near, it had hit him, his audience would	202.99300863805067
have been probably lost, as it would have been impossible for him to	209.74971641945555
present himself before the king. Now, as upon this audience, in his	192.3666192330266
Gascon imagination, depended his future life, he saluted Aramis and	356.26042300872575
Porthos politely, declaring that he would not resume the game until he	369.05008976256283
should be prepared to play with them on more equal terms, and went and	338.0675847230274
took his place near the cord and in the gallery.	222.4559842706843
Unfortunately for D’Artagnan, among the spectators was one of his	350.4981839654647
Eminence’s Guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his	329.9258237936557
companions, which had happened only the day before, had promised	272.1464423082621
himself to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. He believed this	344.78743461908533
opportunity was now come and addressed his neighbor: “It is not	266.9009930053246
astonishing that that young man should be afraid of a ball, for he is	288.2087958701767
doubtless a Musketeer apprentice.”	221.735610055184
D’Artagnan turned round as if a serpent had stung him, and fixed his	325.7317653488127
eyes intensely upon the Guardsman who had just made this insolent	317.65823397545245
speech.	300.1074742262457
“_Pardieu_,” resumed the latter, twisting his mustache, “look at me as	216.17988313402464
long as you like, my little gentleman! I have said what I have said.”	253.21384477646478
“And as since that which you have said is too clear to require any	330.55999608594794
explanation,” replied D’Artagnan, in a low voice, “I beg you to follow	283.6311762243365
me.”	245.45745896623197
“And when?” asked the Guardsman, with the same jeering air.	230.42036294760715
“At once, if you please.”	354.5614898543684
“And you know who I am, without doubt?”	354.43433877181803
“I? I am completely ignorant; nor does it much disquiet me.”	172.8563395740499
“You’re in the wrong there; for if you knew my name, perhaps you would	200.24253605344938
not be so pressing.”	208.5531338035806
“What is your name?”	184.6675324577989
“Bernajoux, at your service.”	282.4976827684019
“Well, then, Monsieur Bernajoux,” said D’Artagnan, tranquilly, “I will	307.1098770489913
wait for you at the door.”	293.2737811353619
“Go, monsieur, I will follow you.”	352.1851186102873
“Do not hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out	312.44811778592293
together. You must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be	214.49050473317772
in the way.”	242.0046448240257
“That’s true,” said the Guardsman, astonished that his name had not	183.04927672813898
produced more effect upon the young man.	251.5486136835047
Indeed, the name of Bernajoux was known to all the world, D’Artagnan	286.5777551515847
alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most	214.7605952309612
frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal	310.13515240086343
could not repress.	239.2798189773992
Porthos and Aramis were so engaged with their game, and Athos was	326.6846955274066
watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive	245.53028519042792
their young companion go out, who, as he had told the Guardsman of his	252.33414112894064
Eminence, stopped outside the door. An instant after, the Guardsman	245.41889347057983
descended in his turn. As D’Artagnan had no time to lose, on account of	241.5400464149722
the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes	247.31159922429734
around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary,	242.1722288508367
“My faith! It is fortunate for you, although your name is Bernajoux, to	342.788685592059
have only to deal with an apprentice Musketeer. Never mind; be content,	276.87514510427275
I will do my best. On guard!”	368.6121174426388
“But,” said he whom D’Artagnan thus provoked, “it appears to me that	252.23892058969628
this place is badly chosen, and that we should be better behind the	242.91597811917146
Abbey St. Germain or in the Pré-aux-Clercs.”	369.7154052314654
“What you say is full of sense,” replied D’Artagnan; “but unfortunately	367.35335448919983
I have very little time to spare, having an appointment at twelve	368.6809867633634
precisely. On guard, then, monsieur, on guard!”	338.71729916579227
Bernajoux was not a man to have such a compliment paid to him twice. In	331.76316544228484
an instant his sword glittered in his hand, and he sprang upon his	308.76802562681326
adversary, whom, thanks to his great youthfulness, he hoped to	194.66306353828173
intimidate.	271.37594706770653
But D’Artagnan had on the preceding day served his apprenticeship.	310.5331087648334
Fresh sharpened by his victory, full of hopes of future favor, he was	321.769774110359
resolved not to recoil a step. So the two swords were crossed close to	253.42786139770436
the hilts, and as D’Artagnan stood firm, it was his adversary who made	227.43236794472034
the retreating step; but D’Artagnan seized the moment at which, in this	257.3012223588377
movement, the sword of Bernajoux deviated from the line. He freed his	367.6508796789732
weapon, made a lunge, and touched his adversary on the shoulder.	258.4290026009099
D’Artagnan immediately made a step backward and raised his sword; but	368.40659649015356
Bernajoux cried out that it was nothing, and rushing blindly upon him,	237.01566190506088
absolutely spitted himself upon D’Artagnan’s sword. As, however, he did	342.57019201450294
not fall, as he did not declare himself conquered, but only broke away	233.4258436525363
toward the hôtel of M. de la Trémouille, in whose service he had a	214.9851570431195
relative, D’Artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound	213.34906824918465
his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt	327.985408239696
would soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise	222.03071354428585
which arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the	236.54631526724623
friends of the Guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some	282.48102829535014
words with D’Artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell	171.8070758615185
upon the conqueror. But Athos, Porthos, and Aramis quickly appeared in	226.76282687226666
their turn, and the moment the two Guardsmen attacked their young	252.01730936576365
companion, drove them back. Bernajoux now fell, and as the Guardsmen	313.46415432479904
were only two against four, they began to cry, “To the rescue! The	302.4424922018044
Hôtel de la Trémouille!” At these cries, all who were in the hôtel	322.95752220602253
rushed out and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried	291.91034389746255
aloud, “To the rescue, Musketeers!”	302.1235181010796
This cry was generally heeded; for the Musketeers were known to be	335.799161219105
enemies of the cardinal, and were beloved on account of the hatred they	178.69785347601163
bore to his Eminence. Thus the soldiers of other companies than those	251.1102148248278
which belonged to the Red Duke, as Aramis had called him, often took	251.9650313384937
part with the king’s Musketeers in these quarrels. Of three Guardsmen	323.9434745094771
of the company of M. Dessessart who were passing, two came to the	213.78239921398438
assistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the hôtel	317.8436761648088
of M. de Tréville, crying, “To the rescue, Musketeers! To the rescue!”	274.48263894751483
As usual, this hôtel was full of soldiers of this company, who hastened	324.13105742377445
to the succor of their comrades. The _mêlée_ became general, but	239.01665106326084
strength was on the side of the Musketeers. The cardinal’s Guards and	191.45778050280552
M. de la Trémouille’s people retreated into the hôtel, the doors of	210.01892118784994
which they closed just in time to prevent their enemies from entering	204.4960053402803
with them. As to the wounded man, he had been taken in at once, and, as	264.32500885028554
we have said, in a very bad state.	195.09276176546453
Excitement was at its height among the Musketeers and their allies, and	196.20084341505512
they even began to deliberate whether they should not set fire to the	225.13869926727952
hôtel to punish the insolence of M. de la Trémouille’s domestics in	224.5655294183733
daring to make a _sortie_ upon the king’s Musketeers. The proposition	289.22188227912784
had been made, and received with enthusiasm, when fortunately eleven	278.9947591769958
o’clock struck. D’Artagnan and his companions remembered their	305.21741854127697
audience, and as they would very much have regretted that such an	250.07583559627278
opportunity should be lost, they succeeded in calming their friends,	298.97355085531984
who contented themselves with hurling some paving stones against the	248.97548657372857
gates; but the gates were too strong. They soon tired of the sport.	270.7473286493834
Besides, those who must be considered the leaders of the enterprise had	203.90793368030046
quit the group and were making their way toward the hôtel of M. de	200.23513222433655
Tréville, who was waiting for them, already informed of this fresh	184.8345206477772
disturbance.	315.3255767425154
“Quick to the Louvre,” said he, “to the Louvre without losing an	215.49809215035208
instant, and let us endeavor to see the king before he is prejudiced by	182.38780881935043
the cardinal. We will describe the thing to him as a consequence of the	255.74594193177967
affair of yesterday, and the two will pass off together.”	226.69817917176886
M. de Tréville, accompanied by the four young fellows, directed his	237.07934510294893
course toward the Louvre; but to the great astonishment of the captain	316.6510475751136
of the Musketeers, he was informed that the king had gone stag hunting	243.5708694939125
in the forest of St. Germain. M. de Tréville required this intelligence	319.25276569294283
to be repeated to him twice, and each time his companions saw his brow	195.91523315321433
become darker.	277.8150919459612
“Had his Majesty,” asked he, “any intention of holding this hunting	180.31595268504907
party yesterday?”	229.21461283167386
“No, your Excellency,” replied the valet de chambre, “the Master of the	195.7196093255767
Hounds came this morning to inform him that he had marked down a stag.	285.08634378789833
At first the king answered that he would not go; but he could not	365.0052343098354
resist his love of sport, and set out after dinner.”	200.314127412344
“And the king has seen the cardinal?” asked M. de Tréville.	342.13703177690013
“In all probability he has,” replied the valet, “for I saw the horses	190.57912838225943
harnessed to his Eminence’s carriage this morning, and when I asked	351.2772523276936
where he was going, they told me, ‘To St. Germain.’”	367.0520484759588
“He is beforehand with us,” said M. de Tréville. “Gentlemen, I will see	346.5741304202452
the king this evening; but as to you, I do not advise you to risk doing	351.9632494152052
so.”	306.3419013027042
This advice was too reasonable, and moreover came from a man who knew	342.9290509724217
the king too well, to allow the four young men to dispute it. M. de	270.12092225216225
Tréville recommended everyone to return home and wait for news.	196.79659035268412
On entering his hôtel, M. de Tréville thought it best to be first in	335.85779959158907
making the complaint. He sent one of his servants to M. de la	296.00442256552515
Trémouille with a letter in which he begged of him to eject the	204.21764718424382
cardinal’s Guardsmen from his house, and to reprimand his people for	305.44089364149806
their audacity in making _sortie_ against the king’s Musketeers. But M.	344.1414669830425
de la Trémouille—already prejudiced by his esquire, whose relative, as	212.38189914639085
we already know, Bernajoux was—replied that it was neither for M. de	255.17880176599004
Tréville nor the Musketeers to complain, but, on the contrary, for him,	339.4310297400625
whose people the Musketeers had assaulted and whose hôtel they had	225.4337049750463
endeavored to burn. Now, as the debate between these two nobles might	176.8935038221313
last a long time, each becoming, naturally, more firm in his own	244.26185486119016
opinion, M. de Tréville thought of an expedient which might terminate	177.6300457671253
it quietly. This was to go himself to M. de la Trémouille.	305.1266285710469
He repaired, therefore, immediately to his hôtel, and caused himself to	268.661474887196
be announced.	187.41743194066478
The two nobles saluted each other politely, for if no friendship	312.16562015732
existed between them, there was at least esteem. Both were men of	256.9228009663448
courage and honor; and as M. de la Trémouille—a Protestant, and seeing	302.16357204889266
the king seldom—was of no party, he did not, in general, carry any bias	267.6157975124836
into his social relations. This time, however, his address, although	337.5658776480229
polite, was cooler than usual.	244.77357573463425
“Monsieur,” said M. de Tréville, “we fancy that we have each cause to	208.8628188197764
complain of the other, and I am come to endeavor to clear up this	214.38265518403674
affair.”	287.67198912993825
“I have no objection,” replied M. de la Trémouille, “but I warn you	321.80596614548716
that I am well informed, and all the fault is with your Musketeers.”	205.96430584356173
“You are too just and reasonable a man, monsieur!” said Tréville, “not	217.9554965833127
to accept the proposal I am about to make to you.”	214.96051678676767
“Make it, monsieur, I listen.”	353.2530130273806
“How is Monsieur Bernajoux, your esquire’s relative?”	220.2764288081352
“Why, monsieur, very ill indeed! In addition to the sword thrust in his	288.75913431427944
arm, which is not dangerous, he has received another right through his	196.19311608132284
lungs, of which the doctor says bad things.”	189.57459284252053
“But has the wounded man retained his senses?”	307.92166915306655
“Perfectly.”	302.10015193958094
“Does he talk?”	180.63151370987367
“With difficulty, but he can speak.”	352.85677085016584
“Well, monsieur, let us go to him. Let us adjure him, in the name of	333.1517733055024
the God before whom he must perhaps appear, to speak the truth. I will	292.842374950034
take him for judge in his own cause, monsieur, and will believe what he	236.85626609978937
will say.”	243.52991918703853
M. de la Trémouille reflected for an instant; then as it was difficult	310.4493178418336
to suggest a more reasonable proposal, he agreed to it.	361.49736247596854
Both descended to the chamber in which the wounded man lay. The latter,	175.01142704597336
on seeing these two noble lords who came to visit him, endeavored to	186.177773849183
raise himself up in his bed; but he was too weak, and exhausted by the	220.7479071763031
effort, he fell back again almost senseless.	258.56302560853067
M. de la Trémouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts,	370.1429678931848
which recalled him to life. Then M. de Tréville, unwilling that it	222.2540041996983
should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man, requested M.	171.1429864488398
de la Trémouille to interrogate him himself.	328.44919543093874
That happened which M. de Tréville had foreseen. Placed between life	343.5656936471805
and death, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing	263.28387994639
the truth; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it	366.3961952998825
had passed.	298.2316085620804
This was all that M. de Tréville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy	358.8382603543947
convalescence, took leave of M. de la Trémouille, returned to his	198.24847564713366
hôtel, and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited	257.0969747493576
their company at dinner.	286.0800822267576
M. de Tréville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist,	306.21170396353676
though. It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation	238.00262922730786
during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his	336.49617283862256
Eminence’s Guardsmen had received. Now, as D’Artagnan had been the hero	260.25972270678386
of these two fights, it was upon him that all the felicitations fell,	266.8619670044464
which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good	208.08212846903962
comrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that they could	177.3992864163862
very well afford him his.	261.83158831195044
Toward six o’clock M. de Tréville announced that it was time to go to	253.83736762385251
the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was	210.54936141528154
past, instead of claiming the _entrée_ by the back stairs, he placed	368.7035686428693
himself with the four young men in the antechamber. The king had not	196.69975154521381
yet returned from hunting. Our young men had been waiting about half an	259.61769078927483
hour, amid a crowd of courtiers, when all the doors were thrown open,	304.14128360882444
and his Majesty was announced.	265.7385420825366
At his announcement D’Artagnan felt himself tremble to the very marrow	192.7882458090733
of his bones. The coming instant would in all probability decide the	258.978427322398
rest of his life. His eyes therefore were fixed in a sort of agony upon	315.8849639697432
the door through which the king must enter.	268.5893755102304
Louis XIII. appeared, walking fast. He was in hunting costume covered	342.05638711731024
with dust, wearing large boots, and holding a whip in his hand. At the	236.90247702589068
first glance, D’Artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.	185.07157250044853
This disposition, visible as it was in his Majesty, did not prevent the	193.85103266892185
courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. In royal	262.84797659751985
antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not	214.5006215095268
to be seen at all. The three Musketeers therefore did not hesitate to	208.14049052472132
make a step forward. D’Artagnan on the contrary remained concealed	307.0311029636078
behind them; but although the king knew Athos, Porthos, and Aramis	333.6416278196626
personally, he passed before them without speaking or looking—indeed,	240.7483189763569
as if he had never seen them before. As for M. de Tréville, when the	270.80563914663816
eyes of the king fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much	362.66792514014327
firmness that it was the king who dropped his eyes; after which his	197.84534781056485
Majesty, grumbling, entered his apartment.	242.62709279645816
“Matters go but badly,” said Athos, smiling; “and we shall not be made	229.59192250748222
Chevaliers of the Order this time.”	262.9354397775203
“Wait here ten minutes,” said M. de Tréville; “and if at the expiration	274.9294724554512
of ten minutes you do not see me come out, return to my hôtel, for it	203.77258124507424
will be useless for you to wait for me longer.”	208.72258577902113
The four young men waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, twenty	300.10679170924715
minutes; and seeing that M. de Tréville did not return, went away very	365.59250870923154
uneasy as to what was going to happen.	263.2200293344796
M. de Tréville entered the king’s cabinet boldly, and found his Majesty	367.01857613152504
in a very ill humor, seated on an armchair, beating his boot with the	320.0698460478835
handle of his whip. This, however, did not prevent his asking, with the	253.8102474350706
greatest coolness, after his Majesty’s health.	311.61473529254084
“Bad, monsieur, bad!” replied the king; “I am bored.”	322.59868706327296
This was, in fact, the worst complaint of Louis XIII., who would	319.4502267336312
sometimes take one of his courtiers to a window and say, “Monsieur	302.3570004510876
So-and-so, let us weary ourselves together.”	246.7394253052194
“How! Your Majesty is bored? Have you not enjoyed the pleasures of the	233.13704654550352
chase today?”	215.84578799715737
“A fine pleasure, indeed, monsieur! Upon my soul, everything	264.3269896223505
degenerates; and I don’t know whether it is the game which leaves no	356.58939462356284
scent, or the dogs that have no noses. We started a stag of ten	285.5294972074013
branches. We chased him for six hours, and when he was near being	274.7408450254386
taken—when St. Simon was already putting his horn to his mouth to sound	328.4363383913668
the _halali_—crack, all the pack takes the wrong scent and sets off	173.97445946288778
after a two-year-older. I shall be obliged to give up hunting, as I	329.9034415164654
have given up hawking. Ah, I am an unfortunate king, Monsieur de	305.76103984644436
Tréville! I had but one gerfalcon, and he died day before yesterday.”	204.69825540298626
“Indeed, sire, I wholly comprehend your disappointment. The misfortune	260.7697043522985
is great; but I think you have still a good number of falcons, sparrow	343.0708703299495
hawks, and tiercels.”	307.4292522926336
“And not a man to instruct them. Falconers are declining. I know no one	212.737532665044
but myself who is acquainted with the noble art of venery. After me it	171.39634158890377
will all be over, and people will hunt with gins, snares, and traps. If	196.71807514067356
I had but the time to train pupils! But there is the cardinal always at	242.15293669698886
hand, who does not leave me a moment’s repose; who talks to me about	242.79175395768772
Spain, who talks to me about Austria, who talks to me about England!	352.59379163469634
Ah! _à propos_ of the cardinal, Monsieur de Tréville, I am vexed with	346.79765031488114
you!”	311.3833849758405
This was the chance at which M. de Tréville waited for the king. He	293.5860667396722
knew the king of old, and he knew that all these complaints were but a	198.64928626583395
preface—a sort of excitation to encourage himself—and that he had now	192.1894392808897
come to his point at last.	234.19430407676646
“And in what have I been so unfortunate as to displease your Majesty?”	197.90508868525112
asked M. de Tréville, feigning the most profound astonishment.	207.77497548394356
“Is it thus you perform your charge, monsieur?” continued the king,	274.7648520153032
without directly replying to de Tréville’s question. “Is it for this I	223.6578592749925
name you captain of my Musketeers, that they should assassinate a man,	274.8973666020666
disturb a whole quarter, and endeavor to set fire to Paris, without	257.41590527558253
your saying a word? But yet,” continued the king, “undoubtedly my haste	220.26966293757027
accuses you wrongfully; without doubt the rioters are in prison, and	171.3228346506777
you come to tell me justice is done.”	211.08904275427818
“Sire,” replied M. de Tréville, calmly, “on the contrary, I come to	353.0523414128129
demand it of you.”	261.7864878017544
“And against whom?” cried the king.	196.85426496349112
“Against calumniators,” said M. de Tréville.	238.5270272580674
“Ah! This is something new,” replied the king. “Will you tell me that	360.0126453770624
your three damned Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and your	359.0106472382771
youngster from Béarn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor	226.16943781025404
Bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably	303.98240474074146
by this time he is dead? Will you tell me that they did not lay siege	289.0710851218426
to the hôtel of the Duc de la Trémouille, and that they did not	339.3480292173151
endeavor to burn it?—which would not, perhaps, have been a great	320.2591770462798
misfortune in time of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of	356.65260174322214
Huguenots, but which is, in time of peace, a frightful example. Tell	347.9571689566938
me, now, can you deny all this?”	264.8093810672418
“And who told you this fine story, sire?” asked Tréville, quietly.	333.8466607674068
“Who has told me this fine story, monsieur? Who should it be but he who	281.2647172346338
watches while I sleep, who labors while I amuse myself, who conducts	176.92293518005852
everything at home and abroad—in France as in Europe?”	185.42635113669942
“Your Majesty probably refers to God,” said M. de Tréville; “for I know	271.7223017298203
no one except God who can be so far above your Majesty.”	196.86290480861763
“No, monsieur; I speak of the prop of the state, of my only servant, of	224.7979207803436
my only friend—of the cardinal.”	296.55685532600205
“His Eminence is not his holiness, sire.”	369.50256117260784
“What do you mean by that, monsieur?”	201.52538227376013
“That it is only the Pope who is infallible, and that this	302.87909469617983
infallibility does not extend to cardinals.”	241.61720687462764
“You mean to say that he deceives me; you mean to say that he betrays	319.1743223619618
me? You accuse him, then? Come, speak; avow freely that you accuse	205.16759150374742
him!”	246.67352310278528
“No, sire, but I say that he deceives himself. I say that he is	249.44594438496347
ill-informed. I say that he has hastily accused your Majesty’s	325.74109836288994
Musketeers, toward whom he is unjust, and that he has not obtained his	282.0952595708803
information from good sources.”	214.5762333395994
“The accusation comes from Monsieur de la Trémouille, from the duke	339.32634510028413
himself. What do you say to that?”	278.4067542810456
“I might answer, sire, that he is too deeply interested in the question	285.2782602140592
to be a very impartial witness; but so far from that, sire, I know the	338.8401124743326
duke to be a royal gentleman, and I refer the matter to him—but upon	303.92400047622766
one condition, sire.”	219.01344560028946
“What?”	314.8262382272958
“It is that your Majesty will make him come here, will interrogate him	172.37129813309008
yourself, _tête-à-tête_, without witnesses, and that I shall see your	288.23557685121494
Majesty as soon as you have seen the duke.”	346.25860751658337
“What, then! You will bind yourself,” cried the king, “by what Monsieur	253.92809153395268
de la Trémouille shall say?”	288.2362512696712
“Yes, sire.”	317.4392309155992
“You will accept his judgment?”	326.38547464459253
“Undoubtedly.”	254.42940992830177
“And you will submit to the reparation he may require?”	236.29739669830798
“Certainly.”	266.9171429824018
“La Chesnaye,” said the king. “La Chesnaye!”	235.10656637362183
Louis XIII.’s confidential valet, who never left the door, entered in	259.410563125203
reply to the call.	334.86481127715916
“La Chesnaye,” said the king, “let someone go instantly and find	260.4531323193509
Monsieur de la Trémouille; I wish to speak with him this evening.”	254.47280165869
“Your Majesty gives me your word that you will not see anyone between	319.24301654265616
Monsieur de la Trémouille and myself?”	339.7574012612926
“Nobody, by the faith of a gentleman.”	243.7267525504667
“Tomorrow, then, sire?”	296.90384713769504
“Tomorrow, monsieur.”	329.3673543962952
“At what o’clock, please your Majesty?”	366.7688937161683
“At any hour you will.”	303.8941743153848
“But in coming too early I should be afraid of awakening your Majesty.”	336.6602120046755
“Awaken me! Do you think I ever sleep, then? I sleep no longer,	360.0089689116312
monsieur. I sometimes dream, that’s all. Come, then, as early as you	325.0712130300324
like—at seven o’clock; but beware, if you and your Musketeers are	238.18485510095286
guilty.”	327.15843131804337
“If my Musketeers are guilty, sire, the guilty shall be placed in your	228.98263892874624
Majesty’s hands, who will dispose of them at your good pleasure. Does	190.56303944802818
your Majesty require anything further? Speak, I am ready to obey.”	179.29411797607324
“No, monsieur, no; I am not called Louis the Just without reason.	359.83444444704077
Tomorrow, then, monsieur—tomorrow.”	201.5285382068409
“Till then, God preserve your Majesty!”	366.72056604930225
However ill the king might sleep, M. de Tréville slept still worse. He	178.9641297662284
had ordered his three Musketeers and their companion to be with him at	248.62220997545725
half past six in the morning. He took them with him, without	258.3726542467361
encouraging them or promising them anything, and without concealing	256.0377391467216
from them that their luck, and even his own, depended upon the cast of	221.36236882357616
the dice.	339.5541690574465
Arrived at the foot of the back stairs, he desired them to wait. If the	195.25780151624218
king was still irritated against them, they would depart without being	363.01703195268357
seen; if the king consented to see them, they would only have to be	243.39182731139255
called.	280.088291484322
On arriving at the king’s private antechamber, M. de Tréville found La	299.1871493273594
Chesnaye, who informed him that they had not been able to find M. de la	262.73486465140627
Trémouille on the preceding evening at his hôtel, that he returned too	282.5584796293198
late to present himself at the Louvre, that he had only that moment	345.56507613232094
arrived and that he was at that very hour with the king.	348.88834099456386
This circumstance pleased M. de Tréville much, as he thus became	173.51267527338297
certain that no foreign suggestion could insinuate itself between M. de	218.98127013546275
la Trémouille’s testimony and himself.	171.94807407967795
In fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the	232.75312385028383
king’s closet opened, and M. de Tréville saw M. de la Trémouille come	353.0508119470793
out. The duke came straight up to him, and said: “Monsieur de Tréville,	179.4774177673344
his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the	247.84574570753858
circumstances which took place yesterday at my hôtel. I have told him	338.08710869710455
the truth; that is to say, that the fault lay with my people, and that	305.62020487008067
I was ready to offer you my excuses. Since I have the good fortune to	220.6033471888399
meet you, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of	360.9181869371814
your friends.”	227.90069281419207
“Monsieur the Duke,” said M. de Tréville, “I was so confident of your	294.3404602461568
loyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than	359.3184236824329
yourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I thank you that	327.6065468154944
there is still one man in France of whom may be said, without	356.10363784666333
disappointment, what I have said of you.”	192.76101904108168
“That’s well said,” cried the king, who had heard all these compliments	213.7996867120903
through the open door; “only tell him, Tréville, since he wishes to be	289.44661760541766
considered your friend, that I also wish to be one of his, but he	171.4983195189269
neglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have seen him, and	301.65375862537536
that I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him all this for	179.17314482892232
me, for these are things which a king cannot say for himself.”	347.9103490123648
“Thanks, sire, thanks,” said the duke; “but your Majesty may be assured	191.05854915712425
that it is not those—I do not speak of Monsieur de Tréville—whom your	335.8989003414015
Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you.”	275.23497691076955
“Ah! You have heard what I said? So much the better, Duke, so much the	176.3116160164741
better,” said the king, advancing toward the door. “Ah! It is you,	296.5937377189923
Tréville. Where are your Musketeers? I told you the day before	258.1112674573391
yesterday to bring them with you; why have you not done so?”	262.43679883543933
“They are below, sire, and with your permission La Chesnaye will bid	215.47210517621343
them come up.”	201.29422886600426
“Yes, yes, let them come up immediately. It is nearly eight o’clock,	247.16505321774946
and at nine I expect a visit. Go, Monsieur Duke, and return often. Come	326.5213723391538
in, Tréville.”	221.31063673929498
The Duke saluted and retired. At the moment he opened the door, the	357.0379901119254
three Musketeers and D’Artagnan, conducted by La Chesnaye, appeared at	240.36471696048386
the top of the staircase.	172.96097608287533
“Come in, my braves,” said the king, “come in; I am going to scold	172.82154435578616
you.”	272.8574634873418
The Musketeers advanced, bowing, D’Artagnan following closely behind	363.35495052014926
them.	187.1185000423343
“What the devil!” continued the king. “Seven of his Eminence’s Guards	186.327046143472
placed _hors de combat_ by you four in two days! That’s too many,	174.3045307224584
gentlemen, too many! If you go on so, his Eminence will be forced to	274.8241551423514
renew his company in three weeks, and I to put the edicts in force in	234.10156191957975
all their rigor. One now and then I don’t say much about; but seven in	362.5283560591091
two days, I repeat, it is too many, it is far too many!”	230.26800043796692
“Therefore, sire, your Majesty sees that they are come, quite contrite	279.3214929399069
and repentant, to offer you their excuses.”	272.4870396491209
“Quite contrite and repentant! Hem!” said the king. “I place no	172.30464802876048
confidence in their hypocritical faces. In particular, there is one	289.6558706148936
yonder of a Gascon look. Come hither, monsieur.”	182.20012857749856
D’Artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was	333.7904179245873
addressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.	210.02819126368365
“Why, you told me he was a young man? This is a boy, Tréville, a mere	222.60717237406413
boy! Do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust	290.58415126195575
at Jussac?”	357.54226333393666
“And those two equally fine thrusts at Bernajoux.”	314.8751874289807
“Truly!”	359.6875794400965
“Without reckoning,” said Athos, “that if he had not rescued me from	197.7353895309881
the hands of Cahusac, I should not now have the honor of making my very	335.02700201828293
humble reverence to your Majesty.”	367.4206421368202
“Why he is a very devil, this Béarnais! _Ventre-saint-gris_, Monsieur	182.05089793099944
de Tréville, as the king my father would have said. But at this sort of	274.9146403192382
work, many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken. Now,	288.21311370776993
Gascons are always poor, are they not?”	330.912103802703
“Sire, I can assert that they have hitherto discovered no gold mines in	191.03944425704117
their mountains; though the Lord owes them this miracle in recompense	289.4331403158965
for the manner in which they supported the pretensions of the king your	326.15245352842715
father.”	231.29451547028106
“Which is to say that the Gascons made a king of me, myself, seeing	314.49208737565755
that I am my father’s son, is it not, Tréville? Well, happily, I don’t	305.10479075721196
say nay to it. La Chesnaye, go and see if by rummaging all my pockets	177.77537440321677
you can find forty pistoles; and if you can find them, bring them to	193.06881826665105
me. And now let us see, young man, with your hand upon your conscience,	172.16759561541159
how did all this come to pass?”	227.49804681741165
D’Artagnan related the adventure of the preceding day in all its	352.72874167709233
details; how, not having been able to sleep for the joy he felt in the	210.58456665907045
expectation of seeing his Majesty, he had gone to his three friends	269.4195182865005
three hours before the hour of audience; how they had gone together to	271.7649870035732
the tennis court, and how, upon the fear he had manifested lest he	323.135568831864
receive a ball in the face, he had been jeered at by Bernajoux, who had	298.16857971719696
nearly paid for his jeer with his life, and M. de la Trémouille, who	246.36367042171253
had nothing to do with the matter, with the loss of his hôtel.	368.1755373771455
“This is all very well,” murmured the king, “yes, this is just the	301.52718381732825
account the duke gave me of the affair. Poor cardinal! Seven men in two	320.614481584068
days, and those of his very best! But that’s quite enough, gentlemen;	232.80841616318833
please to understand, that’s enough. You have taken your revenge for	210.88357720990425
the Rue Férou, and even exceeded it; you ought to be satisfied.”	353.0341705179304
“If your Majesty is so,” said Tréville, “we are.”	306.9063895038811
“Oh, yes; I am,” added the king, taking a handful of gold from La	365.62904033323986
Chesnaye, and putting it into the hand of D’Artagnan. “Here,” said he,	215.40324319837447
“is a proof of my satisfaction.”	317.723842943769
At this epoch, the ideas of pride which are in fashion in our days did	369.5130882116756
not prevail. A gentleman received, from hand to hand, money from the	176.35043050968878
king, and was not the least in the world humiliated. D’Artagnan put his	179.1726830907798
forty pistoles into his pocket without any scruple—on the contrary,	343.0834828974995
thanking his Majesty greatly.	281.1861707646784
“There,” said the king, looking at a clock, “there, now, as it is half	361.88769508458097
past eight, you may retire; for as I told you, I expect someone at	322.01404164952044
nine. Thanks for your devotedness, gentlemen. I may continue to rely	193.3236457696685
upon it, may I not?”	184.44042450250723
“Oh, sire!” cried the four companions, with one voice, “we would allow	196.4015015913784
ourselves to be cut to pieces in your Majesty’s service.”	295.65676540933316
“Well, well, but keep whole; that will be better, and you will be more	264.99392383386044
useful to me. Tréville,” added the king, in a low voice, as the others	298.18001146147634
were retiring, “as you have no room in the Musketeers, and as we have	204.61844229441442
besides decided that a novitiate is necessary before entering that	295.77052557890266
corps, place this young man in the company of the Guards of Monsieur	287.2662371914711
Dessessart, your brother-in-law. Ah, _pardieu_, Tréville! I enjoy	331.43946864477687
beforehand the face the cardinal will make. He will be furious; but I	346.7058700750696
don’t care. I am doing what is right.”	341.544487959165
The king waved his hand to Tréville, who left him and rejoined the	176.60976950793776
Musketeers, whom he found sharing the forty pistoles with D’Artagnan.	312.8237446369829
The cardinal, as his Majesty had said, was really furious, so furious	278.1115706827107
that during eight days he absented himself from the king’s gaming	285.9067189107141
table. This did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as	314.8939657789474
possible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone,	357.4309142641373
“Well, Monsieur Cardinal, how fares it with that poor Jussac and that	314.8466327937796
poor Bernajoux of yours?”	301.3952222745871
Chapter VII.	199.12550924627772
THE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS	235.70287045233792
When D’Artagnan was out of the Louvre, and consulted his friends upon	235.1065289975868
the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, Athos	273.18030798211566
advised him to order a good repast at the Pomme-de-Pin, Porthos to	311.25563635346157
engage a lackey, and Aramis to provide himself with a suitable	349.1372169242484
mistress.	287.8413181663494
The repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited	247.4839928061702
at table. The repast had been ordered by Athos, and the lackey	263.14682520286703
furnished by Porthos. He was a Picard, whom the glorious Musketeer had	265.30909300639314
picked up on the Bridge Tournelle, making rings and plashing in the	366.6050818364541
water.	203.67127063799848
Porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and	195.5237730730234
contemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any	312.79374293174845
other recommendation. The noble carriage of this gentleman, for whom he	289.3537058559345
believed himself to be engaged, had won Planchet—that was the name of	337.0469489004756
the Picard. He felt a slight disappointment, however, when he saw that	253.0397942519572
this place was already taken by a compeer named Mousqueton, and when	284.61525534309584
Porthos signified to him that the state of his household, though great,	227.70445079235188
would not support two servants, and that he must enter into the service	293.5503767569484

Athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a	245.78164339848797
